gt_text: MAPFRE
vlm_output: HARPER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "MAPFRE" and the OCR output is "HARPER". So, first, I need to extract the text from the OCR, which is already done here. Then compare them based on the given criteria.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "MAPFRE". The OCR output has "HARPER". Now, considering that we ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Also, check for typos. But "MAPFRE" vs "HARPER"—they are completely different words. There's no overlap in letters that would suggest a typo. For example, if it was "MAPPER" instead of "MAPFRE", maybe there's a typo, but "HARPER" is different. So, the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. Therefore, since there are no matching words, it would be category 3. The unique word in the ground truth isn't present in the OCR output. So the answer should be 3.
