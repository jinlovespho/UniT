gt_text: COCO-MATbike COCO
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "COCO-MATbike COCO" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is just the number 1970. 

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "COCO-MATbike" and "COCO". Let's break down the unique words in the ground truth. The words are "COCO" and "MATbike". Wait, but "COCO-MATbike" is a single word with a hyphen. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, maybe "COCO-MATbike" is considered one word, and "COCO" is another. But the hyphen might be part of the word. Alternatively, maybe the hyphen is treated as punctuation to be ignored. The instructions mention ignoring punctuation, so perhaps "COCO-MATbike" becomes "COCO MATbike" when punctuation is stripped. But the exact instruction is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in the ground truth are "COCO" and "MATbike" (assuming the hyphen is part of the word or split into two words). Wait, the original ground truth is "COCO-MATbike COCO". So splitting by spaces, the first part is "COCO-MATbike" and the second is "COCO". So the unique words here are "COCO-MATbike" and "COCO". However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output is "1970", which is numbers. 

Now, the categories: 

1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, typos.

So the unique ground truth words are "COCO-MATbike" and "COCO". The OCR output is "1970", which is numbers. There's no mention of "COCO" or "MATbike" in the OCR output. Even if we consider typos or case, "1970" doesn't resemble any of the ground truth words. 

So, according to the criteria, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. Because the output is largely wrong and unrelated. The OCR output is a number, which doesn't match any part of the ground truth text. 

Therefore, the answer is category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 123
2. Slightly Correct Num: 57
3. Incorrect Num: 312
