gt_text: MIRAI
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MIRAI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "100%". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MIRAI", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MIRAI". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word "MIRAI". 

Considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "100%" isn't a word that matches "MIRAI" even with those ignored. There's no overlap in the words. Also, small typos still count as matches, but here it's not a typo—it's a completely different type of data (number vs. word). 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3—Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words.
