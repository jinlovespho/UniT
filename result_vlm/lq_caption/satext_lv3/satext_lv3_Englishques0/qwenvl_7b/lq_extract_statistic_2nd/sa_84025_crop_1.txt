gt_text: ESCALATOR END OF
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ESCALATOR END OF" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%". Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "ESCALATOR", "END", and "OF". 

The OCR output is "10%", which is a percentage. The words here are "10" and "%". The ground truth words are all different. Let's check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words, considering the rules. 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Small typos still count as matches. 

So, the ground truth unique words are "ESCALATOR", "END", "OF". The OCR output has "10" and "%". None of these words are present in the ground truth. Even if we consider possible typos or variations, "10%" doesn't seem to relate to any of the ground truth words. 

Therefore, there are no matches. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is largely wrong and unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
