gt_text: VERITAS
vlm_output: dip

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VERITAS" and the VLM OCR output is "dip". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "dip".

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "VERITAS", which is one unique word. The OCR output is "dip", which is another single word.

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "VERITAS" is all caps, but the OCR output is lowercase. If I ignore case, "dip" vs "veritas" – they are different words. Also, small typos still count as matches. But here, "dip" and "veritas" are not typos of each other. They are completely different words.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 otherwise. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("VERITAS") and the OCR output has "dip", which doesn't match. So there are no matches. Therefore, the category should be 3.
