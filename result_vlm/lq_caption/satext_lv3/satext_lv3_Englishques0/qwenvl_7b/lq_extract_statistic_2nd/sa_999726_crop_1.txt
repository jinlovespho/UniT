gt_text: PINKO
vlm_output: PINKO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PINKO" and the VLM OCR output is also "PINKO". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors.

First, the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PINKO". The OCR output also has "PINKO". So, the set of unique words matches exactly.

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here, so not category 2. Definitely not category 3. So the answer is 1.
