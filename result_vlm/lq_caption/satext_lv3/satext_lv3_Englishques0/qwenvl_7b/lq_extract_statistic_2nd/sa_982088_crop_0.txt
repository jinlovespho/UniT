gt_text: 936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO
vlm_output: PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO" and the VLM OCR output is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". Now, the ground truth has numbers and some Spanish words. Let me break down the ground truth into unique words. The words here are "936", "ATELIER", "264", "375", "ESCRITORIO". Wait, but "ATELIER" and "ESCRITORIO" are Spanish words, meaning "workshop" and "office" respectively. The numbers might be part of the address or identifiers.

Now, the OCR output is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". Let's split that into words: "PONTE", "DE", "SANTO", "DOMINGOS". Now, comparing these words to the ground truth words. The ground truth has "ATELIER", "ESCRITORIO", and numbers. The OCR output has "PONTE", "DE", "SANTO", "DOMINGOS". 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "936", "ATELIER", "264", "375", "ESCRITORIO". The OCR output words are "PONTE", "DE", "SANTO", "DOMINGOS". None of these words match any of the ground truth words. The numbers in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output. The OCR output words are all different. Even if we consider typos, there's no overlap. "DE" might be a preposition, but it's not in the ground truth. The words "SANTO DOMINGOS" could be a place name, but that's not part of the ground truth. 

So, according to the criteria: category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, as it's a different set of words entirely. The numbers in the ground truth are not in the OCR output, and the OCR output words don't match any of the ground truth words. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
