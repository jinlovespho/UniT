gt_text: OPEN
vlm_output: 1234567890

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OPEN" and the VLM OCR output is "1234567890". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just numbers, right? So the extracted text is "1234567890".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth "OPEN". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "OPEN". But the OCR output has numbers, not letters. So there's no match here. Also, the categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 53
2. Slightly Correct Num: 24
3. Incorrect Num: 134
