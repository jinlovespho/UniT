Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "USAirmail 13 13 USAirmail". The VLM OCR output is "13+ USAirmail". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "13+ USAirmail". Now, comparing this with the ground truth.

The ground truth has the words "USAirmail", "13", and "13" again. But since we're considering unique words, the unique words in the ground truth are "USAirmail" and "13".

Now, looking at the OCR output: "13+" and "USAirmail". The "13+" might be a typo or a variation of "13". The problem says small typos still count as matches. So "13+" could be considered a match for "13" if the '+' is a typo. Also, "USAirmail" is present in the OCR output as "USAirmail".

So the unique words in the OCR output are "13+" and "USAirmail". Comparing to the ground truth's unique words "13" and "USAirmail". The "USAirmail" matches exactly. The "13+" might be considered a match for "13" since it's a small typo (adding a '+'). 

Therefore, both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, considering typos. So according to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct.
