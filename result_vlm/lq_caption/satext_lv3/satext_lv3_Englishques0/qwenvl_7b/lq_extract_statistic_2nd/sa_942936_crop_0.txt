gt_text: HONDA
vlm_output: 100%

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "HONDA" and the OCR output is "100%". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percentage sign.

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HONDA". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The OCR output has numbers and a percentage, which are not related to the word "HONDA". The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but in this case, the OCR output doesn't even have the same words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "100%" has no words from "HONDA", it's category 3. Even if there were typos, like "honda" vs "hondA", but here the OCR output is completely different. So the answer should be 3.
