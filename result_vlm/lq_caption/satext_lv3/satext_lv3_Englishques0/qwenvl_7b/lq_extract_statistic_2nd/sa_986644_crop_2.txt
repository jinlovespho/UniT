Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "FRUIT", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "FRUIT".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "FRUIT". Now, the comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me go through them one by one.

The first point says word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here. The second point says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT". The OCR output also has "FRUIT", which is the same. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces, so that's a match. The note about small typos still counting as matches—there are no typos here since they are identical.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both have the same single word, that's a full match. So the answer should be 1. There's no partial match or incorrect elements here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match under the given criteria.
