gt_text: Victoria Station
vlm_output: Victoria Station

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria Station" and the VLM OCR output is also "Victoria Station". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, the extracted text is "Victoria Station".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they are in the same order.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Victoria" and "Station". The OCR output also has the same two words. 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing, so no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is identical to the ground truth.

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and all words match even when considering the allowed variations. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 11
2. Slightly Correct Num: 4
3. Incorrect Num: 20
