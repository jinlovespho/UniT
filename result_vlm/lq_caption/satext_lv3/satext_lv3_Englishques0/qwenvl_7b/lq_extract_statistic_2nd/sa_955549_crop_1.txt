gt_text: FURLA
vlm_output: 1024

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FURLA" and the VLM OCR output is "1024". So, I need to compare these two based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1024", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FURLA", which is a word, probably a brand name or something. 

Now step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is numbers, and the ground truth is letters. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "FURLA". The OCR output has "1024", which is numbers. Since there's no overlap between letters and numbers, even considering typos, I don't think "1024" can be considered a match for "FURLA". The rules mention small typos count as matches, but this is a complete mismatch in terms of characters. 

So, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since there are no matching words, it's category 3.
