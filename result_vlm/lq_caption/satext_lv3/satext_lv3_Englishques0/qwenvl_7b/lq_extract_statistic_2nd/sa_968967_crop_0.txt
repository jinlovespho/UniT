gt_text: 8238888 100
vlm_output: SUNRISE TOWER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "8238888 100" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's "SUNRISE TOWER".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "8238888" and "100". These are numbers. The OCR output has words: "SUNRISE" and "TOWER". 

Now, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth has numbers, not words. So maybe the unique words here are "8238888" and "100"? But those are numbers, not words. However, the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth text is numbers. So perhaps the words here are the numbers, but they are not actual words. 

But the OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER", which are actual words. The ground truth has numbers. So there's no overlap in words. The ground truth's unique words (if we consider numbers as words) are "8238888" and "100". The OCR output's words are "SUNRISE" and "TOWER". None of these match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 otherwise. Since none of the words from the ground truth (numbers) are present in the OCR output (words), then it's category 3. 

But wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If the ground truth is "8238888 100", are those considered words? If the OCR output is supposed to capture text, but the ground truth is numbers, then the OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER" which is unrelated. So no matches. Hence category 3.
