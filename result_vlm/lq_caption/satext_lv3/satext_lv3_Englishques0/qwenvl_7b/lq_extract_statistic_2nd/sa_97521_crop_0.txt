gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD BLVD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". So the extracted text is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD".

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is "HOLLYWOOD". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has two words: "HOLLYWOOD" and "BLVD". 

Now, checking if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The word "HOLLYWOOD" is present exactly as is in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output is "BLVD", which isn't part of the ground truth. However, since the ground truth only has "HOLLYWOOD", we just need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

Since "HOLLYWOOD" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word "BLVD", the category would be 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present. The presence of extra words doesn't affect the category here because the criteria are about the unique words from the ground truth being present, regardless of additional words. 

Also, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored (though both are uppercase here), and there are no typos in "HOLLYWOOD" in the OCR output. So the OCR output includes the exact word from the ground truth, even with an extra word. Therefore, category 1 is correct.
