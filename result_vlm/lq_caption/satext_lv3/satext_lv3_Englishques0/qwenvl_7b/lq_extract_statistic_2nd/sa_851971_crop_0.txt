gt_text: HOTEL MUSEUM
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "HOTEL MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. Now, step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the key is that the OCR output must contain all unique ground truth words to be category 1, at least one for category 2, and otherwise category 3.

The ground truth has two unique words: "HOTEL" and "MUSEUM". The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, looking at the words in the OCR output, there's "100" and "%". The ground truth words are "HOTEL" and "MUSEUM". None of these words are present in the OCR output. The numbers and symbols don't match the words in the ground truth. 

Considering the criteria, since there are no matching words (even after ignoring case, etc.), this would fall into category 3. The OCR output is completely unrelated to the ground truth words. Even if there were a typo or something, like "hotl" instead of "hotel", but here it's "100%", which is not related. So the answer should be 3.
