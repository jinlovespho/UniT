gt_text: 131 BEAT 艺术空间
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "131 BEAT 艺术空间" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1970", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "131", "BEAT", and "艺术空间". The OCR output has "1970". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, we look at unique words in the ground truth. Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Also, small typos count as matches. But here, the OCR output is a number, and the ground truth has a mix of numbers, a word, and another term in Chinese.

Breaking down the ground truth words: "131" (a number), "BEAT" (a word), "艺术空间" (Chinese characters meaning "art space"). The OCR output is "1970", which is a number. 

Looking for matches. The number "1970" doesn't contain "131" (though maybe "1" is a part of it, but the rules say small typos count, but "1970" isn't a typo of "131"—they are different numbers. Also, the other words like "BEAT" and "艺术空间" aren't present in the OCR output. 

So, the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth. Even if we consider "1" from "131" and "1970", that's not matching the entire word. The rules say that small typos still count as matches, but "1970" isn't a typo of "131"—it's a different number. So no matches here. 

Therefore, the category would be 3 — Incorrect, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
