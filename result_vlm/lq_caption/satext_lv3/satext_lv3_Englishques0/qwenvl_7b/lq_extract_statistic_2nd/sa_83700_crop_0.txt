gt_text: COVENT GARDEN COVENT GARDEN
vlm_output: Wheels

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "COVENT GARDEN COVENT GARDEN", and the VLM OCR output is "Wheels". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "Wheels". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "COVENT" and "GARDEN". The OCR output is "Wheels", which is a single word. 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output has "Wheels", which isn't "COVENT" or "GARDEN". Even if I ignore capitalization, "Wheels" still doesn't match either of the ground truth words. There are no typos here because "Wheels" is entirely different from the expected words. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3—Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
