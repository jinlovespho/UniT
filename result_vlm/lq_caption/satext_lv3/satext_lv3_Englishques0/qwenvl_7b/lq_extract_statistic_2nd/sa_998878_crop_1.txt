gt_text: UNITED STATES ARMY
vlm_output: 105-0742

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNITED STATES ARMY". The OCR output is "105-0742". So, first step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "105-0742", which looks like a number with a hyphen.

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: UNITED, STATES, ARMY. The OCR output doesn't have any of these words. The numbers and hyphen don't match any of the words in the ground truth. 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is just numbers and a hyphen. There's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

Also, the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique words from ground truth are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no matching words, it's category 3.
