gt_text: Year Happy New
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Year Happy New" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "Year", "Happy", and "New". The OCR output is "10%", which is a single token. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. However, the OCR output here is "10%", which is a number, not any of the words in the ground truth. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just no overlap in words. The OCR output doesn't contain "Year", "Happy", or "New" in any form. Even if I ignore punctuation, "10%" doesn't relate to any of those words. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
