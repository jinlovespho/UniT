gt_text: Office
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Office" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "Office".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Office". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't have the word "Office" in any form. Even if we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, "100%" doesn't contain "Office". There's no overlap in the words. Also, small typos aren't an issue here because the OCR output is entirely different. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3 — Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the required word.
