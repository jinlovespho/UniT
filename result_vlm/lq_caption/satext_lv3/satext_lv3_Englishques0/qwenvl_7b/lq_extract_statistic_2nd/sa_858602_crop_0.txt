gt_text: PLATZ
vlm_output: FIAT

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "PLATZ" and the OCR output is "FIAT". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR, which is just "FIAT". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one word: "PLATZ". The OCR output has "FIAT". Now, I need to check if "FIAT" matches "PLATZ" considering the rules. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, so both are uppercase, but that's the same here. Punctuation and spaces are ignored, but there's none here. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. But "FIAT" and "PLATZ" are different words. "FIAT" is a car brand, while "PLATZ" is German for "place". They don't look like typos of each other. 

The unique words in ground truth are just "PLATZ". The OCR output has "FIAT", which isn't a match. So no words match. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. But wait, the category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But here, there's only one word in ground truth, and it's not present. So category 3 applies because there are no matches. So the answer should be 3.
