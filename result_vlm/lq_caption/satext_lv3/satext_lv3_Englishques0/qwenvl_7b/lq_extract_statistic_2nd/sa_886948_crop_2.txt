Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FM AM" and the VLM OCR output is "AMFM". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "AMFM". Then step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has two words: "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth's unique words are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single word. But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be split into words? Or is it treated as a single word?

Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words: "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM". If we split the OCR output into words, maybe it's "AM" and "FM"? But the OCR output is written as "AMFM" without spaces. However, the instructions mention ignoring extra or missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered as "AMFM", but we should split it into words as per the original ground truth's words? Or is the OCR output treated as a single string?

Wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words: "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM". Now, if we consider the OCR output as a single word, then it doesn't have "FM" or "AM" as separate words. But maybe we should split the OCR output into possible words. However, the OCR output is "AMFM" which could be split into "AM" and "FM", which are the same as the ground truth. But since the OCR output is a single string, maybe the model didn't split it into words. But the instructions say to ignore extra or missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "AMFM", but the ground truth is "FM AM", then perhaps the OCR output is missing the space but has the correct letters. However, the problem states that word order doesn't matter. So if the OCR output is "AMFM", but we can split it into "AM" and "FM", which are the same as the ground truth words. So in that case, both words are present. So the answer would be category 1.

Wait, but the OCR output is a single word. But the ground truth has two words. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. So the ground truth's unique words are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output's text is "AMFM". If we split it into "AM" and "FM", then both words are present. But how do we know how to split it? The problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces, so maybe the OCR output is considered as "AMFM" but we can split it into words as "AM" and "FM". Since the ground truth's words are "FM" and "AM", both are present in the OCR output. So even though the OCR output is a single string, the words are present. Therefore, category 1.

But wait, the problem says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output" which is "AMFM". Then compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words. The OCR output is a single string. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output's text is "AMFM", which may or may not contain the words "FM" and "AM". However, since the OCR output is "AMFM", which is a concatenation of "AM" and "FM", but without a space. However, the instructions say to ignore extra or missing spaces. So even if the OCR output is "AMFM", we can consider that it contains "AM" and "FM" as words. Therefore, both words are present, so category 1.

Another angle: the OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single word. The ground truth has two words. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output's text is "AMFM". If we split it into "AM" and "FM", which are the same as the ground truth words. So even though the OCR output is a single string, the words are present. Therefore, category 1.

So the answer is 1.
