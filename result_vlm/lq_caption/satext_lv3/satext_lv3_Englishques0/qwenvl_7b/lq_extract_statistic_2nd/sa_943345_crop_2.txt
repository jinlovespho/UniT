gt_text: INS ROCK
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INS ROCK" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the percentage symbol and the numbers 1 and 0. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "INS" and "ROCK". The OCR output has "10%", which doesn't include either of those words. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth, even if order didn't matter, there's no match. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but in this case, the OCR output is entirely different in terms of content. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "10%" has no words that match "INS" or "ROCK", even with typos considered, there's no match. Therefore, it falls under category 3.
