gt_text: LINES SKY ECO Harmony with Nature
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LINES SKY ECO Harmony with Nature" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, I have to compare this with the ground truth text based on the given criteria.

The ground truth has the words: LINES, SKY, ECO, Harmony, with, Nature. Let's note that the words are case-insensitive, so "Harmony" and "harmony" would be the same. Also, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output doesn't have any of those words. It's just a percentage. So none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos or case, it's unrelated. Therefore, the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 66
2. Slightly Correct Num: 26
3. Incorrect Num: 152
