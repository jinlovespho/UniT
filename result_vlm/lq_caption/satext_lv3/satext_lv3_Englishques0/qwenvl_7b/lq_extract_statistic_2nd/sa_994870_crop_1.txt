Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "52" and the VLM OCR output is also "52". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "52", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "52".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth is "52", which is a single number. The OCR output is the same. Since both are exactly the same, even though they're numbers, they should be considered as matching. The unique words in the ground truth are just "52". The OCR output has "52" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, and it's a match, this should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Even if there were typos, like "52" vs "52" (but they are same here), but the problem says small typos still count as matches. So even if there was a typo, it would still be considered correct. But in this case, there's no typo. So definitely category 1.
