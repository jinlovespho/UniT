gt_text: ART
vlm_output: ART

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ART" and the VLM OCR output is also "ART". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ART".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "ART". The OCR output is the same. Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, the category should be 1. There's no case where part of it matches here because it's exactly the same. So the answer is 1.
