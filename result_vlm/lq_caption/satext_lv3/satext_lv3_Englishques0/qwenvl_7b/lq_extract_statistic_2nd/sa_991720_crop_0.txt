gt_text: SPEEDWAY
vlm_output: 1

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPEEDWAY" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SPEEDWAY". The OCR output is a single digit. Since the OCR output is a number, there's no text that matches "SPEEDWAY" even considering the rules. The rules mention ignoring case, spacing, punctuation, but the OCR output isn't even a word. Also, the unique words in the ground truth are just "SPEEDWAY". The OCR output doesn't have that word or any part of it. 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output is "1", which is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
