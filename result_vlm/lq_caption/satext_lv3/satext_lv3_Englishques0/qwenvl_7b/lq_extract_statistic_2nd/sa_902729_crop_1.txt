gt_text: Keep clear
vlm_output: !

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Keep clear" and the VLM OCR output is "!".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just an exclamation mark, which is a punctuation mark, not a word. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Keep" and "clear". The OCR output has no words, just a punctuation. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since the OCR output has no words, there's nothing to compare. Also, the categories mention that if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there were typos, but here there are no words at all. So, the OCR output is empty in terms of words. 

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3.
