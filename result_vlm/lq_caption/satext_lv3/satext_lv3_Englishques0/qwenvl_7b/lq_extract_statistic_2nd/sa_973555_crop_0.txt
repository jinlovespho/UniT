gt_text: AMP
vlm_output: AMP

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "AMP". The OCR output also has "AMP". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. There's no typo mentioned here because they are identical. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "AMP" is the only word and it matches exactly, the answer should be 1.
