gt_text: TEATRO SOLIS
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TEATRO SOLIS" and the VLM OCR output is the same: "TEATRO SOLIS". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since it's exactly the same.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Both have the same words, so order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are all caps, same spacing. No typos mentioned here. So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no missing or extra words, and even if there were small typos, they would still count as matches. Since everything is exactly the same, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
