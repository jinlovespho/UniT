gt_text: POLITIE POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLITIE POLITIE", and the VLM OCR output is "POLITIE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "POLITIE". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "POLITIE" repeated twice, but as a set, the unique word is just "POLITIE".

The OCR output has "POLITIE" once. Since the ground truth's unique words are only "POLITIE", and the OCR output contains that same word, even though it's missing the second instance, but according to the rules, we're only comparing the set of unique words. Also, the rules mention that small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "POLITIE") are present in the OCR output, that should be category 1. Even though the OCR output has one instance instead of two, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. The ground truth's unique words are covered. So the answer is 1.
