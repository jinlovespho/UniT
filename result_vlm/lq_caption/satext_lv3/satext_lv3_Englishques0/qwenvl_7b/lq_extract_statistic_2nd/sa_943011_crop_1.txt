gt_text: BAKERY
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BAKERY" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "BAKERY". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the rules: we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "BAKERY". The OCR output's text is "100%", which is not a word that matches "BAKERY" in any way. 

Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number, not a word. There's no mention of "bakery" or any variation of it in the OCR output. 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo because the OCR output doesn't even contain the word. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
