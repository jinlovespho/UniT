gt_text: CENTER MEDICAL
vlm_output: 1970

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CENTER MEDICAL" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is a number. The ground truth has two words: "CENTER" and "MEDICAL". 

Now, comparing the extracted text "1970" with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "1970" is a number, not any of the words "CENTER" or "MEDICAL". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 
2 if at least one but not all match, 
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "1970" doesn't contain either "CENTER" or "MEDICAL", there are no matches. Also, the OCR output is a number, which is unrelated to the medical center name. Therefore, this should fall into category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 210
2. Slightly Correct Num: 106
3. Incorrect Num: 548
