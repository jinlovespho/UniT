gt_text: YP700
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "YP700" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "YP700".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "YP700". The OCR output is "10%". Let's check if there's any overlap. The OCR output has "10" and "%". The ground truth has "YP700". There's no commonality between "YP700" and "10%". Even if we consider typos, "YP700" isn't close to "10%". The numbers are different, and the letters in the ground truth (Y, P) aren't present in the OCR output. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match at all, so it's not partially correct or correct.
