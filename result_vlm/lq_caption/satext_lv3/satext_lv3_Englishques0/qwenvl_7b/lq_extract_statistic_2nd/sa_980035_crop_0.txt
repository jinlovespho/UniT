gt_text: RANCH THE HOUSE
vlm_output: 10

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RANCH THE HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "10". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "RANCH", "THE", and "HOUSE". 

But the OCR output is "10", which is a number. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but "10" is just digits. The ground truth words are all letters. So there's no overlap in terms of words. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since "10" doesn't contain any of the words "ranch", "the", or "house" (even if we consider case-insensitive or ignore spaces, but "10" is numbers, not letters), there are no matches. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
