Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GAZIN" and the VLM OCR output is also "GAZIN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "GAZIN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "GAZIN".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "GAZIN" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring case, but both are uppercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here because they are exactly the same. 

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match here because the OCR output has exactly the same word. So the answer should be 1.
