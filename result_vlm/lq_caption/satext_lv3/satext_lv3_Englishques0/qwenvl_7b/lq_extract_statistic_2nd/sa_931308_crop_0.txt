gt_text: Platform
vlm_output: Platform 1

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "Platform" and the VLM OCR output is "Platform 1". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and categorize the result into 1, 2, or 3.

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Platform 1". So the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "Platform", which is a single word. So the unique words in ground truth are just {"Platform"}.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "Platform" and "platform" are the same, and "Platform 1" would have "Platform" and "1" as separate words, but we need to check if those match the ground truth's unique words.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there was a typo like "Platfrom", it would still be considered a match for "Platform".

Now, the categories are:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "Platform", we need to check if "Platform" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "Platform 1", which includes "Platform" as a word. The "1" is an extra word, but since the ground truth only has "Platform", we just need that one word to be present. 

So according to the criteria, since the OCR output contains the word "Platform" (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), even though there's an extra "1", it's still considered correct because all unique words from the ground truth are present. The presence of an extra word doesn't affect this, because the comparison is only based on the ground truth's unique words. 

Therefore, the category should be 1. The answer is 1.
