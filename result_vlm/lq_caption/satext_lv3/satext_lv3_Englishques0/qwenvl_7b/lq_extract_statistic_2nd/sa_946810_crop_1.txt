gt_text: Santander Santander
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Santander Santander", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "100%". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of "Santander", but the OCR output is a percentage. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Santander" (since both are the same word). 

Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output has no words related to "Santander". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percent sign. There's no mention of "Santander" in the OCR text. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain "Santander" at all, there are no matches. So it should be category 3. 

Even if I consider typos or other factors, "100%" is completely unrelated. So the answer is 3.
