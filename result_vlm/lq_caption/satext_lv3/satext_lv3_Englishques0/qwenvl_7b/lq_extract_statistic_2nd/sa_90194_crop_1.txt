gt_text: MEGALUX CARELLO
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MEGALUX CARELLO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. There's no text related to "MEGALUX" or "CARELLO" here.

Moving to Step 2, we need to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "MEGALUX" and "CARELLO". 

Now, the OCR output is "100%". Let's break it down. The words here are "100" and "%". Neither of these are related to "MEGALUX" or "CARELLO". The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but even if we consider "100%" as just "100" (ignoring the %), there's still no match. Also, the category criteria state that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in words at all. 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Here, none are present.
- Category 2 is for at least one but not all. But again, there are zero matches here.
- Category 3 is for no words matching or the output being unrelated. Since "100%" is completely unrelated to the ground truth words, this fits Category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
