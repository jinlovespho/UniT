Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "32" and the VLM OCR output is also "32". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "32", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "32".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly "32". 

The ground truth has the word "32", and the OCR output also has "32". Since they're the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There's only one unique word here, so it's a complete match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Here, it's all, so category 1. I don't see any typos or differences. Even if there were a typo, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. So the answer should be 1.
