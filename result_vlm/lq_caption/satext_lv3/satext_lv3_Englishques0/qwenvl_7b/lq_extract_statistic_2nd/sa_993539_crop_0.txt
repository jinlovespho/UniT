gt_text: de
vlm_output: de

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "de" and the VLM OCR output is also "de". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is just "de". Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "de" is a single word. The OCR output is also "de". Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue with capitalization, spacing, or typos. The unique words in the ground truth are just "de", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

According to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. Also, the output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
