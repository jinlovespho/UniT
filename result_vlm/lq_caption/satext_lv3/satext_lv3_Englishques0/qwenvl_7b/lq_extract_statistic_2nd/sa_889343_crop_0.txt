gt_text: VIP
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VIP" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "VIP". Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has only one unique word: "VIP". 

Now, looking at the OCR output, "100%", does it contain "VIP"? Well, "100%" is a number and a percentage sign. The word "VIP" is an acronym, so there's no overlap here. The OCR output doesn't have the letters V, I, P in sequence. Even if we consider typos, but "100%" is completely different. Also, ignoring case and punctuation, but "100%" becomes "100" which still isn't related to "VIP".

So, according to the categories, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 3 — Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth.
