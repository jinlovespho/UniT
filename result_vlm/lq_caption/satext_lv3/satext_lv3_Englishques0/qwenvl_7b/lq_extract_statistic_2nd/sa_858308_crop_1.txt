gt_text: MADISON SQUARE GARDEN CHASE
vlm_output: The image contains no visible text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MADISON SQUARE GARDEN CHASE". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains no visible text." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is stating that there's no visible text in the image. So the extracted text is just that sentence.

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output here is saying there's no text, which is a statement, not the actual text present.

The ground truth has the words: Madison, Square, Garden, Chase. The OCR output's text is "The image contains no visible text." So the words here are The, image, contains, no, visible, text. None of these words match the ground truth words. Even if we consider "text" as a word, the ground truth words are all proper nouns (names of places), while the OCR output is talking about the absence of text. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but not all. But there's no match here. Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated or empty. Since the OCR output is stating there's no text, which is unrelated to the actual text present (the ground truth), this would fall under category 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
