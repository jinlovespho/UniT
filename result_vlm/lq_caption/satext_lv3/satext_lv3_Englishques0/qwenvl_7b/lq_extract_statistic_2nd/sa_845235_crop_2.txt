gt_text: GALLERY HERE> ENTER
vlm_output: GALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GALLERY HERE> ENTER". The VLM OCR output is just "GALLERY". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "GALLERY". 

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: GALLERY, HERE, and ENTER. But the OCR only captured "GALLERY". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are GALLERY, HERE, ENTER. The OCR output has only GALLERY. 

So, the OCR output has one of the three unique words. The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. 

Since only one word matches, it's category 2—partially correct. Even though the OCR missed HERE and ENTER, but at least one word (GALLERY) is present. The typos aren't an issue here since there's no typo in GALLERY. 

So the answer should be 2.
