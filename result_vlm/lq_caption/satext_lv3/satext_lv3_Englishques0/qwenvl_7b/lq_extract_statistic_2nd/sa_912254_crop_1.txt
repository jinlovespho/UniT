gt_text: CHASE CHASE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHASE CHASE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is the word "CHASE" repeated twice.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CHASE". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word "CHASE". 

Next, I need to check if "100%" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. Since "100%" is a number and not the word "CHASE", there's no match. The problem also mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—it's a completely different type of content. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since there's no match here, it's not Category 1. Category 2 is for partial matches, but since there are no matches at all, it can't be Category 2. That leaves Category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the correct category is 3.
