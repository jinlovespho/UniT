gt_text: DiGi DiGi DiGi DiGi
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DiGi DiGi DiGi DiGi". So, the unique words here are just "DiGi" since it's repeated. The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First step is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "100%". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are only "DiGi". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, comparing "100%" to "DiGi". The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "100%" is a number, not a word. The unique words in the ground truth are "DiGi", which is a word. The OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. There's no "DiGi" in "100%". Even if I consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "DiGi". They are completely different. 

So, the OCR output has no matching words. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
