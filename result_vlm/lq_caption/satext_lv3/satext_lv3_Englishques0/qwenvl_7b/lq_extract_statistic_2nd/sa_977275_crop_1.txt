gt_text: OXYGEN
vlm_output: OXYGEN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OXYGEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "OXYGEN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OXYGEN".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "OXYGEN". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. So all unique words in the ground truth (just "OXYGEN") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word, and it's fully matched. So the answer is 1.
