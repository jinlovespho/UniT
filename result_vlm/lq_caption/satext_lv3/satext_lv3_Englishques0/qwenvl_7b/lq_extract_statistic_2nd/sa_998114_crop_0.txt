Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "24" and the VLM OCR output is also "24". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "24", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both are just "24", so order isn't an issue here.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "24". The OCR output also has "24". So, the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations are about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both texts are just numbers without any letters or punctuation, these factors don't come into play here. Also, there are no typos to consider because both are exactly the same.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "24" is present in both, this fits Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
