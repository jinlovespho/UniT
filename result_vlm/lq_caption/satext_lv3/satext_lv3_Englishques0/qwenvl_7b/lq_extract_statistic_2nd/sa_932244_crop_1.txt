gt_text: 26 15 15H
vlm_output: POLICE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "26 15 15H" and the OCR output is "POLICE". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "POLICE". Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the numbers 26, 15, 15H. Wait, but the OCR output is "POLICE", which is a word, not numbers. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the ground truth has numbers and letters, while the OCR output has a different word. Let me think: the unique words in the ground truth are "26", "15", and "15H". Are these considered as words? The OCR output is "POLICE", which is a single word. 

The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has three unique elements: "26", "15", "15H". The OCR output is "POLICE", which is a different word. None of the words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if we consider typos, "POLICE" doesn't match any of those numbers. 

So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. But wait, the instruction says "ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces". But the ground truth has numbers and letters, and the OCR output is a different word. So there's no overlap. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
