Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "Flowers Janet's Flowers" and the OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%". 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

So, the ground truth has the words "Flowers" and "Janet's". Let me break that down. The unique words are "Flowers" and "Janet's". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of those words. 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match. "100%" doesn't have "Flowers" or "Janet's". Even if I consider typos, there's no way "100%" can be a typo for either of those words. The OCR output is completely unrelated. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none or it's wrong. Since none of the words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it should be category 3. The OCR output is just a percentage, which doesn't relate to the flower shop name. So the answer is 3.
