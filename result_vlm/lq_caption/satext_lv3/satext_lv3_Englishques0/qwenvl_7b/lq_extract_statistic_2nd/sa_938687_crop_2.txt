Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is just "1", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "1".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "1", which is a single unique word.

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since both are just "1", there's nothing to ignore here. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos because both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has one unique word, "1", and the OCR output has the same. So all unique words match. Therefore, it should be category 1.

Wait, but what if there's a case where the OCR output had a typo but still matched? Like if the ground truth was "1" and OCR was "l" or "I"? But in this case, both are "1", so no issue. So the answer is 1.
