gt_text: GEOTAB
vlm_output: GEOTAB

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "GEOTAB" and the VLM OCR output is also "GEOTAB". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth. 

Next, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, they are the same.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "GEOTAB". The OCR output also has "GEOTAB". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
