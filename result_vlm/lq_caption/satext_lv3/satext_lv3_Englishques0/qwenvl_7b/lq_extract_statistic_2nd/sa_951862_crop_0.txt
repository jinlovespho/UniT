gt_text: 154 T
vlm_output: 154

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "154 T" and the VLM OCR output is "154". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "154". Then compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are "154" and "T". The OCR output has "154" but misses "T".

The categories are based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output is missing "T", that would mean not all words match. But the problem says "small typos still count as matches", but here it's not a typo, it's a missing word. So the OCR output has one of the two words. 

So according to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. The answer should be 2.
