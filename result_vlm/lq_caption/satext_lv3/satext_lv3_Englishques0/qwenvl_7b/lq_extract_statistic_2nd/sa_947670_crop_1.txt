gt_text: RYANAIR
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RYANAIR" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors.

The key points for comparison are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "RYANAIR" is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. The unique words in the ground truth are just "RYANAIR". The OCR output doesn't have that word. 

Now, checking the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Since "RYANAIR" isn't in "100%", this doesn't apply.
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match. But there are no matches here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words.
- Category 3: No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "RYANAIR" and there are no matches, this fits.

So the answer should be category 3.
