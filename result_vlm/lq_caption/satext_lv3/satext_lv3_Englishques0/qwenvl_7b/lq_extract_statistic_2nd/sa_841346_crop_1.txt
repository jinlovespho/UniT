gt_text: RUSSIA
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RUSSIA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "RUSSIA", which is a country name.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RUSSIA". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Next, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "RUSSIA" isn't present in "100%". The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain "RUSSIA" or any of its variations (ignoring case, etc.), there are no matches. Therefore, it falls under category 3.
