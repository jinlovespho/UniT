gt_text: CJ03ADM DUSTER
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CJ03ADM DUSTER". The OCR output from the VLM is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has two parts: "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER". The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has "100%", which is a single word. 

But wait, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER" aren't in "100%". So none of the unique words match. Also, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. 

According to the categories, if no words match or the output is largely wrong, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
