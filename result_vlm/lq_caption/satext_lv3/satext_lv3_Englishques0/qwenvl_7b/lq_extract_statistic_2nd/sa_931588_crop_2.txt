gt_text: 24
vlm_output: No parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "24", and the VLM OCR output is "No parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "No parking".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the number "24". The OCR output has the words "No" and "parking". 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and ignore case, punctuation, spaces, etc. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth is "24", which is a single number. The OCR output is "No parking", which are two words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "24". The OCR output has "No" and "parking". 

So, the question is whether "No parking" contains the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "24", but the OCR output doesn't have "24" at all. There's no mention of numbers in the OCR output. The OCR output is about a parking restriction, which is unrelated to the number 24. 

Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is not just missing the word but is entirely unrelated. 

So the answer should be category 3.
