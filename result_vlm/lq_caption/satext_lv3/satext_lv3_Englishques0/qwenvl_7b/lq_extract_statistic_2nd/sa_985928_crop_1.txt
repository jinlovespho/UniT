gt_text: TREZOR
vlm_output: TREZOR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TREZOR" and the VLM OCR output is also "TREZOR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "TREZOR".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TREZOR". The OCR output also has "TREZOR".

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and no spaces, so that's fine. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since they're the same.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "TREZOR") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. The answer should be 1.
