Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "13" and the VLM OCR output is also "13". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "13", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are just single numbers. Since there's only one "word" (assuming numbers are considered words here), the order isn't an issue. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "13" as the only unique word. The OCR output also has "13". So they match exactly. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But since both are just "13", there's no difference in case, punctuation, or spacing. Also, typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "13" is the only one and it's present, it's category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
