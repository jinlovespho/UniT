gt_text: MED FRIGO
vlm_output: SALSA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MED FRIGO" and the VLM OCR output is "SALSA". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SALSA", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "MED" and "FRIGO". The OCR output is "SALSA", which is one word. Let's break it down.

First, check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth words are "MED" and "FRIGO". The OCR output is "SALSA". Now, considering case doesn't matter, but "SALSA" doesn't seem to have any letters that match "MED" or "FRIGO". Let me check for possible typos. For example, maybe "SALSA" could be a typo for "FRIGO"? But "SALSA" is S-A-L-S-A, while "FRIGO" is F-R-I-G-O. There's no overlap in letters that would suggest a typo here. Similarly, "MED" is M-E-D, which also doesn't match any part of "SALSA".

Since there are no matching words, even considering typos, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect, because no words match, and the output is unrelated.
