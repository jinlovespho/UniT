gt_text: FIT
vlm_output: 2018

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FIT" and the VLM OCR output is "2018". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2018", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FIT", which are letters. 

Now, step 2 is comparing them. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output has numbers, and the ground truth has letters. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "FIT". The OCR output has "2018", which is four digits. Since there's no overlap between the letters and numbers, there's no matching word. Even if I consider typos, "2018" doesn't resemble "FIT" in any way. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique words match. Here, none do. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's no match at all, it's category 3: incorrect. The output is unrelated and has no words from the ground truth.
