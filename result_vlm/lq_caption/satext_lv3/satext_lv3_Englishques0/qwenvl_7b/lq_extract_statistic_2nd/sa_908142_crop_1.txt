gt_text: EPSON Castrol
vlm_output: EPSONCastrol

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EPSON Castrol" and the VLM OCR output is "EPSONCastrol". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "EPSONCastrol". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So, I should split both into words. The ground truth has two words: "EPSON" and "Castrol". The OCR output is "EPSONCastrol" which is a single word without a space. 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output, when split, would be one word. However, since there's no space, maybe it's considered as one word. But the OCR output might have merged the two words into one. 

But the rules mention that extra or missing spaces are ignored. So, even if the OCR output has no space between "EPSON" and "Castrol", it's considered as the same as the ground truth. Also, capitalization is ignored. The OCR output has "EPSONCastrol" which is all caps for EPSON and lowercase for Castrol? Wait, no, the OCR output is "EPSONCastrol" – the first part is EPSON (all caps) and then Castrol (capitalized). But the ground truth is "EPSON Castrol" with a space. However, the comparison ignores spaces, so the OCR output's lack of space doesn't matter. 

So, the OCR output has "EPSONCastrol", which is the combination of "EPSON" and "Castrol" without a space. Since spaces are ignored, this would be considered as containing both words. Also, the words are the same except for the space. So, the OCR output has both words present, just merged. 

Therefore, all unique ground truth words ("EPSON" and "Castrol") are present in the OCR output. Even though they are merged, the rules say to ignore spaces. So, the category would be 1 — Correct. 

I think that's right. The key points are that the words are present, even if merged, and spaces are ignored. Typos are allowed, but there are no typos here. So, category 1.
