gt_text: CONTAINER TERMINAL BALTIC RMINAL
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "CONTAINER TERMINAL BALTIC RMINAL". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth words. The ground truth has four words: CONTAINER, TERMINAL, BALTIC, and RMINAL. Wait, RMINAL might be a typo for TERMINAL? But the problem says to consider small typos as matches. But in this case, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of those words.

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is just "100%", which doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "100%" is just a number. There's no match for CONTAINER, TERMINAL, BALTIC, or RMINAL. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Even if there was a typo, like maybe "100%" was supposed to be something else, but in this case, it's just a percentage. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
