gt_text: EEN 1-125
vlm_output: PILGRIM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EEN 1-125" and the VLM OCR output is "PILGRIM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "PILGRIM". Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "EEN" and "1-125". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. Here, "EEN" and "1-125" are the unique words. Now, I need to check if these words appear in the OCR output, considering case, spacing, and typos.

The OCR output is "PILGRIM". Let's break it down. The word "PILGRIM" doesn't seem to contain "EEN" or "1-125". Even if I consider possible typos, "PILGRIM" doesn't have the letters E, E, N in sequence. Also, there's no numeric part like "1-125" in the OCR output. 

Since the OCR output has no matching words from the ground truth, even considering typos and ignoring order, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There are no matches for the unique ground truth words.
