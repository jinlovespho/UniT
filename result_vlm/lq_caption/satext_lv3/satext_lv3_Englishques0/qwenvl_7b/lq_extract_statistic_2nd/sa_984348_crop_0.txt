gt_text: Instagram
vlm_output: Instagram

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "Instagram" and the VLM OCR output is also "Instagram". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Instagram".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Instagram". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the guidelines mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Small typos would still count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
