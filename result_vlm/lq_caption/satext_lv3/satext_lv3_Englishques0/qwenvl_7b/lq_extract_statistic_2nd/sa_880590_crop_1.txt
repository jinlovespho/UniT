Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "6214" and the VLM OCR output is also "6214". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just the number 6214.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "6214". The OCR output has the same exact text. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one unique word, and the OCR output matches exactly, this should be category 1. The other considerations like capitalization, punctuation, and spaces don't apply here because there are no letters or punctuation. Also, there are no typos since they are the same. So the answer should be 1.
