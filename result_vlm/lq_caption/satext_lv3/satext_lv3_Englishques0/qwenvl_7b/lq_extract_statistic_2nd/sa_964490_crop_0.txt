gt_text: ZONE CO2 EMISSION LOW
vlm_output: CO2 ZONE

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "ZONE CO2 EMISSION LOW". The unique words here are "ZONE", "CO2", "EMISSION", and "LOW". The OCR output is "CO2 ZONE". Let's break down the steps as outlined.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's "CO2 ZONE".

Step 2: Compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified factors. Let's go through each factor:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check which of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "CO2 ZONE", which is all caps, but the ground truth has "ZONE" and "CO2" in caps as well. So case doesn't matter here. Also, there's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about in this case.
- Small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output has "CO2" and "ZONE", which are exactly as in the ground truth.

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are "ZONE", "CO2", "EMISSION", "LOW". The OCR output has "CO2" and "ZONE". So two of the four unique words match. The other two, "EMISSION" and "LOW", are missing.

Looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, only two out of four are present, so this is not the case.

2 — Slightly correct (partially correct): At least one but not all unique words match. Since two words match, this would fall into category 2.

3 — Incorrect: No words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since two words do match, this isn't the case.

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 192
2. Slightly Correct Num: 100
3. Incorrect Num: 507
