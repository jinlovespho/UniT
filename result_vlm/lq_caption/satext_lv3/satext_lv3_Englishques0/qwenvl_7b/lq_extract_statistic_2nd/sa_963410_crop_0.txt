Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Orange" and the VLM OCR output is also "Orange". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "Orange", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Orange". The OCR output also has "Orange". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. There's no punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're exactly the same.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's a Category 1. There's no partial match or anything else. So the answer should be 1.
