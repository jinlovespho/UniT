gt_text: Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM
vlm_output: 2

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM" and the VLM OCR output is just "2". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just the number 2. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has several words: Platform, Lumpur, Kuala, 2, SKTM. The OCR output only has "2". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos are considered matches. But here, the OCR output only has the number 2. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But the OCR output only has one word, which is "2". The ground truth has five unique words. So clearly, not all are present. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all match. The OCR output has "2", which is present in the ground truth. So that's one match. The rest (Platform, Lumpur, Kuala, SKTM) are not present. So this would be category 2. 

Category 3 is if no words match or it's unrelated. But since "2" is a match, it's not category 3. 

So the answer should be 2.
