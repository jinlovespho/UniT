gt_text: JBL SONY
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "JBL SONY". The OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has two words: JBL and SONY. But the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. However, "100%" doesn't contain either JBL or SONY. Even if we ignore capitalization and typos, there's no match here. The OCR output is completely different. 

So, since none of the words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it should be category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any of the required words.
