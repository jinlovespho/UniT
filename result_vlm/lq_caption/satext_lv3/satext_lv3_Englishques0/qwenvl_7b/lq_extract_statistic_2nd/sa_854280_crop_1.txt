gt_text: TROPEZ SAINT
vlm_output: SAINT TROPEZ

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TROPEZ SAINT" and the OCR output is "SAINT TROPEZ". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "SAINT TROPEZ".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed in the OCR output, that shouldn't affect the comparison. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "TROPEZ" and "SAINT". The OCR output has "SAINT" and "TROPEZ". Both words are present, just in reverse order. The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, so "SAINT" in the OCR matches "SAINT" in the ground truth, and "TROPEZ" matches as well. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos mentioned, so both words are exact matches.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct. The key points here are that the words are present, order doesn't matter, and there are no typos or missing words.
