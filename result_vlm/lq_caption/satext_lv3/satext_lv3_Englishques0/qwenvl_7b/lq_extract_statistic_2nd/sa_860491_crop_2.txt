gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "POLIZEI".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. The next point says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POLIZEI". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. So that's fine. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's fully correct.
