gt_text: CERVECERI
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CERVECERI" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "CERVECERI", which seems to be a Spanish word for "brewery" or something similar.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CERVECERI". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the OCR output contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. However, "10%" doesn't contain "CERVECERI" in any form. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "10%" is entirely different. There's no overlap in words here. 

Small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just a completely different type of content. The OCR output is a number, while the ground truth is a word. So, there are no matching words. 

Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated, the answer should be 3.
