gt_text: RESTAURANT TREILLE LA
vlm_output: 1975

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "RESTAURANT TREILLE LA". The OCR output is "1975". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "1975". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has the words "RESTAURANT", "TREILLE", and "LA". The OCR output is numbers, not words. So, none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The instructions say to consider word order not mattering, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is entirely numbers, which don't match any of the words in the ground truth. Even if there were typos, "1975" doesn't resemble any of the words. 

Since there are no matching words, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no overlap in the unique words, and the output is unrelated.
