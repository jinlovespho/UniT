gt_text: LOVE
vlm_output: 1980

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LOVE" and the VLM OCR output is "1980". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "1980". Now, the ground truth is "LOVE". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "LOVE" is one word, the unique words are just "LOVE".

Next, check if "LOVE" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output is "1980", which is numbers. There's no "LOVE" in there. The steps mention that small typos still count as matches, but here it's not even close. The words are completely different. Also, ignoring case and punctuation, but "1980" doesn't have any letters. So there's no match. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
