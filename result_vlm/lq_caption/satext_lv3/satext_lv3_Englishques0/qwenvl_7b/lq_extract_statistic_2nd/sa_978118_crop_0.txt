gt_text: TAKST BYGGKONTROLL
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TAKST BYGGKONTROLL" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number. Now, comparing this with the ground truth, which has two words: "TAKST" and "BYGGKONTROLL". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not a word. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "100" is a numeral, not a word. Also, typos are considered matches if they are small, but "100" doesn't resemble either "TAKST" or "BYGGKONTROLL" even with typos. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering the allowed variations, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match at all. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any of the required words.
