gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "LIBERTE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The next point is to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LIBERTE". The OCR output also has "LIBERTE". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are all caps, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. The answer should be 1.
