gt_text: EMBRAER LND 195 SP
vlm_output: SOUTHWEST

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMBRAER LND 195 SP" and the OCR output is "SOUTHWEST". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "SOUTHWEST".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: EMBRAER, LND, 195, SP. Let's note that these are four unique words. The OCR output is a single word: SOUTHWEST.

Now, considering the comparison rules. The problem states that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. But I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

Looking at the OCR word "SOUTHWEST" versus the ground truth words. Let's check each:

- EMBRAER: No match. SOUTHWEST doesn't contain EMBRAER or any variation.
- LND: No match. LND is a three-letter code, not present in SOUTHWEST.
- 195: Numerical, but the OCR output is all letters. No match.
- SP: Again, letters but not part of SOUTHWEST.

So none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is a completely different word that doesn't contain any of the expected terms. Even if we consider typos, "SOUTHWEST" isn't a typo for any of the ground truth words. Therefore, there's no match.

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
