gt_text: FABBRI PIAZZETTA
vlm_output: 1046

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FABBRI PIAZZETTA" and the VLM OCR output is "1046". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1046", which is a number. The ground truth is two words: "FABBRI" and "PIAZZETTA". 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "1046", which are digits, not words. The ground truth words are proper nouns, likely names. 

The OCR output doesn't have any letters, just numbers. So, there's no overlap in words between the OCR output and the ground truth. Even if we consider typos or case, the OCR output is entirely numeric, which doesn't match the alphabetic words in the ground truth. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 146
2. Slightly Correct Num: 70
3. Incorrect Num: 375
