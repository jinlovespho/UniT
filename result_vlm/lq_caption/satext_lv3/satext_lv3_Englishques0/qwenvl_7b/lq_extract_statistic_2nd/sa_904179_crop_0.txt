gt_text: STUDENT CENTER
vlm_output: STUDENT CENTER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STUDENT CENTER" and the VLM OCR output is also "STUDENT CENTER". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are identical, so order is the same. Then, we need to check based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "STUDENT" and "CENTER". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Both are all caps, but even if they weren't, the comparison is case-insensitive. There's no punctuation here, and the spacing is the same. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and everything matches. No issues here. The answer should be 1.
