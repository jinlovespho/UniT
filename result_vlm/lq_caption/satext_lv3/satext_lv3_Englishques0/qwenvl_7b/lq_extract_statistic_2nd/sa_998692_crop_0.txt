Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "86346" and the VLM OCR output is also "86346". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "86346", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are just a single number. So the order is the same, but even if it weren't, since it's only one "word" (if we consider numbers as words here), the order wouldn't affect anything. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "86346". The OCR output also has "86346". So the set of unique words in the OCR output matches exactly with the ground truth. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But there's no capitalization here, no punctuation, and no spaces. So nothing to adjust for. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (which they are), it's category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
