Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is also "105". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "105".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "105". The OCR output also has "105", so they match exactly. 

The guidelines say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since there are no letters here, capitalization isn't a factor. There's no punctuation or spaces either. Also, the note about small typos still counting as matches—though there are no typos in this case.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. That means it's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
