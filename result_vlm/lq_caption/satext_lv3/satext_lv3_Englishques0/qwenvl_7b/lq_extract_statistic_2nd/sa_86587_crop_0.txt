gt_text: BAR RESTAURANT WILFS
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "BAR RESTAURANT WILFS" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "BAR", "RESTAURANT", and "WILFS". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The words "BAR", "RESTAURANT", and "WILFS" aren't in "100%". 

Also, considering that the OCR output is a percentage, which is unrelated to the restaurant name. The categories say that if no words match or the output is unrelated, it's category 3. Since there's no overlap in words and the output is completely different, the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 60
2. Slightly Correct Num: 25
3. Incorrect Num: 145
