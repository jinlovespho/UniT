gt_text: AMSTEL AMSTEL
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMSTEL AMSTEL", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, moving to Step 2, we need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth based on specific criteria.

The ground truth has the words "AMSTEL" repeated twice. But since the comparison considers unique words, we only need to check if "AMSTEL" is present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're only comparing unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "AMSTEL". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word "AMSTEL". 

Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "AMSTEL" in any way. The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no similarity. Also, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth text.
