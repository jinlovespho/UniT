gt_text: Phoenix Hotel
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "Phoenix Hotel" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just a percentage. Then step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The rules for comparison are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "Phoenix" and "Hotel". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage sign. Let's see if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "Phoenix" and "Hotel" are both proper nouns, and the OCR output is just "10%", which doesn't have either of those words. There's no mention of numbers or percentages in the ground truth. 

So, since neither "Phoenix" nor "Hotel" are in the OCR output, there are no matches. According to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong. The OCR output here is completely unrelated to the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
