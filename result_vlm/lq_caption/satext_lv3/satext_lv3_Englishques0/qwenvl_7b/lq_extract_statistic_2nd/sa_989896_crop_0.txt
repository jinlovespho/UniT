gt_text: RATOWNICTWO DROGOWE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RATOWNICTWO DROGOWE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, the words are "RATOWNICTWO" and "DROGOWE". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The challenge here is whether "100%" can be considered as matching any of the words in the ground truth. 

The key points to consider: 
- The ground truth words are Polish, and "RATOWNICTWO DROGOWE" translates to "Road Rescue" in English. The OCR output is "100%", which is a numerical value, not related to the words in the ground truth. 
- Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos or ignoring case, there's no overlap. 
- The OCR output is a percentage, which is unrelated to the actual text. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. Here, none are present.
- Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words. Since none match, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is for no words matching or the output being largely wrong. This fits because the OCR output is completely unrelated.

So the answer should be category 3.
