gt_text: POLKA Gessler Magda
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLKA Gessler Magda" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. There are no letters here, so the extracted text is "100".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "POLKA", "Gessler", and "Magda". The OCR output has none of these words. The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not any of the words in the ground truth.

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth. However, in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words. Also, the rules mention that small typos are considered matches, but here there are no letters at all. So, there's no match.

The categories are: 1 if all words are present, 2 if at least one is present but not all, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no words matching the ground truth, it falls under category 3. Even though the OCR output isn't empty, it's unrelated as it's numbers instead of the expected names.
