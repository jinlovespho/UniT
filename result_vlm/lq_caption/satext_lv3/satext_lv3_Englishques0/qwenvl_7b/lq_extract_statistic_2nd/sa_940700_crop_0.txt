gt_text: OYO
vlm_output: OYO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OYO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OYO".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same. Also, they mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OYO". The OCR output also has "OYO", so that's a match. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here. The note about small typos still counting as matches is probably not relevant here since there are no typos.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the category should be 1.
