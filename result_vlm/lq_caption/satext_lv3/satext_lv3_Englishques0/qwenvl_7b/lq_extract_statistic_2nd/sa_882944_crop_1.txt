gt_text: SPORTAGE
vlm_output: SPORTAGE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPORTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "SPORTAGE".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SPORTAGE". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Typos are considered as matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
