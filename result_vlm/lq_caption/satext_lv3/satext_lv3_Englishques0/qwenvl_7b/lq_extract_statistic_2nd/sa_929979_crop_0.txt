gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: SCANIA

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "SCANIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "SCANIA". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "SCANIA", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but here both texts are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SCANIA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring order (though there's only one word here), case (both are uppercase), spacing (no spaces), and typos. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, there are no typos. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. So the answer should be 1.
