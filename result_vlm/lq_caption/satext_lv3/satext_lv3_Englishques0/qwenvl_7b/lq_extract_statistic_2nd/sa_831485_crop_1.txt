gt_text: SOPHIA PPALI
vlm_output: WELCOME

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SOPHIA PPALI" and the OCR output is "WELCOME". The task is to compare these two according to the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done here as "WELCOME". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SOPHIA" and "PPALI". 

Now, the OCR output is "WELCOME", which is a single word. Let's check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR word is "WELCOME", which doesn't match "SOPHIA" or "PPALI" even when considering typos, capitalization, or spacing. The ground truth words are not present in the OCR output. 

Since the OCR output has no matching words, according to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. Even if there were a typo, like if the OCR had "sophia" or something similar, but here it's "WELCOME" which is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
