gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CODE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering the specified factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "CODE". Let's break down the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage symbol. The words here are "100" and "%". The ground truth's unique word is "CODE". Now, checking if any of the OCR words match. "100" is a number, and "%" is a symbol. Neither of these are related to "CODE". There's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "CODE" in any way. The OCR output is entirely different from the ground truth. 

Since there are no matching words, even partially, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. There's no mention of any letters in the OCR output that could be considered a typo for "CODE". The numbers and symbol don't align with the expected word. Therefore, the answer is category 3.
