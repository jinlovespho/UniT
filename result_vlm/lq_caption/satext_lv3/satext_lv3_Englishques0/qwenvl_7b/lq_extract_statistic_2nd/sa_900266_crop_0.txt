gt_text: CHINA EASTERN EASTERN
vlm_output: CHINA EASTERN

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHINA EASTERN EASTERN" and the VLM OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "CHINA EASTERN". 

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has the words "CHINA" and "EASTERN" (even though "EASTERN" is repeated, we consider unique words). The OCR output has "CHINA" and "EASTERN" as well. 

Now, checking the criteria: unique words in the ground truth are "CHINA" and "EASTERN". The OCR output includes both of these words. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here, so that's fine. There are no typos mentioned, and the spacing is the same. Even if there were a typo, the note says small typos still count as matches. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the OCR output has one fewer instance of "EASTERN", the category should be 1—Correct. The repetition in the ground truth doesn't affect the unique set comparison. So the answer is category 1.
