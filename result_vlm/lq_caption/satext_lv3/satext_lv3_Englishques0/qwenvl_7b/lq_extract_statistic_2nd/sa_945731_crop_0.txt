gt_text: Richards St.
vlm_output: W 4th St

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Richards St." and the VLM OCR output is "W 4th St". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "W 4th St". So that's straightforward—just the words "W", "4th", and "St".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Richards St." So the unique words here are "Richards" and "St." (though "St." might be considered as "St" without the period, depending on how we handle punctuation).

The comparison rules are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, let's break down the ground truth words: "Richards" and "St." (or "St"). The OCR output has "W", "4th", and "St".

Now, checking for matches. The ground truth has "St" which is present in the OCR output. However, "Richards" is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "W" and "4th" which are not part of the ground truth. 

But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we only care if the OCR output contains the words from the ground truth, regardless of other words. The ground truth has "Richards" and "St". The OCR output has "St" (which matches "St" in the ground truth, ignoring the period), but not "Richards". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "Richards" and "St". The OCR output has "St" but not "Richards". So only one of the two unique words from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one is present, so not category 1.
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match. Since one matches, this would be category 2.
- Category 3: No words match or it's unrelated. But here, "St" does match, so not category 3.

Wait, but the ground truth has "Richards St." and the OCR has "W 4th St". The "St" is a match. However, "Richards" is not present. So only one of the two required words is present. Therefore, the answer should be category 2—partially correct.
