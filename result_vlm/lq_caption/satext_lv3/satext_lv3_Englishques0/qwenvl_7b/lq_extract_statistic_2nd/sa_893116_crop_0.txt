gt_text: ENTRANCE FERRY EXIT FOR BOARDING STEPS WESTERN
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to determine the category of the OCR output compared to the ground truth text. The ground truth is "ENTRANCE FERRY EXIT FOR BOARDING STEPS WESTERN" and the OCR output is "100%".

First, I need to follow the steps they outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos are okay. But the OCR output here is "100%", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth.

The ground truth has the words: ENTRANCE, FERRY, EXIT, FOR, BOARDING, STEPS, WESTERN. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. None of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if I consider "100%" as a number, it's not matching any of the words. Also, the output is completely unrelated to the ground truth. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but not all. But here, there are zero matches. So it would fall under Category 3: Incorrect. The output is not related, and there's no matching words. Even if I consider typos, but "100%" isn't a typo of any of the words. It's just a completely different thing. So the answer should be 3.
