gt_text: RYANAIR KI
vlm_output: Ryanair

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RYANAIR KI" and the OCR output is "Ryanair". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's "Ryanair". Then compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "RYANAIR" and "KI". But the OCR output has only one word: "Ryanair".

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore that. We need to check if the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The unique words in the ground truth are "RYANAIR" and "KI". 

Looking at the OCR output, "Ryanair" is a variation of "RYANAIR" (case-insensitive and possibly a typo, but the rules say small typos still count as matches). So "Ryanair" matches "RYANAIR". However, "KI" is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output only has "Ryanair", so the second word "KI" is missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Here, only one of the two words matches. So that's category 2.
