gt_text: LG
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LG" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. Now, step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "LG". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LG". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

But wait, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100%" has numbers and a percentage symbol, which are not present in "LG". Also, the category definitions say that category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "LG" isn't in "100%", there's no match. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output. So that's not category 2. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain "LG" and they are unrelated (LG is a company name, 100% is a percentage), this would be category 3. 

I need to make sure there's no typo consideration here. The OCR output is "100%", which is not a typo of "LG". Even if there was a typo, like "100" instead of "LG", but "100" isn't close to "LG" in terms of letters. So no match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
