gt_text: PINLOCK
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "PINLOCK" and the OCR output is "100%". So, first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "PINLOCK". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. Now, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But "100%" has a percentage sign, which is punctuation. However, the ground truth is a word, not a number. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since "PINLOCK" is a word and the OCR output is "100%", there's no overlap in words. Even if we ignore punctuation, "100" is a number, not the word "PINLOCK". Also, typos are considered matches if they are small, but here it's not a typo, it's a completely different word. So there are no matching words. Therefore, the category should be 3.
