gt_text: 3 4
vlm_output: SUNSCREEN

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "3 4". The VLM OCR output is "SUNSCREEN".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just "SUNSCREEN".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the numbers 3 and 4. But the OCR output has the word "SUNSCREEN".

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "3" and "4". The OCR output has "SUNSCREEN".

Wait, but the ground truth words are numbers, and the OCR output is a word. So none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but the words themselves need to match. Since "SUNSCREEN" isn't "3" or "4", even considering typos, there's no match. So the category would be 3 — Incorrect, because no words match.
