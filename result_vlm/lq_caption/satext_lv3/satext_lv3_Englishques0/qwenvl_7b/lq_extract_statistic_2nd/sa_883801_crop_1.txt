gt_text: MIRA EKONOMI
vlm_output: VIVA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MIRA EKONOMI" and the VLM OCR output is "VIVA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "VIVA". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "VIVA", which is a single word. Let me check for possible matches. "VIVA" doesn't look like "MIRA" or "EKONOMI". Even if I consider typos, "VIVA" is quite different from both. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none. Since "VIVA" doesn't match either "MIRA" or "EKONOMI", even with typos, there are no matches. So the answer should be 3.
