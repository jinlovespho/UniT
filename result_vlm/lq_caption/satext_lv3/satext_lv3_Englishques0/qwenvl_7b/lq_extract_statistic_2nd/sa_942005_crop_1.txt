Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "V10" and the VLM OCR output is also "V10". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "V10", that's straightforward. Then Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, both are the same.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "V10". The OCR output also has "V10". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The other factors to consider are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, both texts are exactly the same, so those factors don't affect the comparison. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

Since all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
