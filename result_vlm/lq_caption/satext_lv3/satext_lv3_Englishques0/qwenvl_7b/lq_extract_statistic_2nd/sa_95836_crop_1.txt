gt_text: ROVER
vlm_output: ROVER

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROVER" and the VLM OCR output is also "ROVER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ROVER".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ROVER". The OCR output also has "ROVER". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because both are exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "ROVER" is present and matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
