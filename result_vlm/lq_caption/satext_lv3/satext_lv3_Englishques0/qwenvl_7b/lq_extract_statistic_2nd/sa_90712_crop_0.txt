gt_text: DIVING CLIMBING NO NO
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DIVING CLIMBING NO NO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine the category based on the comparison rules provided.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth words: "DIVING", "CLIMBING", "NO", and "NO" again. But since we're considering unique words, the ground truth has three unique words: "DIVING", "CLIMBING", and "NO".

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the OCR output "100%", there are no words that match any of the ground truth words. The OCR output is a numerical value, not any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider "NO" as a possible typo, "100%" doesn't resemble "NO" in any way. There's no mention of "DIVING" or "CLIMBING" either. Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
