gt_text: nike
vlm_output: nike

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "nike" and the VLM OCR output is also "nike". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "nike".

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "nike". The OCR output also has "nike". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same, so no issues there. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
