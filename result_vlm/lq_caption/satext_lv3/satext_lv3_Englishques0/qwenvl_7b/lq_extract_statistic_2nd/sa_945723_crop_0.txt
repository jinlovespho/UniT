gt_text: Rio del Casa
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Rio del Casa" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is "Rio del Casa". 

Looking at the categories, the key points are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has three words: "Rio", "del", "Casa". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. None of the words in the OCR output match any of the ground truth words. "10%" isn't a word that's part of the ground truth. There's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble any of the words in "Rio del Casa". 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match at all, and the output is unrelated.
