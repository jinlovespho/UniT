gt_text: SUPPLIES CB
vlm_output: CBSUPPLIES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SUPPLIES CB" and the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "CBSUPPLIES". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, I should consider unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SUPPLIES" and "CB". 

Looking at the OCR output, "CBSUPPLIES" seems to be a combination of "CB" and "SUPPLIES" but concatenated without a space. Since spaces are to be ignored, maybe "CBSUPPLIES" can be split into "CB" and "SUPPLIES". 

But wait, the OCR output is a single word. However, the ground truth has two words. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words: "SUPPLIES" and "CB". The OCR output has one word: "CBSUPPLIES". 

But the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered as having both "CB" and "SUPPLIES" even though they're combined. But how? If the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", can that be split into "CB" and "SUPPLIES"? If we split it into "CB" and "SUPPLIES", then both words are present. 

Also, capitalization is ignored. The ground truth has "SUPPLIES" and "CB" in uppercase, but the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES" which is all uppercase. So that's okay. 

So the OCR output contains both "CB" and "SUPPLIES" as parts of the string, even though they're not separated by a space. Since the instructions say to ignore spacing, maybe that's acceptable. Therefore, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

So the category would be 1 — Correct.
