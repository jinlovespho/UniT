Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EAO HY18" and the OCR output is "7601". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output is "7601", which is just numbers. The ground truth has "EAO" and "HY18", which are letters and numbers. 

Step 2 is comparing them. The rules say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "EAO" and "HY18". The OCR output has "7601", which is a single number. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But the OCR output has numbers, and the ground truth has letters and numbers. The problem is that "EAO" and "HY18" are not present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "7601", which doesn't match either of the ground truth words. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in the words. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. So, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since there's no match at all, it should be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe "HY18" could be misread as "7601"? Like, maybe the OCR made a mistake in reading the letters as numbers. But according to the rules, small typos count as matches. But "HY18" is letters and numbers, and the OCR output is all numbers. There's no overlapping letters here. "EAO" is all letters, which the OCR output doesn't have. So even if there's a typo, there's no way "7601" would be a typo of "EAO" or "HY18". 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. So the answer is category 3.
