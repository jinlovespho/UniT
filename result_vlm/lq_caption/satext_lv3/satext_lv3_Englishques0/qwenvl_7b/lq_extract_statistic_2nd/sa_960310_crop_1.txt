gt_text: next
vlm_output: next

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "next" and the VLM OCR output is also "next". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is just "next".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly the same word "next". 

The ground truth has one unique word: "next". The OCR output also has "next". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though there's only one word, it's a match. 

The categories are 1 if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's correct, this should be category 1. There's no case difference, no typos, and no missing words. So the answer is 1.
