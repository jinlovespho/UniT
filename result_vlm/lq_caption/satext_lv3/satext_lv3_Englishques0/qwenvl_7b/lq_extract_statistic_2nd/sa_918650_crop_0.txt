gt_text: AC MARRIOTT HOTELS TELS HO
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "AC MARRIOTT HOTELS TELS HO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two and categorize the result into 1, 2, or 3 based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth. The ground truth text is "AC MARRIOTT HOTELS TELS HO". Splitting this into individual words, we have: AC, MARRIOTT, HOTELS, TELS, HO. So the unique words here are those five. Now, the OCR output is "100%", which is a single word. 

Now, the question is whether any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. The words in the ground truth are all proper nouns or parts of hotel names. None of the words in the ground truth (AC, Marriott, Hotels, Tels, HO) are present in "100%". Even if we consider typos or variations, "100%" doesn't resemble any of those words. 

The criteria for category 1 is that all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, which isn't the case here. For category 2, at least one unique word must match. But since none of the words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, that doesn't apply. Therefore, the only possibility is category 3, which is incorrect because no words match, or the output is unrelated. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if any of the words could be a typo. For example, "100%" could be a typo for "100%", but that's not a word in the ground truth. The words in the ground truth are all proper nouns. So, no, there's no overlap. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
