gt_text: 251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION
vlm_output: 251

----------------------------

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION". The VLM OCR output is just "251". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward—it's "251". 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has the words: "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". Let's break them down. The OCR output is "251". 

Now, checking each unique word from the ground truth. The first word "251" is exactly present in the OCR output. The other words "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION" are not present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 
But here, only "251" matches. The rest are missing. 

So, since at least one but not all unique words match, that would be category 2—Slightly correct (partially correct). 

Wait, but the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth to be category 1. Since it's missing "DEPT", "OF", and "TRANSPORTATION", it's not category 1. But since at least one (251) is present, it's category 2. 

So the answer should be 2.
