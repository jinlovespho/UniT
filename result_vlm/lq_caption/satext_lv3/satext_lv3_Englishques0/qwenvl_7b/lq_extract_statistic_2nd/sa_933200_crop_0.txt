gt_text: CAS 4C
vlm_output: 1037

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CAS 4C" and the VLM OCR output is "1037". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given rules.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1037", which is just numbers. The ground truth has "CAS 4C", which includes letters and numbers.

Step 2 is comparing them. The rules say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the order. But I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "CAS" and "4C". Wait, but "4C" is a single word? Or is "4C" considered as two separate parts? Hmm, maybe "CAS" and "4C" are the two unique words here. 

Now, the OCR output is "1037". Let's break that down. The OCR output has the numbers 1, 0, 3, 7. But the ground truth has letters and numbers. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output doesn't have any letters. The ground truth words are "CAS" (which is all caps) and "4C" (a number and a letter). 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output has no letters at all. So "CAS" is letters, and "4C" has a number and a letter. The OCR output is all numbers. So none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no letters, neither "CAS" nor "4C" are present. So there are no matches. Therefore, it's category 3.
