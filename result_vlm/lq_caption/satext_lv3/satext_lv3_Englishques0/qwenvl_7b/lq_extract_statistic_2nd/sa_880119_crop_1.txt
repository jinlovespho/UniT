gt_text: KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON
vlm_output: KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON" and the VLM OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering the given criteria.

The key points for comparison are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

Let's break down the ground truth words. The ground truth has three words: "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", and "ON". The OCR output has the same three words: "KOMMUNISM", "ON", "VANGLA". 

Now, checking each word. All the words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The order is different, but since word order doesn't matter, that's okay. Also, there's no difference in the words themselves except for the order. The capitalization is the same in both, so no issues there. There are no typos mentioned here, so all words match exactly. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct.
