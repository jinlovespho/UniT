gt_text: New 2015 All
vlm_output: FIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "New 2015 All" and the VLM OCR output is "FIT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "FIT". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has three words: New, 2015, All. The OCR output has one word: FIT. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in ground truth. Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Also, small typos count as matches. 

But "FIT" doesn't seem to relate to any of the words in the ground truth. New, 2015, All. Even if we ignore case, "Fit" isn't matching any of those. There's no overlap. 

So, the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match, or it's unrelated. The output is "FIT" which is unrelated to the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
