gt_text: ALEXELA
vlm_output: ALEXELA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ALEXELA" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALEXELA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "ALEXELA", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But wait, both texts are the same, so order is the same here. Also, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is one word: "ALEXELA". The OCR output is the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are all caps and no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has that same word. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

No issues here. The answer should be 1.
