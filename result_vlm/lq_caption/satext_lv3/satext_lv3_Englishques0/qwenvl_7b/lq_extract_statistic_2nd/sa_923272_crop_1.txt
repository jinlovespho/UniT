gt_text: BOSS HUGO BOSS
vlm_output: BOSS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BOSS HUGO BOSS" and the VLM OCR output is "BOSS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "BOSS". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "BOSS" and "HUGO". But the OCR output only has "BOSS". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "BOSS" and "HUGO". The OCR output has "BOSS" but not "HUGO". 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the two is present. So that's not Category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since "BOSS" is present, but "HUGO" is missing, that fits Category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. But here, "BOSS" does match, so it's not Category 3. 

Wait, but the OCR output is just "BOSS". The ground truth has "BOSS" twice, but the unique words are still just "BOSS" and "HUGO". So the OCR output has one of the two unique words. So that's partial. Therefore, the answer should be 2.
