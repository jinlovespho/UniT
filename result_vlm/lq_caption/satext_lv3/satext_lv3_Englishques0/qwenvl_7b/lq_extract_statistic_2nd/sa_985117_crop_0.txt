Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Ratskeller" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is just numbers. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Ratskeller", which is a word, probably a proper noun like a place name. Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is "1970", which is a year, not a word. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Ratskeller". The OCR output has "1970", which is a number. Since there's no overlap in words (numbers vs. letters), there are no matching words. Even if I consider typos, "1970" doesn't resemble "Ratskeller" in any way. So, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. 

I think the answer is 3 because there's no match between the OCR output and the ground truth words.
