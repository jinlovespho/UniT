gt_text: BOTTEGA VENETA
vlm_output: BOTTEGA VENETA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BOTTEGA VENETA" and the VLM OCR output is the same. So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BOTTEGA" and "VENETA". The OCR output has the same two words. 

We have to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here, so no issue. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored. The OCR output doesn't have any extra spaces or punctuation. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means it's category 1. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the words are correct. Even if there were minor typos, like "BOTTEGA" vs "BOTTEGA" (which is the same), it's still a match. Since everything matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
