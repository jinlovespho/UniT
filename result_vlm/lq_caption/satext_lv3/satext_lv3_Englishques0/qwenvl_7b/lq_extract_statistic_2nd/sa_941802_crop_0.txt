gt_text: CHUNCHEON TOURIST GIDE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CHUNCHEON TOURIST GIDE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "CHUNCHEON" and "TOURIST GIDE". Wait, actually, "TOURIST GIDE" is one word? Or is "GIDE" a typo for "GUIDE"? But the problem says to ignore typos, so maybe "GIDE" is considered a match for "GUIDE"?

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of those words. The ground truth words are "CHUNCHEON", "TOURIST", and "GIDE" (assuming "GIDE" is a typo for "GUIDE"). However, the OCR output has none of these words. It's just "100%", which is a percentage. So there's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has none of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos and ignoring case, the answer should be category 3.
