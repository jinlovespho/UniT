gt_text: EXIT
vlm_output: 1

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "EXIT" and the VLM OCR output is "1". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "EXIT". The OCR output is "1". Let me break down the comparison. The ground truth's unique words are just "EXIT". The OCR output is "1", which is a number, not a word. Now, considering the criteria, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. Since "1" is not a word (it's a numeral) and doesn't match "EXIT" even with typos, there's no overlap. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth's unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one but not all match (but there are no matches here), and 3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1" is unrelated to "EXIT" and doesn't contain any of the required words, this should be category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's entirely incorrect. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 48
2. Slightly Correct Num: 22
3. Incorrect Num: 113
