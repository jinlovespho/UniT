gt_text: ALSTOM
vlm_output: ALSTOM

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "ALSTOM" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALSTOM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "ALSTOM", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same single word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "ALSTOM". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there are none. There's no typo mentioned, so "ALSTOM" matches exactly. 

Since all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
