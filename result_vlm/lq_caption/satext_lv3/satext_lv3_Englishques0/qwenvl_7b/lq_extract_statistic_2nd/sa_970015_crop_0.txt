gt_text: APL COSCO
vlm_output: APL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APL COSCO" and the VLM OCR output is "APL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "APL".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has two unique words: "APL" and "COSCO". The OCR output has only "APL". 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. "APL" is present, but "COSCO" is missing. Since the category 1 requires all unique words to be present, this isn't met. 

Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words matching. Here, one word ("APL") matches, and one ("COSCO") doesn't. So that fits category 2. 

Category 3 would be if no words matched or the output was unrelated. Since "APL" is a match, it's not category 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
