gt_text: MULTIPLEX
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MULTIPLEX" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MULTIPLEX", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100", which is a number. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the OCR output here is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a word, so the OCR output doesn't have any words that match. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since "100" is a number and doesn't contain the word "MULTIPLEX" or any of its variations (like ignoring case, etc.), there's no match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3 because there's no match and the output is unrelated.
