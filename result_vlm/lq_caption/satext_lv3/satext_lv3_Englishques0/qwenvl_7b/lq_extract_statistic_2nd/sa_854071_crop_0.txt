gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has "NANTES". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's the same. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So the category should be 1 because all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There's only one word, and it's a perfect match. So the answer is 1.
