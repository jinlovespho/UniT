gt_text: in
vlm_output: in

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "in", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are just "in", so order isn't an issue.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both texts are lowercase, have no punctuation, and only one word. There's no extra or missing spaces here. Also, there are no typos since both are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that means it's Category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
