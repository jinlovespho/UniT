Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "214" and the VLM OCR output is also "214". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "214", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both texts are exactly the same: "214".

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is a single number, "214". Since there's only one word, the unique set is just {"214"}. The OCR output also has the same single word. 

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there are no capital letters, punctuation, or spaces to consider. The OCR output matches exactly, so there's no issue with typos either. 

The categories are defined as follows:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match.
- Category 3: No words match or the output is wrong/unrelated/empty.

Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, all unique words (just one) are present. Therefore, this should fall under Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The answer should be 1.
