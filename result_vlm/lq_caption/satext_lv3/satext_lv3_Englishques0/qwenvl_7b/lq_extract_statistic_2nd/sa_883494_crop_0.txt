gt_text: JOAN RED
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "JOAN RED". The VLM OCR output is "100%". So I need to compare these two.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just the percentage symbol and numbers. 

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "JOAN" and "RED". The OCR output has "100%", which is numbers and a percent sign. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "JOAN" and "RED" are names and colors, while "100%" is a numerical value. There's no overlap in the words here. 

Also, considering that we ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "100%" doesn't contain any of the words "joan" or "red". Even if we consider typos, there's nothing close. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of content. 

So according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it should be category 3: Incorrect.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 87
2. Slightly Correct Num: 32
3. Incorrect Num: 203
