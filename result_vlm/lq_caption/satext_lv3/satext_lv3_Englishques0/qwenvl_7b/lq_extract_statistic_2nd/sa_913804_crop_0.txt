gt_text: GOVERNO DEL AZZO PAL PALAZZO
vlm_output: 1972

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GOVERNO DEL AZZO PAL PALAZZO". The OCR output is "1972". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just the number 1972. Then, compare that with the ground truth.

The ground truth has words: GOVERNO, DEL, AZZO, PAL, PALAZZO. Let's consider them as a set of unique words. The OCR output is "1972", which is numbers, not words. So none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output has no words matching. Also, the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there were typos, but here the OCR output is numbers, which are not words from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
