gt_text: AH
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AH" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "AH". The OCR output has "100%". Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the ground truth is "AH" which is two letters, and the OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a percentage sign.

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "AH" is one unique word. The OCR output's unique words are "100%". Now, the question is whether "100%" contains any of the ground truth words. But "AH" isn't present in "100%", even if we ignore case and punctuation. The OCR output has numbers and a percentage, which don't match the letters in "AH". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no overlap between "AH" and "100%", the answer should be category 3. Even though there's a typo consideration, but "100%" doesn't contain "AH" or any variation of it. So the OCR output is unrelated and incorrect.
