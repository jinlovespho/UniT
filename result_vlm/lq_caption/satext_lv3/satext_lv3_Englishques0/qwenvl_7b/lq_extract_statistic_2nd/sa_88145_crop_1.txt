gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: HSBC

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HSBC", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "HSBC" (since it's a single word). The OCR output also has "HSBC", so all unique words from the ground truth are present. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue here. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. There are no typos either because they're the same.

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1.
