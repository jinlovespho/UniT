gt_text: pwc ABB
vlm_output: SUNRISE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "pwc ABB" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNRISE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "SUNRISE". 

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has two unique words: "pwc" and "ABB". The OCR output is "SUNRISE", which is a single word. 

Now, checking if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "pwc" and "ABB" are not present in "SUNRISE". Also, considering case insensitivity, "SUNRISE" doesn't match "pwc" or "ABB" even if we ignore case. 

The OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique words. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Even if there were typos, but in this case, the words are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
