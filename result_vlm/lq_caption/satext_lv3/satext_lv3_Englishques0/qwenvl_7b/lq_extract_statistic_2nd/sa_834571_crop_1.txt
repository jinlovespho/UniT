gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: SOLD

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SOLD" and the VLM OCR output is also "SOLD". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are exactly the same word.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SOLD". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1, which is correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
