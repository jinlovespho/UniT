gt_text: Edelweiss Edelweiss Edelweiss Edelweiss RESTORAN
vlm_output: Café

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Edelweiss Edelweiss Edelweiss Edelweiss RESTORAN". So the unique words here are "Edelweiss" and "RESTORAN". The VLM OCR output is "Café".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "Café". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Edelweiss" and "RESTORAN".

Now, the OCR output is "Café". Let's check if any of the ground truth words are present. "Café" doesn't match "Edelweiss" or "RESTORAN". Even if I consider typos, "Café" isn't a typo of either. Also, ignoring capitalization, "RESTORAN" is all caps, but "Café" is lowercase. No match there. So the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
