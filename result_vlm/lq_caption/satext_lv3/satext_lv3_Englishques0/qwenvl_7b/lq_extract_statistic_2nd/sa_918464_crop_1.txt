Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Epsom" and the VLM OCR output is also "Epsom". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Epsom".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one word: "Epsom". The OCR output is the same word. So when we compare, since they are identical, all unique words (which is just "Epsom") are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a match, the answer should be 1. There's no issue here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Even if there were minor typos, like "Epsom" vs "Epsom" (but they are the same here), it's still considered a match. So the category is definitely 1.
