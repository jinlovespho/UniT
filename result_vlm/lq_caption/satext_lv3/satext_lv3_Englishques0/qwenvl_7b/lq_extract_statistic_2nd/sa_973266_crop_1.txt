gt_text: HUBERT
vlm_output: 1000

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "HUBERT" and the VLM OCR output is "1000". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1000", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "HUBERT", which is a name, probably a person's name.

Now, step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "HUBERT" since it's a single word. The OCR output is "1000", which is a number. 

The instructions mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "HUBERT". The OCR output has "1000", which is not a word but a number. However, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "1000" isn't a word, so maybe it's not matching. Also, typos are considered matches, but "1000" doesn't look like a typo of "HUBERT". 

So, the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique words. The category 3 says "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since "1000" is unrelated to "HUBERT" and there's no matching word, this should be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if there's any possible overlap. For example, if the OCR output had letters that could be mistaken for the ground truth. But "1000" is all numbers. The ground truth is all letters. So there's no overlap. Therefore, no words match, so category 3.
