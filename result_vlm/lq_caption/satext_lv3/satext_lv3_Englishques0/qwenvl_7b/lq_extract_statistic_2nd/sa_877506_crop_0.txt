gt_text: BiZ
vlm_output: BiZ

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BiZ" and the VLM OCR output is also "BiZ". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "BiZ" (assuming it's one word, maybe a typo for "Biz" or something else, but the problem says to ignore typos). Wait, the ground truth is "BiZ" and the OCR output is "BiZ" exactly. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"BiZ"}, and the OCR output has the same. 

Considering that the comparison is based on the set of unique words, and since they are identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. Even if there were a typo, like "Biz" vs "BiZ", it would still be considered a match. But here, there's no typo; they are the same. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no mention of any missing words or partial matches here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match under the given criteria.
