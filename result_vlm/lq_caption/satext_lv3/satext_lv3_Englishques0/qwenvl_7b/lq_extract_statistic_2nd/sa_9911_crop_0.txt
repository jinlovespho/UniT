gt_text: ZURICH
vlm_output: 1855

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "ZURICH" and the VLM OCR output is "1855". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "1855", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "ZURICH". 

Moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter. But the key points here are comparing the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ZURICH". The OCR output is "1855", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output doesn't contain any words from the ground truth, even if we ignore case, punctuation, spacing, etc., there's no match. The OCR output is numbers, which aren't words, so they can't match "ZURICH" even with typos considered. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. 
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all match. 
3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated.

Since "1855" has no words from the ground truth, it's category 3. Even though there's a possibility that numbers might be part of a different context, the problem specifies comparing unique words. The OCR output isn't a word, so it doesn't match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 230
2. Slightly Correct Num: 114
3. Incorrect Num: 602
