gt_text: FedEx Express
vlm_output: FedEx

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FedEx Express" and the VLM OCR output is "FedEx". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "FedEx". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "FedEx" and "Express". 

Now, the OCR output has "FedEx" which matches exactly with one of the ground truth words. The other word in the ground truth is "Express", which isn't present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has one of the two words, that would be category 2. Even though there's a typo, the problem says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo here. The OCR output is missing "Express" entirely. So, only one word matches. Therefore, category 2 is the right answer.
