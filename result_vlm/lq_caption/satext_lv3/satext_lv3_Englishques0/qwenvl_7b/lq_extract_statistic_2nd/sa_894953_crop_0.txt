gt_text: 52093 mobile
vlm_output: 52093

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "52093 mobile" and the VLM OCR output is "52093". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "52093", which is a number. The ground truth has two parts: the number "52093" and the word "mobile".

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output only has "52093". 

But wait, the problem mentions comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has "52093" but not "mobile". So, only one of the two unique words is present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Since the OCR output has one correct word but misses "mobile", that would fall into category 2. 

But wait, the OCR output is "52093" which is exactly the first part of the ground truth. However, the second part "mobile" is missing. Since the ground truth has two unique words, and the OCR only has one, it's partially correct. So category 2.
