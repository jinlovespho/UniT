gt_text: Bell
vlm_output: Bell

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bell" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bell". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Bell", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are just "Bell". 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bell". The OCR output also has "Bell". So they match exactly. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization. But both are capitalized the same here. Punctuation and spaces—there's none here. Typos are mentioned, but since they are the same, there's no typo. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches, the answer should be 1.
