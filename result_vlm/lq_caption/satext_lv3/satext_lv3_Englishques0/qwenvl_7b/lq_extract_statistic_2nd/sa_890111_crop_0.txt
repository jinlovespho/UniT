gt_text: GUINNESS
vlm_output: 100%

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GUINNESS" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "GUINNESS", which is a brand name.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring word order, case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is a single word, "GUINNESS".

So, considering the unique words in the ground truth, there's only one word: "GUINNESS". The OCR output has "100%", which doesn't contain the word "GUINNESS" or any variation of it. Even if we ignore case, "100%" doesn't match "guinness" or any part of it. There's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no match here, the category should be 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. Even though "100%" might be a number, it doesn't relate to the word "GUINNESS". So the answer is 3.
