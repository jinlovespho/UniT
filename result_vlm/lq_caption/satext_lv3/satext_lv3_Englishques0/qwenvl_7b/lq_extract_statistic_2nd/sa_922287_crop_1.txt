gt_text: AMBULANCE 13-110
vlm_output: CAPITALBUS

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMBULANCE 13-110" and the VLM OCR output is "CAPITALBUS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "CAPITALBUS". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "AMBULANCE" and "13-110". The OCR output is "CAPITALBUS". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "AMBULANCE" and "13-110". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. Let's look at "CAPITALBUS" versus "AMBULANCE" and "13-110".

"AMBULANCE" vs "CAPITALBUS": These are different words. No letters match in the same order. Even if we ignore case, "ambulance" vs "capitalbus" – they don't share any common words. 

"13-110" is a number with hyphens. The OCR output is all letters, no numbers. So "13-110" isn't present here. 

So neither of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "CAPITALBUS", which is a different word. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. Even though there's a typo, but since there's no match in the words, it's not considered correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
