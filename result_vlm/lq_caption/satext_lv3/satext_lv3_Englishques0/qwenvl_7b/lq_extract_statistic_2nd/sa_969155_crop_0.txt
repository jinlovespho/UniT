gt_text: OFFICE POST
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth is "OFFICE POST" and the OCR output is "POST OFFICE". The user wants me to compare these based on specific rules.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "POST OFFICE". Then, compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that's okay. 

Next, check the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "OFFICE" and "POST". The OCR output also has "POST" and "OFFICE". So both words are present. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, which they both have in uppercase, but even if they were different cases, it wouldn't matter. Also, extra spaces or punctuation aren't an issue here. There are no typos mentioned, so "POST" and "OFFICE" are exact matches. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, even though the order is different, that should be category 1. The user said that word order doesn't matter, so this is a correct match. I don't see any missing words or typos that would make it a partial match. So the answer should be 1.
