gt_text: UNESCO
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UNESCO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Next, I compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified criteria.

The ground truth has the word "UNESCO". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring word order, capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

But here, the OCR output doesn't have the word "UNESCO" at all. It's "100%", which is a number. Since there's no overlap in the words between the ground truth and the OCR output, even considering the mentioned factors, there's no match. The category definitions state that category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So, the answer should be category 3.
