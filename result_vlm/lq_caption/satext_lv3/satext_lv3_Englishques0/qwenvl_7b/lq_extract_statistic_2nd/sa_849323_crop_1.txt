gt_text: TURKISHAIRLINES
vlm_output: TURKISHAIRLINES

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TURKISHAIRLINES" and the VLM OCR output is also "TURKISHAIRLINES". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "TURKISHAIRLINES".

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both texts are the same.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is a single word: "TURKISHAIRLINES". The OCR output is also the same single word. So the set of unique words in both are identical.

The other considerations are about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, both texts are all uppercase with no spaces or punctuation. There are no typos here either since they are exactly the same.

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (which they do here), it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
