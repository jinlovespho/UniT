gt_text: WDR
vlm_output: WDR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "WDR" and the VLM OCR output is also "WDR". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "WDR". The OCR output also has "WDR". 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned here because the OCR output is identical. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "WDR") are present in the OCR output, this should fall under category 1. The other categories don't apply here because there's no partial match or no match. The answer should be 1.
