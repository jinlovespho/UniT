gt_text: DIDZIOJI 17
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DIDZIOJI 17" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "DIDZIOJI 17".

The instructions say to consider word order as not important. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "DIDZIOJI" and "17". Wait, but "17" is a number, not a word. However, the problem mentions unique words, so maybe numbers are considered as words here. Let me check the categories again. The categories mention "unique words in the ground truth", so "DIDZIOJI" and "17" are the two unique elements.

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "100%", which has a percentage sign. But the ground truth doesn't have any punctuation except maybe the space. However, the OCR output's punctuation might be ignored. Also, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage, but the ground truth has "17" as a number. 

Now, the comparison: do any of the unique words from the ground truth appear in the OCR output? The ground truth words are "DIDZIOJI" and "17". The OCR output is "100%", which has the number 100 and a percentage. The number 17 is not present here. The word "DIDZIOJI" is a Lithuanian word, which doesn't appear in the OCR output. 

But the problem says to consider small typos as matches. However, there's no typo here; the OCR output is completely different. The OCR output has "100%" instead of "17" and no mention of "DIDZIOJI". 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (even after ignoring case, punctuation, etc.), the category should be 3 — Incorrect. Because there's no match for either of the two unique words. Even if we consider "17" vs "100%", they are different numbers, so no match. Therefore, the answer is category 3.
