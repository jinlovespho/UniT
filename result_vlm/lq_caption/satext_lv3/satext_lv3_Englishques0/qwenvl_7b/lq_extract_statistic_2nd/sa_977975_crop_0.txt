gt_text: OSIRIS
vlm_output: 1972

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OSIRIS" and the VLM OCR output is "1972". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's "1972".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OSIRIS" since it's one word. The OCR output is "1972", which is a number. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "1972" is a number, and "OSIRIS" is a word. There's no overlap here. The OCR output doesn't have any letters, just digits. So there's no matching word. Also, typos are considered, but in this case, there's no letters at all. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth. Even if I consider typos, but since the OCR output is entirely numbers, there's no possible match. So the answer should be 3.
