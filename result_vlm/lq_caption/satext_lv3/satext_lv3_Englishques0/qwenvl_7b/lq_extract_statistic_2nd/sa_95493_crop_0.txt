gt_text: LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY
vlm_output: LIBRARY GALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY" and the VLM OCR output is "LIBRARY GALLERY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here: "LIBRARY GALLERY". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "LEEDS", "LIBRARY", and "GALLERY". But wait, "LIBRARY" appears twice in the ground truth. However, the instructions say to consider only the set of unique words. So the unique words in the ground truth are "LEEDS", "LIBRARY", and "GALLERY".

Now, looking at the OCR output: "LIBRARY GALLERY". The unique words here are "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY". So, comparing the two sets:

Ground truth unique words: {LEEDS, LIBRARY, GALLERY}
OCR output unique words: {LIBRARY, GALLERY}

So, the OCR output is missing "LEEDS" but includes "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY". According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. If at least one but not all, it's category 2. If none or unrelated, category 3.

Since the OCR output is missing "LEEDS", which is a unique word in the ground truth, it doesn't have all the words. However, it does have two out of three. But the category definitions say "all unique ground truth words" for category 1. Since "LEEDS" is missing, it can't be category 1. But since it has some (two) of the three, it's category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo, just a missing word. The OCR output didn't capture "LEEDS" at all. So, the OCR output is missing one of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, it's not fully correct (category 1), but it's partially correct (category 2). 

So the answer should be category 2.
