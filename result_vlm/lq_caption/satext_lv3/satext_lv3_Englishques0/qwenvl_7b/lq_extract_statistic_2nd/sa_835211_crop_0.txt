gt_text: SWITCH NINTENDO
vlm_output: NINTENDO SWITCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SWITCH NINTENDO" and the VLM OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NINTENDO SWITCH", which is straightforward.

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SWITCH" and "NINTENDO". The OCR output also has the same two words, but in reverse order. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is different, the words are the same. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, but both are in uppercase here, so that's not an issue. There are no typos mentioned, and the spacing is just a single space between the words. 

Since both words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is swapped, the category should be 1 — Correct. The key points here are that all unique words from the ground truth are present, and the order doesn't matter. There's no mention of any typos, so even if there were minor ones, they still count as matches. In this case, there are no typos. 

So the answer should be category 1.
