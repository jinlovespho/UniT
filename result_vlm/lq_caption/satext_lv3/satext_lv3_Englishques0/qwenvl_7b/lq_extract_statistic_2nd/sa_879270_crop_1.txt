gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: EVERGREEN

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "EVERGREEN". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EVERGREEN". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Next, ignoring capitalization. Both are in all caps, but even if they weren't, they'd still match. Punctuation and spaces are irrelevant here because there's no punctuation or spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but in this case, there are no typos. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
