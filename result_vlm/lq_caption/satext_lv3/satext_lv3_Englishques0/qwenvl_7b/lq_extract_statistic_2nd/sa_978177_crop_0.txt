gt_text: GARDERES BRASSERIE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "GARDERES BRASSERIE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, the ground truth has two words: "GARDERES" and "BRASSERIE". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output here is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. The ground truth words are both proper nouns, likely names of a place (like a restaurant). 

The key point is whether any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain either "GARDERES" or "BRASSERIE". Even if we consider ignoring punctuation, "100%" becomes "100", which is still not related to the words in the ground truth. 

The rules also state that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no overlapping letters or similar words. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of content. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
