Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "101" and the VLM OCR output is also "101". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "101", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are just the number "101". Since there's only one "word" (assuming numbers are treated as words here), the order isn't an issue. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "101". The OCR output also has "101", so the unique words match. 

Other factors to consider: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation involved. The spacing is also the same since both are just "101" with no spaces. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has that same word, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches perfectly. So the answer should be 1.
