gt_text: 11

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "11" and the VLM OCR output is also "11". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "11".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same. Then, considering only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "11", which is one unique word. The OCR output also has "11", so that's a match.

The other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since both are just numbers without any of those, that's not an issue. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're exactly the same.

So according to the categories, since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
