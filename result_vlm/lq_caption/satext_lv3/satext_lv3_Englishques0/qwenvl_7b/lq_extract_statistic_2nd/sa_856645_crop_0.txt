gt_text: Bank Deutsche
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank Deutsche". The VLM OCR output is "100%".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is "Bank Deutsche".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Bank" and "Deutsche". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output has no words that match "Bank" or "Deutsche". Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "100%" doesn't contain either of those words. There are no typos here because the OCR output isn't even close to the words in the ground truth. 

So, according to the categories, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words.
