gt_text: Treasures Hidden
vlm_output: 1000

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Treasures Hidden" and the VLM OCR output is "1000". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1000", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Treasures" and "Hidden". The OCR output has no words, just numbers. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since the OCR output has no words, there's nothing to compare. Also, the categories are based on unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't have any of those words. Even if we consider typos or case, "1000" isn't a word that matches "Treasures" or "Hidden". 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 - Incorrect.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 123
2. Slightly Correct Num: 58
3. Incorrect Num: 315
