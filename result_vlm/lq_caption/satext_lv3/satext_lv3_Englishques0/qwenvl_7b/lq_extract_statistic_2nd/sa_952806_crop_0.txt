gt_text: VUITTON LOUIS
vlm_output: LOUIS VUITTON

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "VUITTON LOUIS" and the VLM OCR output is "LOUIS VUITTON". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "LOUIS VUITTON". 

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed in the OCR output, that shouldn't affect the comparison. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "VUITTON" and "LOUIS". The OCR output has the same words but in reverse order. But since order doesn't matter, both words are present. 

Then, we have to ignore capitalization. The ground truth has "VUITTON" and "LOUIS" in uppercase, but the OCR output also has them in uppercase. Wait, but the ground truth is "VUITTON LOUIS" and the OCR is "LOUIS VUITTON". Both are uppercase, so capitalization isn't an issue here. 

Also, check for extra or missing spaces. The ground truth has a space between the two words, and the OCR output also has a space between them. So spacing is correct. 

Typos are considered as matches. There are no typos here; both words are spelled correctly. 

So the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. 

I don't see any issues here. The words are the same, order doesn't matter, and all words are present. So the answer should be category 1.
