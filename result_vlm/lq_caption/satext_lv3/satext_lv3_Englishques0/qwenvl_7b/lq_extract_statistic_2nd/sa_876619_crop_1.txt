Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "gornergrat" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "10", which is a number.

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth is a single word, "gornergrat". The OCR output is "10", which is a number. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word. The OCR output has "10", which is not a word but a number. 

But wait, the instructions mention to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output doesn't have any words that match "gornergrat" (it's a number), there are no matches. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since "10" is unrelated to "gornergrat" and there are no matching words, the category should be 3. Even though there's a typo consideration, "10" isn't a typo of "gornergrat" but a completely different type of input. So, category 3.
