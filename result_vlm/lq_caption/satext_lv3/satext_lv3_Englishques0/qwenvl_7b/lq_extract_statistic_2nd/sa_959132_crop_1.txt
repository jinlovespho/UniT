gt_text: GRANDE SHOP HOTO A
vlm_output: HOTO SHOP

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) for the OCR output compared to the ground truth text. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "HOTO SHOP". So the extracted text is just that.

Next, compare it with the ground truth text, which is "GRANDE SHOP HOTO A". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So, let's break down the ground truth into unique words. The ground truth text is "GRANDE SHOP HOTO A". Splitting by spaces, the words are "GRANDE", "SHOP", "HOTO", and "A". But since we're considering unique words, we need to check if these are all unique. "GRANDE", "SHOP", "HOTO", "A" – all are unique. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, does that mean we take the unique words from the ground truth and check if they are all present in the OCR output? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the instruction says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the unique words from the ground truth are the ones we need to check if they are present in the OCR output. Let me confirm: the ground truth has "GRANDE", "SHOP", "HOTO", "A". The OCR output is "HOTO SHOP". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are GRANDE, SHOP, HOTO, A. Now, check if all of these are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "HOTO" and "SHOP". But what about "GRANDE" and "A"? The OCR output doesn't have those words. 

But wait, the instruction says to consider that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output doesn't have "GRANDE" or "A" at all. Are they typos? The OCR output is missing those words entirely. So, even if there were typos, the presence of the words is missing. 

So, the unique words in ground truth are four: GRANDE, SHOP, HOTO, A. The OCR output has two words: HOTO and SHOP. So, two out of four unique words are present. But the category definitions say:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.

2 — Slightly correct (partially correct): at least one but not all unique words match.

3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

In this case, the OCR output has two of the four unique words. So that's at least one but not all. Therefore, category 2. But wait, the OCR output has two words that are in the ground truth. But the ground truth has four unique words. So, it's not all, but at least one. So category 2.

But wait, let me check again. The ground truth's unique words are GRANDE, SHOP, HOTO, A. The OCR output has HOTO and SHOP. So two matches. So, at least one, but not all. So category 2.

But what about the case where the OCR output has some words that are not in the ground truth? The problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we don't care about extra words in the OCR output. We only check if the ground truth's unique words are present in the OCR output. 

So, the OCR output has two of the four unique ground truth words. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 185
2. Slightly Correct Num: 94
3. Incorrect Num: 496
