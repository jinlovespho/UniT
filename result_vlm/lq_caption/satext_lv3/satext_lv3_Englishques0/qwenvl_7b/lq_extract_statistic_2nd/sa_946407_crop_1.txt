gt_text: Jewelry Artinian
vlm_output: 1025

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Jewelry Artinian". The OCR output is "1025". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1025", which is just numbers. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Jewelry" and "Artinian". The OCR output has numbers, not words. So, the extracted text from OCR is "1025", which doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The rules say that we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has no words (only numbers), there's no match. Also, the categories mention that if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there were typos, but here the OCR output is numbers, which are not words. So, there's no match. Therefore, it's category 3.
