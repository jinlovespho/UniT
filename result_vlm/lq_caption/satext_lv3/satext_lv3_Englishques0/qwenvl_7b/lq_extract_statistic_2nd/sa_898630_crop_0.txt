gt_text: IKEA
vlm_output: IKEA

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth is "IKEA" and the OCR output is also "IKEA". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here.

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since both are just "IKEA", the order is the same, but even if it wasn't, they're the same word. 

Then, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "IKEA". The OCR output also has "IKEA". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Typos are considered as matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
