gt_text: User guide
vlm_output: User guide

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "User guide" and the VLM OCR output is also "User guide". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts have the same words in the same order. However, even if the order was different, like "guide user", it would still be considered correct because order doesn't matter. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "User" and "guide". The OCR output has the same two words. So all unique words are present. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no typo mentioned either. So all the criteria are met. 

The categories are 1 for correct, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output. Since both are identical, it's definitely category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. So the answer should be 1.
