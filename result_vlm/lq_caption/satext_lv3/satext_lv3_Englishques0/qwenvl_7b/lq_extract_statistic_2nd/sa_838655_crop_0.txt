gt_text: iPhone
vlm_output: iPhone

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "iPhone" and the VLM OCR output is also "iPhone". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "iPhone".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria given are:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "iPhone".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output matches exactly in capitalization and spacing.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories:

1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "iPhone" and the ground truth is "iPhone", that's a perfect match. All unique words (just one) are present.

So the answer should be category 1.
