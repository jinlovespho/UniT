gt_text: FRUIT PUNCH
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FRUIT PUNCH" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is "FRUIT PUNCH".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two unique words: "FRUIT" and "PUNCH". The OCR output is "100%", which is a single word, but it's a number, not a word related to fruit or punch.

Now, checking if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "100%" doesn't contain "FRUIT" or "PUNCH" in any form. Even if we consider typos, "100%" is a number, not a misspelling of either word. There's no overlap in the words. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any of the required words.
