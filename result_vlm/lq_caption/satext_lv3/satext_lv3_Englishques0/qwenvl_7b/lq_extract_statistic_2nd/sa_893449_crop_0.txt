gt_text: POSTAGE
vlm_output: POSTAGE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POSTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POSTAGE". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "POSTAGE", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both texts are the same word. 

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POSTAGE". The OCR output also has "POSTAGE", so the unique words match. 

The guidelines also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are all caps and no spaces, so that's not an issue. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since they are identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. 

I don't see any other words or discrepancies. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match under the given criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
