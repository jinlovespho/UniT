Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1057" and the VLM OCR output is also "1057". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "1057", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "1057".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both the ground truth and the OCR output are the same. 

The ground truth is "1057". The OCR output is also "1057". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "1057". The OCR output has the same word. Since they are identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output matches exactly, it should be category 1. There's no difference here, so no typos or missing words. Even if there were a typo, the instructions say small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. So the answer is 1.
