<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "F193 193" and the VLM OCR output is "F-193". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "F-193". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "F193 193".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into unique words. The ground truth has "F193" and "193". So the unique words are {"F193", "193"}.

Now, the OCR output is "F-193". Let's process this. The OCR output has one word: "F-193". But we need to check if this matches any of the unique words from the ground truth, considering possible typos, ignoring punctuation, and case. 

Looking at "F-193" versus "F193": if we ignore the hyphen (-), then "F-193" becomes "F193", which is exactly one of the unique words in the ground truth. The other unique word in the ground truth is "193". The OCR output's "F-193" includes "193" as part of it, but since the OCR output is treated as a single word, does that count as containing "193"? Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So each unique word in the ground truth must be present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "F-193", which is a single word. Let me check the criteria again.

The criteria say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So, the OCR output needs to contain all the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "F193" and "193". The OCR output is "F-193". Now, does "F-193" contain both "F193" and "193"? 

If we consider that "F-193" can be transformed by removing the hyphen to become "F193", which is one of the ground truth words. But the other word in the ground truth is "193". The OCR output's word "F-193" includes "193" as a substring. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So does "F-193" count as containing "193"? The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but they don't specify if substrings count. Wait, the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not sure about substrings.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's words are split into tokens. If the OCR output is "F-193", perhaps it's considered as one token. The ground truth has two tokens: "F193" and "193". So the OCR output has one token, which might not contain both. However, if we can split the OCR output into words, but the problem says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a single word, "F-193".

But maybe the hyphen is considered a typo. If we remove the hyphen, "F-193" becomes "F193", which matches one of the ground truth words. However, the other ground truth word is "193". The OCR output's "F-193" includes "193" as part of it. But does that count as containing "193" as a separate word? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output is "F-193", does that include "193" as a word? Or is it considered as a single word that doesn't contain "193" as a separate word?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let's recheck the instructions. It says "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So each unique word in the ground truth must be present in the OCR output. The OCR output's words are "F-193". If we process this by ignoring punctuation (hyphen), then "F-193" becomes "F193", which is one of the ground truth words. But the other ground truth word is "193". The OCR output's word "F-193" includes "193" as part of it, but is "193" considered present? If the OCR output is allowed to have substrings, then maybe. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "F193" (after removing the hyphen) and "193" is a substring, but not a separate word, then it's not present.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have "F-193" as a single token, and we need to check if each unique ground truth word is present in that token, considering typos and ignoring punctuation. For example, "F-193" can be transformed to "F193" by removing the hyphen, which matches "F193" from the ground truth. But "193" is a substring of "F193", so perhaps "193" is also considered present? But the problem states that the OCR output is "F-193", which is one word. The ground truth has two words. So if the OCR output's word contains both "F193" and "193" when processed, then it would be considered as containing both. However, the instructions don't explicitly say that substrings count. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is split into words, but in this case, it's a single word. The ground truth has two words. The OCR output has one word. So unless the OCR output's word can be split into the two ground truth words, which it can't because "F-193" can't be split into "F193" and "193" without the hyphen. But if we remove the hyphen, it becomes "F193", which is one of the ground truth words. However, the other ground truth word "193" is a substring of "F193", but not a separate word. 

This is tricky. Let me think again. The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but they don't mention substrings. The key is that the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "F193" and "193". The OCR output has one word: "F-193". If we can process the OCR output's word by removing the hyphen to get "F193", which matches one of the ground truth words. However, the other word "193" is not present as a separate word in the OCR output. Therefore, only one of the two unique words is present. 

But wait, the OCR output's word "F-193" contains "193" as part of it. If we consider that "193" is a substring, maybe it's considered as present. But the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words. So unless the OCR output has "193" as a separate word, which it doesn't. Therefore, the OCR output has only one unique word that matches "F193", but not "193". 

So in that case, the OCR output has at least one unique word matching (F193), but not all. Therefore, it would be category 2 (partially correct). 

But wait, maybe the ground truth's "193" is a substring of "F193" in the OCR output. If the OCR output's "F-193" is considered as "F193" (ignoring the hyphen), then "193" is part of that. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So maybe the presence of "193" as a substring is not sufficient. The OCR output must have the exact words (after processing) as in the ground truth. 

Alternatively, perhaps the OCR output's "F-193" is considered as containing both "F193" (after removing hyphen) and "193" (as part of the word). But I think the correct approach is that each unique word in the ground truth must be present in the OCR output as a separate word. Since the OCR output has only one word, which can be transformed to "F193", but not "193" as a separate word, then only one of the two is present. Therefore, the category would be 2 (partially correct). 

But another angle: the ground truth has "F193" and "193". The OCR output is "F-193". If we consider that "F-193" is a typo of "F193", and "193" is part of it, maybe the system considers that both are present. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. So if "F-193" can be transformed to "F193" (removing hyphen), then "F193" is present. But "193" is not present as a separate word. Therefore, only one of the two is present. So category 2. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output's "F-193" is considered to have both "F193" and "193" because "193" is part of it, but that's stretching the interpretation. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words, not substrings. Therefore, the answer would be category 2.
