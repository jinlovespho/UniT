gt_text: Only taxi
vlm_output: Only

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Only taxi" and the VLM OCR output is "Only". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "Only". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Only" and "taxi". The OCR output has only "Only". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since "taxi" is missing, that means not all words are there. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Here, "Only" is a match, but "taxi" is missing. So it's partially correct. 

Also, checking for typos, but there's no typo here—just a missing word. So the answer should be category 2.
