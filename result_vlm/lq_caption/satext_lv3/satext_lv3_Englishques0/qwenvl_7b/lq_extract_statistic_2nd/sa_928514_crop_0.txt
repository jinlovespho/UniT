gt_text: DELIVER
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DELIVER" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "DELIVER", which is a word. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DELIVER". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Next, I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The word "DELIVER" isn't in "10%", so there's no match. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's not present, that's not the case. Category 2 is for partial matches, but since there are no matches at all, it's not applicable. Therefore, it falls under Category 3, which is incorrect when no words match or the output is unrelated.

So the answer should be category 3.
