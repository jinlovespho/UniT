gt_text: Dunelm

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Dunelm" and the VLM OCR output is also "Dunelm". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Dunelm".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Dunelm".

Now, checking the OCR output. It's also "Dunelm", so the same word. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same. There's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but here there's no typo at all.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "Dunelm") are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1: Correct. The answer should be 1.
