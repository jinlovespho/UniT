gt_text: ARNOLD HAWKER HOUSE
vlm_output: ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "ARNOLD HAWKER HOUSE" and the OCR output is "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done here. Then, compare the words. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: ARNOLD, HAWKER, HOUSE. 

Now, the OCR output has two words: ARNOLD and HUNTERSCULPTOR. Let's check each word from the ground truth against the OCR output. 

ARNOLD is present in both, so that's a match. The other words are HAWKER and HOUSE. The OCR output has HUNTERSCULPTOR instead. Now, the instructions say small typos still count as matches. But HUNTERSCULPTOR vs HAWKER—those don't seem like small typos. HAWKER is a surname, and HUNTERSCULPTOR is a longer word. Maybe HUNTERSCULPTOR is a typo for HAWKER? But I don't think they are similar enough. For example, if it were "HAWKER" vs "HAWKERS", that's a small typo. But here, the OCR output has a completely different word. 

So, the only matching word is ARNOLD. The other two words in the ground truth (HAWKER and HOUSE) are not present in the OCR output. Therefore, only one of the three unique words matches. According to the categories, category 2 is "at least one but not all unique words match." So the answer should be 2.
