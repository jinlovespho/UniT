gt_text: Hybrid Taxi
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Hybrid Taxi", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Hybrid" and "Taxi". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "Hybrid" and "Taxi". The OCR output doesn't have either of these words. The OCR output is a percentage, which is unrelated to the words in the ground truth. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique words from the ground truth are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but not all. But in this case, there are no matches. So, it would fall under Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Even though there's a possibility of a typo, the OCR output here is "100%", which doesn't resemble "Hybrid" or "Taxi" in any way. So, the answer should be Category 3.
