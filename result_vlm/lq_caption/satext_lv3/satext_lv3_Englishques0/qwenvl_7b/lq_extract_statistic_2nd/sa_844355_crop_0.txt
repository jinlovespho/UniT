gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Bank", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Bank".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "Bank". Now, the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but here both have the same single word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Bank". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Bank") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. The answer should be 1.
