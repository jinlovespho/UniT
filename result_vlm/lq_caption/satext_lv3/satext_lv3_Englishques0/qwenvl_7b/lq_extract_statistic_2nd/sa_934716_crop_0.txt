gt_text: TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM" and the OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3). 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is just numbers. Then, step 2 says to compare this with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me break down the ground truth into words. The original text is "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM". Splitting by spaces, that's four words: TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, UM. But wait, the last word is "UM" with a space before it? Or is it "PRÆSIDI UM" as two separate words? Let me check the original again. The ground truth is written as "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM". So, that's four words: TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, and UM. 

Now, the OCR output is "1970". The user says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, UM. So, the OCR output has "1970", which is numbers. The question is, do any of these words match? 

The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output is numbers, not words. So, "1970" doesn't seem to be any of the words in the ground truth. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but here the OCR output isn't even a word from the ground truth. 

So, the category options are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one matches, or 3 if none match. Since "1970" is numbers and none of the ground truth words are numbers, there's no match. Therefore, the category would be 3. 

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The ground truth has words like "SUB", which is a word, but the OCR output is numbers. So, no overlap. Hence, category 3.
