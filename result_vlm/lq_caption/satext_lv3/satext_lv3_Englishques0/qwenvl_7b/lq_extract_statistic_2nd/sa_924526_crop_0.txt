gt_text: Hilton
vlm_output: Hilton

----------------------------

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "Hilton" and the VLM OCR output is also "Hilton". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Hilton", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts have only one word, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Hilton".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly "Hilton", so there's no difference in capitalization or spacing.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are the same.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "Hilton" which matches the ground truth's "Hilton", this should be a correct match.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so all conditions are met for category 1.
