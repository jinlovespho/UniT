gt_text: VERSACE
vlm_output: VERSACE

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VERSACE" and the VLM OCR output is also "VERSACE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "VERSACE", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "VERSACE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Also, we need to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "VERSACE". The OCR output also has "VERSACE" as the only word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. There's no typo here because they are exactly the same. So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (which they are), then it's category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches exactly. So the answer should be 1.
