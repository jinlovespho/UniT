gt_text: Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE
vlm_output: Tropical

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE". The OCR output from the VLM is just "Tropical".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "Tropical".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: Tropical, CERVEZA, CANARIAS, DE. Wait, but the user said to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. So those four words are the unique ones. But the OCR output only has "Tropical".

Now, checking the rules. The comparison should ignore word order, case, spacing, and typos. So "Tropical" in the OCR matches "Tropical" in the ground truth exactly. The other words in the ground truth (CERVEZA, CANARIAS, DE) are not present in the OCR output.

But the category definitions say: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the four is present. So that's not Category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since one word does match, that would be Category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. But here, one does match, so not 3.

Wait, but the user mentioned "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has four unique words. The OCR output has one word, which matches one of them. So according to the criteria, since at least one matches but not all, it's Category 2. So the answer should be 2.
