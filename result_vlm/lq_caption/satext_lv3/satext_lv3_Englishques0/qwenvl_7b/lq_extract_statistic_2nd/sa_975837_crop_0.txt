gt_text: Buvette Bateau
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Buvette Bateau". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Buvette" and "Bateau". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, according to the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we have to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "100%" doesn't contain either "Buvette" or "Bateau". The OCR output is a number, not the words from the ground truth. 

Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but even with that, "100%" doesn't match either word. The words in the ground truth are French, but the OCR output is a percentage. There's no overlap in the words. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
