gt_text: ARMARIS
vlm_output: 102345

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ARMARIS" and the VLM OCR output is "102345". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "102345", which is a sequence of numbers. The ground truth is "ARMARIS", which is a word, probably a name or a term.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ARMARIS". 

Now, the OCR output is "102345". This is a string of digits. The problem mentions that we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output here is entirely numeric, which doesn't match the alphabetic characters in the ground truth. Also, the criteria mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in characters between the two. 

Since the ground truth is a word and the OCR output is numbers, there's no matching word. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the letters in "ARMARIS". Even if we consider typos, the OCR output is completely different in terms of character type. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
