Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "8" and the VLM OCR output is "1". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "1".

Step 2: Compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "8". Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single characters, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "8". The OCR output has "1". 

Now, checking if they match. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But "1" and "8" are different numbers. Are they considered typos? Well, maybe in some contexts, but in this case, they are distinct. The instructions also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but here there's no punctuation or spacing issues. 

So, the unique word in the ground truth is "8", and the OCR output has "1". Since they are different, there are no matching words. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is "1", which is unrelated to "8". So the answer should be 3.
