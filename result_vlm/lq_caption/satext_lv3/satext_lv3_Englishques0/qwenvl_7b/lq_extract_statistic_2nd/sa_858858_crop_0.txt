gt_text: DOUBLETREE HILTON
vlm_output: 120

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DOUBLETREE HILTON" and the VLM OCR output is "120". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "120", which is a number. The ground truth is two words: "DOUBLETREE" and "HILTON". 

Moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has "120", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "120" is a numeral, not a word. The ground truth words are "DOUBLETREE" and "HILTON". Even if we consider possible typos, "120" doesn't resemble either of these words. For example, "120" could be a typo for "DOUBLE" (if someone misread "120" as "DOUBLE"), but "120" doesn't contain "HILTON" or "DOUBLETREE" in any form. 

The categories are as follows: 
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated/empty.

In this case, the OCR output is "120", which is unrelated to the ground truth words. There's no overlap in words, even considering typos. Therefore, it doesn't meet Category 1 or 2. Since there are no matching words, it falls under Category 3.
