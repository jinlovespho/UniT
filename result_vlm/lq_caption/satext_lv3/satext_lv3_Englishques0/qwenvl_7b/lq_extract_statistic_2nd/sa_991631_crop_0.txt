gt_text: Scoopy
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Scoopy" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "Scoopy". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Scoopy". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. There's no overlap in words here. "100%" isn't a word that's similar to "Scoopy" even with typos. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any matching words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "Scoopy". They are completely different in terms of letters and meaning. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
