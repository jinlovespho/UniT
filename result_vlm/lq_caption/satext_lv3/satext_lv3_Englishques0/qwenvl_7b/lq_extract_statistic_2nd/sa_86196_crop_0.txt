gt_text: CROWN

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "CROWN" and a VLM OCR output of "CROWN". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "CROWN", so that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "CROWN", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "CROWN". Since both are the same word, and considering that capitalization is ignored, there's no difference here. Also, there are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("CROWN") and the OCR output has the same word, this matches perfectly. 

I should check if there's any possibility of it being a different category. For example, if the OCR had a typo like "CROWE" or "CROWN " with a space, but in this case, it's exactly the same. So, there's no issue here. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 1.
