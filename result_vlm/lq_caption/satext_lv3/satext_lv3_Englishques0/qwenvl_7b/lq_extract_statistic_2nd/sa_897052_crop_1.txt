gt_text: September- plein 18 Emmasingel
vlm_output: 1000

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "September- plein 18 Emmasingel" and the VLM OCR output is "1000". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1000", which is a number. 

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: September, plein, 18, Emmasingel. Let's break them down. 

The OCR output is "1000". Now, considering the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. 
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth. 
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. 
- Small typos still count as matches. 

Looking at the OCR output, "1000" is a number. The ground truth has words like "September", "plein", "18", "Emmasingel". The number "18" is in the ground truth. The OCR output has "1000", which is a different number. However, maybe there's a typo? But "1000" isn't a typo of "18"; they are different numbers. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "September", "plein", "18", "Emmasingel". The OCR output has "1000", which is a number, not any of these words. None of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories: 

- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. 
- Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But there's no match. 
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be category 3.
