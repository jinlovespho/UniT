gt_text: CROSSWIND M/T
vlm_output: 1980

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CROSSWIND M/T" and the VLM OCR output is "1980". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1980", which is a number. The ground truth has two words: "CROSSWIND" and "M/T". 

Now, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output has no words related to "CROSSWIND" or "M/T". The OCR output is a year, which is completely different. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in words at all. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. 

I should check if there's any possible way "1980" could be a typo or related. But "1980" is a number, not a word. The ground truth words are "CROSSWIND" and "M/T". There's no match here. So the answer should be category 3.
