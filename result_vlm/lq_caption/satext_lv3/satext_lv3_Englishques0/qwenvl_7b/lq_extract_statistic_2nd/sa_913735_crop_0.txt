gt_text: Schweppes
vlm_output: Schweppes

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Schweppes" and the VLM OCR output is also "Schweppes". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Schweppes", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Schweppes". The OCR output also has "Schweppes". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The other factors to consider: capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The ground truth and OCR output both have the same capitalization (capital S) and no punctuation or extra spaces. There's no typo here either since they are identical.

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
