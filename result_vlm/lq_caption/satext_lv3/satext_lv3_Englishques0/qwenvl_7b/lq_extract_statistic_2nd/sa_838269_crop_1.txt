Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output is "Google", which is exactly the same. So when comparing, even if there were typos, like "Goggle" or "Gooogle", they'd still count as matches. But here, it's perfect. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Google") are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, category 1 applies. There's no partial match here because the OCR output has exactly the same word. So the answer should be 1.
