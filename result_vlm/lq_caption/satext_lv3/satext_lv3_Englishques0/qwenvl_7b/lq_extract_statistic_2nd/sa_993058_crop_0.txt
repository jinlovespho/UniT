Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RAILWAY" and the VLM OCR output is also "RAILWAY". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "RAILWAY", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "RAILWAY".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The ground truth has only one unique word: "RAILWAY". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has the same word, all unique words from the ground truth are present. Also, ignoring case, but both are uppercase. No typos, so that's fine. The spacing is the same. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique words match. There's no missing or extra words. So the answer should be 1.
