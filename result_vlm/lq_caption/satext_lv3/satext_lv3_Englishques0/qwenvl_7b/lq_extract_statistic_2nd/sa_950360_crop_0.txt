gt_text: Rodeo
vlm_output: Rodeo

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rodeo" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rodeo". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Rodeo".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. Then, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rodeo". The OCR output also has "Rodeo". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (assuming the OCR output is correctly capitalized as "Rodeo" like the ground truth). There's no punctuation or spaces to consider here since it's a single word. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
