gt_text: NIS A-1 13 No JET GAZPROM NEFT
vlm_output: NIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NIS A-1 13 No JET GAZPROM NEFT", and the VLM OCR output is just "NIS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "NIS". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are NIS, A-1, 13, No, JET, GAZPROM, NEFT. Wait, but the OCR output only has "NIS". 

Now, the comparison criteria: check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But the OCR output only has one word, NIS. The other words like A-1, 13, No, etc., are not present. 

But the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output only has NIS, which is one of the unique words in the ground truth, but the rest are missing. So it's partially correct. 

Wait, but the question says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the OCR output needs to have all of those words? But in this case, the OCR output only has one word. So the answer would be category 2, because at least one word (NIS) matches, but not all. 

But wait, the ground truth has multiple unique words. The OCR output only has one. So even though NIS is present, the other words are missing. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2. 

I think that's right. The answer should be 2.
