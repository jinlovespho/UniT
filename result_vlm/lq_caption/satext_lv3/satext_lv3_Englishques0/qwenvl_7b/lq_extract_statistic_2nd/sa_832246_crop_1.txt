gt_text: JADES MEN
vlm_output: 1980

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JADES MEN" and the VLM OCR output is "1980". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1980", which is a number. The ground truth is "JADES MEN", which are two words. 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "JADES" and "MEN". 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output here is "1980", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. There's no mention of "JADES" or "MEN" in the OCR output. 

The rules also state that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo because the OCR output isn't even close to the words in the ground truth. It's entirely different. 

So, according to the categories: 
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. Here, neither "JADES" nor "MEN" are in "1980".
- Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words matching. But since none match, it's not category 2.
- Category 3 is for no words matching or the output being unrelated. Since the OCR output is a number and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, this fits category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
