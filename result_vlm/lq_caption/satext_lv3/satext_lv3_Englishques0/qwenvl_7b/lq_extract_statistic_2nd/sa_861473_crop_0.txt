gt_text: INTERCONTINENTAL
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INTERCONTINENTAL" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is a single word: "INTERCONTINENTAL".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "INTERCONTINENTAL". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Next, I need to check if there's any match. The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but "100%" is not a typo of "INTERCONTINENTAL". They are completely different. Also, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "100%" doesn't contain any letters from the ground truth word. 

Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth, even considering the rules, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match at all. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the required word.
