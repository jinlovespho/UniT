gt_text: HUAWEI

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUAWEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "HUAWEI". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "HUAWEI".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "HUAWEI". The OCR output is the same. So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like maybe "Huwaei", it would still count as a match because small typos are considered correct. But in this case, they are exactly the same. So according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
