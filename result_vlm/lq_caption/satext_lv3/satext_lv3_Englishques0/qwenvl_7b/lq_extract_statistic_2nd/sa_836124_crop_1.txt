gt_text: NEMO

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NEMO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "NEMO". Let's break down the comparison. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is a proper noun, possibly a name or a term. The key here is that the OCR output doesn't have any words that are similar to "NEMO". Even if we consider case and punctuation, "100%" is a number, not a word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NEMO", and the OCR output doesn't have that word. There's no mention of typos here because "100%" isn't a typo of "NEMO"; they are entirely different. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's no match here, that's not it. Category 2 is partially correct if at least one unique word matches. But there's no match at all. So, it must be Category 3, which is incorrect when no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, so Category 3 applies.
