gt_text: 123 23
vlm_output: SUV

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "123 23" and the VLM OCR output is "SUV". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SUV", which is a single word. The ground truth has two numbers: "123" and "23". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "123" and "23". However, the OCR output is "SUV", which is a completely different word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "SUV" is all caps, but even if we lowercase it to "suv", it's still not matching "123" or "23". There's no mention of numbers in the OCR output. The ground truth has numerical values, but the OCR output has letters. 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's a complete mismatch. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has two unique words and the OCR output has none of them, even after considering all the rules, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no partial match here because "SUV" isn't related to the numbers in the ground truth. Even if we consider that maybe "SUV" could be a typo for a number, like "123" being misread as "SUV", but according to the rules, small typos still count as matches. However, "SUV" isn't a small typo of "123" or "23". It's a completely different word. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
