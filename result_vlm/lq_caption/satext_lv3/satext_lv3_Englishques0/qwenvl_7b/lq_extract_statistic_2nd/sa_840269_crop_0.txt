gt_text: CBRE NYC
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "CBRE NYC" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CBRE" and "NYC". 

Next, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. But the OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage symbol. The ground truth words are "CBRE" and "NYC", which are proper nouns, likely company and city names. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 2 if at least one but not all match. 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Looking at the OCR output "100%", there's no mention of "CBRE" or "NYC". The words in the OCR output are "100" and "%". These don't match the ground truth words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "CBRE" or "NYC". 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
