gt_text: GEDOENG JASINDO
vlm_output: PARK HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "GEDOENG JASINDO" and the VLM OCR output is "PARK HOTEL". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PARK HOTEL", so that's straightforward. Now, step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break that down.

The ground truth has two words: "GEDOENG" and "JASINDO". The OCR output has "PARK" and "HOTEL". Now, considering that capitalization doesn't matter, I can convert both to lowercase for comparison. So ground truth words are "gedoeng" and "jasindo", and OCR words are "park" and "hotel".

Next, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the words are completely different. "Gedoeng" vs "park" and "jasindo" vs "hotel". There's no overlap here. Even if there were typos, like if "gedoeng" was misspelled as "gedeeng", that might still count, but here the words are entirely different.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since neither "park" nor "hotel" are related to "gedoeng" or "jasindo", there are zero matches. So according to category 3, which is for no words matching or the output being largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. The OCR output isn't empty, but it's completely unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
