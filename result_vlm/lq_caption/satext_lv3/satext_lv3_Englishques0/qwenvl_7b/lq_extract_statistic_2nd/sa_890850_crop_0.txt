gt_text: OUTBACK SUPER-LITE
vlm_output: OUTBACK

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE" and the OCR output is "OUTBACK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text from the OCR output. That's just "OUTBACK".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". The OCR output only has "OUTBACK". 

Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". The OCR output has "OUTBACK" but not "SUPER-LITE". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or mostly wrong. Here, only one of the two words is present. So that's category 2, slightly correct. Even though there's a typo, but in this case, there's no typo in "OUTBACK" since it's exactly the same. But the missing "SUPER-LITE" means not all words are there. So the answer should be 2.
