gt_text: SMOKING
vlm_output: SMOKING

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SMOKING" and the VLM OCR output is also "SMOKING". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "SMOKING", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "SMOKING".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has some specific rules. Let me go through them one by one.

First, word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both the ground truth and the OCR output have only one word, so order isn't an issue here. 

Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SMOKING". The OCR output also has the same word. So the sets are identical.

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. So even if there were differences in case, they would be ignored. But here, they are the same.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, this meets category 1. 

There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. So it's not category 2. And definitely not category 3 since there's a full match. 

Therefore, the answer should be 1.
