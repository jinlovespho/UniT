gt_text: Card only
vlm_output: Card only

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Card only" and the VLM OCR output is also "Card only". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, the words are the same and in the same order. 

They also say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Card" and "only". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. No issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case since the OCR output is identical to the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both words are present and match exactly, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. So the answer is 1.
