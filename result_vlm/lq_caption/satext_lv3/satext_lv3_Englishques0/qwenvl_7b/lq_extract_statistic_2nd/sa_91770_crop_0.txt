Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "28" and the VLM OCR output is also "28". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output here is exactly "28", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are just single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "28". The OCR output also has "28", so they match exactly. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The output is correct. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "28" is the only word and it's present, that's a Category 1. 

No chance of Category 2 or 3 here. The output is fully correct. So the answer should be 1.
