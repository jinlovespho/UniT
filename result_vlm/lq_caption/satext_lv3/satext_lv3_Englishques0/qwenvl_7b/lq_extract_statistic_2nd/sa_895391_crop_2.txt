gt_text: Instituto
vlm_output: JAVELIN 400-5

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Instituto" and the VLM OCR output is "JAVELIN 400-5". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "JAVELIN 400-5". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Instituto". The OCR output has "JAVELIN", "400", and "5" as separate elements. Wait, but the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Instituto".

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But "JAVELIN" vs "Instituto" – they are completely different words. There's no overlap. Even if I consider typos, "JAVELIN" doesn't resemble "Instituto" in any way. The numbers 400-5 are not part of the ground truth words. 

So the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any of the required words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
