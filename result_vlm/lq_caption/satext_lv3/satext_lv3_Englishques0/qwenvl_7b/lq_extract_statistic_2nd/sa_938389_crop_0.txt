gt_text: DB 425 049 4 049-4
vlm_output: DB

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "DB 425 049 4 049-4". The VLM OCR output is just "DB". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "DB". 

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has several parts: "DB", "425", "049", "4", "049-4". But the OCR only captured "DB". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in the ground truth are "DB", "425", "049", "4", "049-4". Wait, "049" and "049-4" are different because of the hyphen. So those are separate words. 

The OCR output has "DB" which matches the first part of the ground truth. But the other numbers are missing. The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. 

Since the OCR only has "DB" and the ground truth has more words, but "DB" is present. However, the question is about the set of unique words. The ground truth's unique words include "DB", "425", "049", "4", "049-4". The OCR only has "DB". So only one unique word matches. That would be category 2—partially correct. 

But wait, the instructions say "all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output" for category 1. Since the OCR output doesn't have the other numbers, it's not category 1. So category 2 is correct here.
