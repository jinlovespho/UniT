gt_text: FRESH MANGO
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FRESH MANGO" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is "FRESH MANGO". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth words are "FRESH" and "MANGO". 

Looking at the OCR output, there are no words that match "FRESH" or "MANGO". The OCR output is a number and a symbol, which doesn't relate to the words in the ground truth. Even if I consider typos or other variations, "10%" doesn't resemble either of the words. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match, and the output is unrelated.
