gt_text: CIBC CIBC
vlm_output: 10%

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CIBC CIBC". So the unique words here are just "CIBC" since it's repeated. The VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "10%". Then compare it with the ground truth. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has the unique word "CIBC". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, checking if there's any match. "10%" doesn't have the word "CIBC" in it. The unique words in the OCR output are "10%", which isn't related to "CIBC". Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's a complete mismatch. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words ("CIBC") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. Because there's no match, and the output is unrelated.
