gt_text: GOVERNADOR PALÁCIO DO
vlm_output: 1920

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided the ground truth text "GOVERNADOR PALÁCIO DO" and the VLM OCR output "1920". They want me to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific criteria.

First, I need to understand the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1920", which is a number. Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But even with those considerations, the OCR output here is just numbers.

Looking at the ground truth, the unique words are "GOVERNADOR", "PALÁCIO", and "DO". The OCR output is "1920", which is four digits. None of these digits correspond to any of the words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output is entirely numerical and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even when considering possible typos or ignoring case and spacing, there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "1920" has no words in common with the ground truth, it falls into category 3. Even if we consider that maybe "1920" could be a typo for a word, the problem states that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output isn't even close to the words provided. There's no overlap in terms of letters or words. Therefore, the correct category is 3.
