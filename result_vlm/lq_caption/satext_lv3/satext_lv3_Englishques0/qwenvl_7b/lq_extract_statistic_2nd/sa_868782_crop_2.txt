gt_text: TD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TD" and the VLM OCR output is also "TD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "TD".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are "TD", so order is the same.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TD". The OCR output also has "TD". So the unique words match here.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and no spaces. So that's all the same.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So for the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "TD" is present in the OCR output, and there's only one unique word, this meets category 1. There's no case where partial matches are needed here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
