gt_text: CASINO
vlm_output: CASINO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CASINO" and the VLM OCR output is also "CASINO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "CASINO".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Then, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CASINO". The OCR output also has "CASINO". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces—there are none here. Typos? The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so no typos. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
