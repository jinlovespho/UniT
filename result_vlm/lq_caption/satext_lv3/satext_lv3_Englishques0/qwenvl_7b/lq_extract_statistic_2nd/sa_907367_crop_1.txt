gt_text: GR
vlm_output: GR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GR" and the VLM OCR output is also "GR". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's already "GR". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are just two letters, order isn't an issue here. The next point says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "GR" as a single word, right? Wait, but "GR" is two letters. Are we considering each letter as a separate word or the entire string as one word?

Hmm, the instructions say "unique words in the ground truth". If "GR" is considered a single word, then the OCR output also has "GR", so that's a match. But if the ground truth is split into individual letters, like "G" and "R", then the OCR output would need to have both. But the problem states that the ground truth is "GR" and the OCR output is "GR". So probably, "GR" is treated as a single word here.

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But both are uppercase and no spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. But there are no typos here since they're the same.

So, since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, all unique words (which is just "GR") are present. Therefore, it's category 1 — correct.
