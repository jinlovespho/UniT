gt_text: LV
vlm_output: LV

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LV" and the VLM OCR output is also "LV". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "LV".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has "LV" which is two letters. The OCR output is also "LV". Since they are exactly the same, even if we consider the unique words, both have the same set. There's no difference in capitalization here, no typos, and the order is the same. So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output, this should be correct. There's no missing words, and since it's exactly the same, it's a full match. So the answer should be category 1.
