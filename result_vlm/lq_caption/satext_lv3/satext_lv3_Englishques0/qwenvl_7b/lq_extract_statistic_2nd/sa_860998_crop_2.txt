gt_text: QUINCAILLERIE
vlm_output: QUINCAILLERIE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "QUINCAILLERIE" and the VLM OCR output is also "QUINCAILLERIE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they're exactly the same. Also, we have to consider unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is one word, "QUINCAILLERIE", and the OCR output is the same word, the unique words match perfectly.

They mentioned ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue here. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored, but there's no punctuation or extra spaces in either. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but here there are no typos. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect here. The answer should be 1.
