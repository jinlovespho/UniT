gt_text: HARVARD TRAINS BUSES
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HARVARD TRAINS BUSES". The OCR output from the VLM is "100%".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth words: "HARVARD", "TRAINS", "BUSES".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are HARVARD, TRAINS, BUSES. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of those words. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 — Partially correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: no words match or output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even when considering typos or case. The words in the ground truth are all proper nouns, and the OCR output is a number. There's no overlap. So according to the criteria, this would be category 3 because none of the words match and the output is unrelated.
