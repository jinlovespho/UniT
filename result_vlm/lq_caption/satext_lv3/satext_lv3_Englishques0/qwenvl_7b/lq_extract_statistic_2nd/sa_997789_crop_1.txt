gt_text: PONANT
vlm_output: PONANT

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PONANT" and the VLM OCR output is also "PONANT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "PONANT".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PONANT". The OCR output has the same word. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But both are uppercase and no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. There's no missing or extra words. So the answer should be 1.
