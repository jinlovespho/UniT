gt_text: UNO
vlm_output: UNO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNO" and the VLM OCR output is also "UNO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "UNO".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "UNO". The OCR output is also "UNO". Since they are identical, even if there were minor differences like case, but here they are the same. The unique words in ground truth are just "UNO", and the OCR output has that same word. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word here, and it's a perfect match, the category should be 1. There's no missing words, no typos, and everything aligns. So the answer is 1.
