gt_text: FOUR FOUR
vlm_output: 2004

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FOUR FOUR". The VLM OCR output is "2004". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "2004". 

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "FOUR" repeated twice. But the OCR output is "2004", which is a number. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique word here is "FOUR".

Next, I need to check if "2004" contains "FOUR" in any form. But "2004" is numbers, not letters. There's no 'F', 'O', 'U', 'R' in "2004". So even if we consider typos, "2004" doesn't look like "FOUR". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has no matching words, it should be category 3. But wait, maybe there's a typo? Like maybe "2004" is a typo for "FOUR"? But that seems a stretch. The OCR output is numbers, not letters. So no words match. Therefore, category 3.
