gt_text: ГАЗПРОМ APEHA
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ГАЗПРОМ APEHA" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just the number 100. Now, comparing this with the ground truth text. The ground truth has two words: "ГАЗПРОМ" and "APEHA". 

Next, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "ГАЗПРОМ" and "APEHA". The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the OCR output contains all unique ground truth words. However, "100" doesn't have either of those words. Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but since the OCR output is just numbers, there's no letters to compare. Small typos still count as matches, but there's no letters here to have typos. 

Since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth words, even partially, the category would be 3 — Incorrect. There's no overlap in words, and the output is unrelated. Even if I consider that maybe "100" could be a typo for something, but the ground truth words are in Russian and English, and "100" is a number. There's no way "100" can be considered as containing "ГАЗПРОМ" or "APEHA" even with typos. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
