vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PARIBAS BNP SAUF LIVRAISON ARRET INTERDIT ONS". The OCR output is "100".

First, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output here is "100", which is a number. The ground truth has words like PARIBAS, BNP, SAUF, LIVRAISON, ARRET, INTERDIT, ONS. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: PARIBAS, BNP, SAUF, LIVRAISON, ARRET, INTERDIT, ONS. The OCR output is "100", which is a number. None of the words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if we consider typos, "100" doesn't resemble any of the words. So there's no match. 

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3.
