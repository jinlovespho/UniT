gt_text: 911 EMERGENCY
vlm_output: 911

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "911 EMERGENCY" and the VLM OCR output is "911". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "911".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "911" and "EMERGENCY". 

Now, the OCR output is only "911". So, checking if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "911", which matches the first word. But "EMERGENCY" is missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since only one of the two unique words is present, this would fall under category 2—partially correct. 

I should also check if there are any typos or other factors. The OCR output is exactly "911", which is correct as per the ground truth's first word. No typos here. But since "EMERGENCY" isn't present, even though the OCR output is correct for part of it, it's not all. So category 2 is the right choice.
