gt_text: MARINE MARINE LA LA MARINE
vlm_output: 1024

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MARINE MARINE LA LA MARINE". The VLM OCR output is "1024". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1024", which is a number. But the ground truth is all words. So the OCR output is just numbers, not words.

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "MARINE" and "LA". The OCR output is "1024", which doesn't have any of those words. 

Now, considering the categories. Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. But here, the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it would fall into category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated or empty. Even though the OCR output isn't empty, it's just numbers, which don't match any of the words. So the answer should be 3.
