Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KLM" and the VLM OCR output is also "KLM". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "KLM", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "KLM".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are exactly the same. The ground truth has the words "KLM", and the OCR output has "KLM". Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). Since the OCR output exactly matches, all words (which is just "KLM") are present. So that's category 1.

Wait, but the ground truth is "KLM" which is a single word. The OCR output is the same. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is one word) are present. So it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
