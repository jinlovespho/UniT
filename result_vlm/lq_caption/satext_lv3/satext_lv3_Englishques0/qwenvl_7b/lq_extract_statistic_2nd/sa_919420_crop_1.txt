gt_text: KD
vlm_output: KD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KD" and the VLM OCR output is also "KD". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "KD", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are exactly "KD".

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two characters, "K" and "D". Wait, but are they considered as separate words or as a single word? The example might be a bit ambiguous here. However, since both the ground truth and OCR output are exactly "KD", it's likely treated as a single word. 

The instructions also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. Also, small typos are considered matches. However, there are no typos here since they are identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth is "KD" and the OCR output is "KD", all unique words (assuming "KD" is a single word) are present. Therefore, it should be Category 1.

Wait, but maybe the ground truth is considered as two separate words "K" and "D"? If that's the case, then the OCR output "KD" would be a single word, which might not match the two separate words. However, the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "KD" as a single word, then the OCR output matches exactly. If the ground truth is two separate words, then the OCR output is a single word, which would not match. But the original problem lists the ground truth as "KD" and the OCR output as "KD", so it's more likely that "KD" is considered as a single entity here. 

Given that, the answer should be Category 1.
