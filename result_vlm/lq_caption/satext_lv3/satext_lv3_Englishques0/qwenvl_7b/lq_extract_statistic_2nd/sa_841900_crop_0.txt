gt_text: San
vlm_output: San

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "San" and the VLM OCR output is also "San". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "San", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. The word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly "San", so order is the same.

Next, the comparison is based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "San". The OCR output also has "San". So, the unique words match here.

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, both the ground truth and OCR output are exactly "San" with no punctuation or spaces, so there's nothing to adjust here. 

Small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos in this case, the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "San" is the only unique word and it's present, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches perfectly with the ground truth according to all the given criteria. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
