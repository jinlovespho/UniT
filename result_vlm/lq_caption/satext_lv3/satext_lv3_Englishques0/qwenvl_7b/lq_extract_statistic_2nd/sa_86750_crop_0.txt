gt_text: D&G
vlm_output: D&G

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "D&G" and the VLM OCR output is also "D&G". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "D&G".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "D&G" since it's one word. The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a match. So the answer should be 1.
