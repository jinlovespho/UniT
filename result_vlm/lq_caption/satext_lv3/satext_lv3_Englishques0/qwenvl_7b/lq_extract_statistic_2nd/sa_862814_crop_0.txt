gt_text: HANC PETRAM AEDIFIC
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HANC PETRAM AEDIFIC", and the VLM OCR output says "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that there's no English text visible. So the extracted text is that sentence.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three Latin words: "HANC", "PETRAM", "AEDIFIC". The OCR output is in English and says there's no text. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So I need to check if any of those Latin words are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output mentions "English text" and doesn't include any of the Latin words. 

Even if I consider possible typos or variations, the OCR output doesn't have "HANC", "PETRAM", or "AEDIFIC". It's stating the absence of text, not providing any words. So none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and empty in terms of the actual words from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
