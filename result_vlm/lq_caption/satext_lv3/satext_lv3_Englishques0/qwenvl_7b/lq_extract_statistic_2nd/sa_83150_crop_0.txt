gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is just one word: "NIKE". The OCR output is the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. The unique words in the ground truth (which is just "NIKE") are all present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no possibility of partial matches here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
