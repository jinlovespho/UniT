gt_text: MAXI ZOO
vlm_output: MAXI ZOO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "MAXI ZOO" and a VLM OCR output "MAXI ZOO". They want me to determine the category based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "MAXI ZOO", which is the same as the ground truth. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. 

The ground truth has two words: "MAXI" and "ZOO". The OCR output has the same two words. Since the order doesn't matter, even if they were reversed, it would still be correct. Also, there's no difference in capitalization or spacing here. There are no typos either. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that means it's category 1: Correct. 

I should double-check if there's any reason to think it might be a different category. For example, if the OCR had "maxi zoo" with lowercase letters, but the problem says to ignore capitalization. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Therefore, the answer should be 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 4
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 4
