gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon". The OCR output also has "Nikon". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. There's no punctuation or spaces to consider. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

So all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "Nikon") are present in the OCR output. That means it meets category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
