gt_text: 30
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "30" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "30".

The instructions say to consider word order as not important, so that's not a factor here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "30". The OCR output has "100%". 

Now, I need to check if "100%" contains the unique words from the ground truth. But "100%" is a different number and has a percentage sign. The ground truth is just "30". Since the OCR output doesn't have "30" in it, even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "100%" doesn't match "30". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output.
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "30" isn't present in "100%", and there are no other words in the ground truth, the OCR output has none of the required words. So it should be category 3.
