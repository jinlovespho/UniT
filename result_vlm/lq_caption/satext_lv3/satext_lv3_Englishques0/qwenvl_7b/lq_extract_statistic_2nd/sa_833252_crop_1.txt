Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "easyJet".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

In this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are the same word: "easyJet". The ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output also has that same word. Even though there's no difference in the text, the conditions are met. Since all unique words (just "easyJet") are present, it should be category 1. There's no typo, no missing words, and the case is the same. So the answer should be 1.
