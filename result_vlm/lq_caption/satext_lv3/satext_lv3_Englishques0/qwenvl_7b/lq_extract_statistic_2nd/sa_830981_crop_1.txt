gt_text: 1099
vlm_output: EYELIKE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1099" and the VLM OCR output is "EYELIKE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "EYELIKE". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "1099". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth is a single number, "1099", which is four digits. The OCR output is the word "EYELIKE", which is seven letters. 

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "1099". The OCR output has "EYELIKE". 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, "1099" is a number, and "EYELIKE" is a word. There's no overlap in characters or words. Even if we consider typos, "EYELIKE" doesn't contain any digits. The ground truth is all numbers, and the OCR output is all letters. 

So, there's no matching word between the two. The category would be 3 because there's no match. Even if we check for typos, the OCR output doesn't have any digits. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
