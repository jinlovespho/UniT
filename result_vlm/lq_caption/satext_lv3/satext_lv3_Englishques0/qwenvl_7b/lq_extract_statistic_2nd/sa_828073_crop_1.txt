gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: DALIAN

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth. Then, compare them considering word order doesn't matter, but only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth has only one word: "DALIAN". The OCR output is the same word.

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "DALIAN". The OCR output has "DALIAN" as well. Ignoring case, but both are uppercase. There are no typos, extra spaces, or missing spaces. Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (exactly the same), that should be category 1. Even if there were a typo, like "Dalian" with lowercase 'l', but the instructions say small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos. So the answer is category 1.
