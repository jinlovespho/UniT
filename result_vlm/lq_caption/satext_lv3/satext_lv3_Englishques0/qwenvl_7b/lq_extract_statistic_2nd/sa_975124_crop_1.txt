gt_text: CA △BC
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the ground truth text is "CA △BC" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two based on specific rules.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth, considering certain factors. 

The ground truth has two parts: "CA" and "△BC". The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words here are "CA" and "△BC". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which isn't a word from the ground truth. The ground truth has "CA" and "△BC"—those are abbreviations or symbols. 

The rules also say that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output is entirely different. It's not even close to "CA" or "△BC". The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

So, according to the categories: category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one matches, but not all. But since there are no matches, it's category 3: incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the expected words.
