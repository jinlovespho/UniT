gt_text: BEACO
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BEACO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "BEACO". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has the word "BEACO". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. Since "100%" is a number and "BEACO" is a word, they don't seem related. There's no overlap in the words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "BEACO", and the OCR output has "100%", which is a different word. 

Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "BEACO" in any way. There's no part of the OCR output that matches any part of the ground truth word. Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since there are no matches here, it should be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible overlap. "100%" has numbers and a percent sign. The ground truth is letters only. So no letters in common. Therefore, no matches. So the answer is 3.
