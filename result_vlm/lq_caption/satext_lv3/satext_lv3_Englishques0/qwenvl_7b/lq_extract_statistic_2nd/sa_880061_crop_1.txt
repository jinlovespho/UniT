gt_text: garlando alfonso
vlm_output: alfonso garlando

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "garlando alfonso" and the VLM OCR output is "alfonso garlando". The task is to compare these two, considering that word order doesn't matter. So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done here as "alfonso garlando".

Next, I have to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "garlando" and "alfonso". The OCR output also has the same two words, just in reverse order. 

Now, checking the conditions: word order doesn't matter, so even though they're swapped, they're still the same words. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are lowercase here. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth, just reversed. Since the problem says that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So both words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. That should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. Even though the order is different, the category doesn't care about order. So the answer should be 1.
