gt_text: POLICE TW152 Raymarine SHORELINE
vlm_output: POLICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLICE TW152 Raymarine SHORELINE". The OCR output from the VLM is just "POLICE".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "POLICE".

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: POLICE, TW152, Raymarine, SHORELINE. So the unique words are those four. But the OCR only has "POLICE".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. So, even if the OCR had "police" (lowercase), that would still count as a match for "POLICE".

But the OCR output only has one word: POLICE. The ground truth has four unique words. Since the OCR output has at least one of them (POLICE), that would fall into category 2—partially correct. Because it's not all, but at least one matches. 

Wait, but the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR. Since the OCR only has one word, and the ground truth has four, it can't be category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. So that's the case here. The OCR has one match (POLICE) out of four. So the answer should be 2.

But wait, what if the OCR output had none? Then it's category 3. But here, there's one match. So category 2.
