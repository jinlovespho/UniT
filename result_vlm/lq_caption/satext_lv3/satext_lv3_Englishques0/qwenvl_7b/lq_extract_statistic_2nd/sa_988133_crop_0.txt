gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: UIT

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "UIT" and a VLM OCR output "UIT". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "UIT", which is already just text, so that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are exactly the same: "UIT". 

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word "UIT" (assuming it's a single word, maybe an acronym), and the OCR output has the same word, that matches perfectly. The criteria also mention ignoring case, spacing, and typos. Here, there are no differences in case or spacing, and no typos because they are identical. 

The other categories are for when there's a partial match or no match. Since everything matches here, the answer should be Category 1. I don't see any reason to consider it as partially correct or incorrect. Even if there were typos, like "uit" vs "UIT", the note says small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. So, definitely Category 1.
