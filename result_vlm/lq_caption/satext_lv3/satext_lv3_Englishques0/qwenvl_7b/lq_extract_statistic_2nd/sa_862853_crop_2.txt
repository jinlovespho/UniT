gt_text: JAGUAR

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "JAGUAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "JAGUAR". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "JAGUAR".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "JAGUAR".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

Looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "JAGUAR" and the ground truth is the same, this matches perfectly. So all unique words (just one) are present. 

So the answer should be category 1.
