gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: SHAKERS

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHAKERS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "SHAKERS".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHAKERS". The OCR output also has "SHAKERS". So the unique words match exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's fine.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1.
