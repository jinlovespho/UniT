gt_text: Tokyo Metro
vlm_output: Tokyo Metro

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Tokyo Metro" and the VLM OCR output is also "Tokyo Metro". The task is to compare them based on specific rules.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth. Then, comparing the words. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in reverse, it would still count. But here they are in the same order. 

Next, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Tokyo" and "Metro". The OCR output has the same two words. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized here. Also, no typos, so they match exactly. 

The categories are 1 if all unique words match. Since both words are present and correct, it should be category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if there were typos, like "Tokyo Metr" but the rules say small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. So definitely category 1.
