gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UBS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the numbers and a percentage sign.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "UBS", which is a proper noun, likely a company name. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UBS". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But "UBS" is all caps, and the OCR output is "10%", which is numbers and a symbol. There's no overlap in the words here. "10%" isn't a typo of "UBS" because they are completely different characters. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
