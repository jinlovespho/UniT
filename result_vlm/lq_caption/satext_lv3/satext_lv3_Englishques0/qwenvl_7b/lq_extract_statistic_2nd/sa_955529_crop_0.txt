gt_text: verbal
vlm_output: verbal

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "verbal" and the VLM OCR output is also "verbal". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "verbal", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word. 

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "verbal". The OCR output also has "verbal". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are lowercase and have no punctuation or extra spaces. 

Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos since both are exactly the same. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a match. 

So, the answer should be category 1.
