gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "EVERGREEN".

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "EVERGREEN". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth word is "EVERGREEN", which is a word meaning something that's always green, like a tree. The OCR output doesn't have any letters in common with "EVERGREEN". The letters in "100%" are 1, 0, 0, %, which are numbers and a symbol. There's no overlap in characters here. 

Also, the rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap at all. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of characters. So, the unique word in the ground truth ("EVERGREEN") is not present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since the OCR output has no words matching the ground truth, it should be category 3.

Wait, but maybe I should check if "100%" could be considered a typo or something. But "EVERGREEN" is a specific word. There's no way "100%" is a typo for that. They are completely different. So, no matches. Therefore, category 3.
