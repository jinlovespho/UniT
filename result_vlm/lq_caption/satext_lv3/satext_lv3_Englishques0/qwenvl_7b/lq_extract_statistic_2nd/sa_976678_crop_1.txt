gt_text: MERIDIANAS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MERIDIANAS" and the VLM OCR output is "SAILING". I need to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "SAILING".

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we only consider the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth is "MERIDIANAS". Let me break that down. The word is "MERIDIANAS". Wait, is that one word or two? The original says "MERIDIANAS" as a single string. But maybe it's a typo or a specific term. However, the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is a single word, then the set is just {"MERIDIANAS"}.

Now, the OCR output is "SAILING", which is a single word. The task is to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "MERIDIANAS", and the OCR output has "SAILING", there's no overlap. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "SAILING" and "MERIDIANAS" are completely different words. There's no typo here; they are unrelated. So even with typos, they don't match. Therefore, there are no matching words. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one word in the ground truth and it's not present, that's zero matches. So Category 3 is for no words matching or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
