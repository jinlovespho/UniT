gt_text: MOD PIZZA FAST SUPER
vlm_output: MOD PIZZA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MOD PIZZA FAST SUPER" and the VLM OCR output is "MOD PIZZA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "MOD PIZZA". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to ignore word order, so I can look at the words as sets. The ground truth has the words: MOD, PIZZA, FAST, SUPER. The OCR output has MOD and PIZZA. 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is missing FAST and SUPER. But the category 1 requires all unique words to be present. Since only two out of four are there, that's not category 1.

Category 2 is for at least one but not all. Here, two words match, which is more than one. So that fits category 2. 

Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. That's not the case here. 

I should also check for typos, but there are none in this case. The OCR output has exactly the words MOD and PIZZA, which are present in the ground truth. So the answer is category 2.
