gt_text: mossos d'esquadra policia
vlm_output: mossos d'esquadra

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "mossos d'esquadra policia" and the VLM OCR output is "mossos d'esquadra". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here: "mossos d'esquadra". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "mossos", "d'esquadra", and "policia". Wait, actually, splitting by spaces, the ground truth is three words: "mossos", "d'esquadra", "policia". The OCR output has two words: "mossos" and "d'esquadra".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are those three. The OCR output has two of them. But the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, "policia" is missing from the OCR output. 

But wait, the problem says "considering word order does NOT matter. Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So, if the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth, even if some are missing, but here the OCR is missing "policia". So, the OCR output has two of the three unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has two out of three, that's partially correct. So category 2. 

But wait, the OCR output is missing "policia", which is a unique word in the ground truth. So the OCR output doesn't have all, so category 2. 

I think that's right. The answer should be 2.
