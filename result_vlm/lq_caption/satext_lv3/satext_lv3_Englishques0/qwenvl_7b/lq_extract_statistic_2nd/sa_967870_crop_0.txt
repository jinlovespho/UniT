gt_text: CROWNE PLAZA
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CROWNE PLAZA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CROWNE" and "PLAZA". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. So, the words here are "100" and "%". Now, considering that we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. However, the ground truth words are "CROWNE" and "PLAZA", which are proper nouns, and the OCR output has numbers and a symbol. 

The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The words "100" and "%" don't match "CROWNE" or "PLAZA" even when ignoring case and punctuation. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is largely wrong and unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
