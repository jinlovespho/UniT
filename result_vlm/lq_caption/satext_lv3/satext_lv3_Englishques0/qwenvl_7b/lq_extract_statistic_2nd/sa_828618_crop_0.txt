gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BUT".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT". The OCR output also has "BUT". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small. But there are no typos here; it's exactly the same.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
