gt_text: ELEANOR ROSE
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "ELEANOR ROSE" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just a percentage. Then Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "ELEANOR" and "ROSE". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "10%", there's no mention of "ELEANOR" or "ROSE". The OCR output is a numerical value, not the names. Since the OCR output doesn't contain either of the unique words from the ground truth, even considering case, punctuation, or spacing, there's no match. Also, there's no typo here because "10%" isn't a typo of either word. It's just unrelated text.

According to the categories, Category 1 is correct if all unique words from the ground truth are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since neither word is present, it's not partially correct. Therefore, it falls under Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be 3.
