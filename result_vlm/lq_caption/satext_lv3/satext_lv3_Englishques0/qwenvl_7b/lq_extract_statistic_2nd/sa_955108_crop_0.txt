gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth.

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are just "NIKE", the order is the same. They also say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
