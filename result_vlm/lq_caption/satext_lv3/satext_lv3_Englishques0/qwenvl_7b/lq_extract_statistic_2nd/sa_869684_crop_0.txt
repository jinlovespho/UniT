gt_text: GIORGIO ARMANI
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GIORGIO ARMANI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "GIORGIO" and "ARMANI". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "100%" doesn't contain either "GIORGIO" or "ARMANI". Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, there's no match here. The OCR output is a number, not the brand names. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "100%" has none of the words from the ground truth, it falls into category 3. 

I should make sure there's no typo or alternative interpretation. But "100%" is clearly not related to the names provided. So the answer is 3.
