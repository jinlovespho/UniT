gt_text: ZONE NO FLY
vlm_output: NO FLY ZONE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth is "ZONE NO FLY" and the VLM OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NO FLY ZONE". Then, step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "ZONE", "NO", and "FLY". 

Now, the OCR output has "NO", "FLY", and "ZONE" as well. The order is different, but since the problem states that word order doesn't matter, that's not an issue. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Both the ground truth and OCR output are all uppercase, so that's consistent. There are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth, just in a different order. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since all three words are present in both, even though the order is different, the answer should be category 1. The small typos are mentioned as still counting as matches, but there are no typos here. So it's a perfect match in terms of words, just reordered. Therefore, the correct category is 1.
