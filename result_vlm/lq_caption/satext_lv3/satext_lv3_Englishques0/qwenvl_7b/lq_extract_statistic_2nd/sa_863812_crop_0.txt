gt_text: 1 1

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1 1", and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "1".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of the word "1", but since the instructions say to consider the set of unique words, I should focus on unique elements. The unique word in the ground truth is just "1". 

The OCR output has "1" as well. Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, so even if there were multiple instances, the uniqueness is what's important. Also, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. Since both are just "1", there's no issue there. Typos aren't a factor here because there's only one word.

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be correct.
