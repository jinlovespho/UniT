gt_text: PARKING RESERVED 142 E
vlm_output: 142 E

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PARKING RESERVED 142 E" and the VLM OCR output is "142 E". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here: "142 E".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "PARKING", "RESERVED", "142", and "E". But wait, the OCR output only has "142" and "E". 

Now, considering that we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output has "142" and "E", which are both present in the ground truth. However, the ground truth has two more words: "PARKING" and "RESERVED". The OCR output doesn't include these. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none or largely wrong.

In this case, the OCR output has two of the four unique words. So, it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.
