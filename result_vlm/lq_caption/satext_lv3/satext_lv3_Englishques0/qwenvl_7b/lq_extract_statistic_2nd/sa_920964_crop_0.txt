gt_text: LISTA WILSON
vlm_output: BELMUNTA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LISTA WILSON" and the VLM OCR output is "BELMUNTA". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "BELMUNTA". Now, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is "LISTA WILSON". 

The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

1. **Word order does not matter.** So, even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
2. **Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.** The ground truth has two words: "LISTA" and "WILSON".
3. **Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.** So, case doesn't matter, and spaces are irrelevant.
4. **Small typos still count as matches.** So, if a word is slightly misspelled, it's considered a match.

Now, the categories are:

- **1 — Correct:** All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
- **2 — Slightly correct:** At least one but not all unique words match.
- **3 — Incorrect:** No words match, or the output is unrelated/empty.

Let's apply this. The ground truth words are "LISTA" and "WILSON". The OCR output is "BELMUNTA". Let's check if either of these words is present in the OCR output, considering possible typos and ignoring case.

First, check "LISTA" against "BELMUNTA". "LISTA" is a 5-letter word. "BELMUNTA" is 8 letters. No obvious match here. What about "WILSON"? "WILSON" is 6 letters. "BELMUNTA" is 8 letters again. No direct match.

But maybe there are typos. Let me think. For example, could "BELMUNTA" be a misspelling of "WILSON"? Let's see. "BELMUNTA" has letters B, E, L, M, U, N, T, A. "WILSON" is W, I, L, S, O, N. Not really similar. "LISTA" is L, I, S, T, A. "BELMUNTA" has L, but the rest don't match. 

Alternatively, maybe "BELMUNTA" is a combination of parts of the ground truth words. But the rules state that we need to match the unique words from the ground truth. Since "BELMUNTA" doesn't contain "LISTA" or "WILSON" even with typos, it seems like neither word is present.

Wait, but the OCR output is a single word "BELMUNTA", whereas the ground truth has two words. However, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, we need to check if each of "LISTA" and "WILSON" is present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output is one word, and neither "LISTA" nor "WILSON" are present (even with typos), then there are zero matches. Therefore, the category would be 3 — Incorrect.
