Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "in", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "in".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "in". Now, the comparison criteria are a bit specific. Let me break them down.

First, word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and single word. So no issues there. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. So the answer should be 1.
