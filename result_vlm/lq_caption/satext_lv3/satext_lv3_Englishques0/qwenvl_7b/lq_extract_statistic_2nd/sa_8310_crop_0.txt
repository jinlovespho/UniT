gt_text: DEVEREUX
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DEVEREUX" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison.
- We only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "DEVEREUX", which is a single word. So the unique words set is {"DEVEREUX"}.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "100%", which has numbers and a percent sign. The ground truth is all caps, but the OCR output is lowercase numbers. However, the problem says to ignore capitalization, but here the OCR output isn't even letters. Wait, but the ground truth is a name, which is letters, and the OCR output is numbers. So maybe there's no overlap here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output is entirely different characters (numbers vs letters). So no typos here, just a complete mismatch.

Now, looking at the categories:

Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. The ground truth has "DEVEREUX". The OCR output is "100%", which has no letters, just numbers. So no match here.

Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, this category doesn't apply either.

Category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" has no letters and the ground truth is a name, there's no match. The OCR output is unrelated (numbers vs a name), so this falls into category 3.

I think that's it. The answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 8
2. Slightly Correct Num: 2
3. Incorrect Num: 13
