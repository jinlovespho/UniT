gt_text: STATUE CRUISES
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STATUE CRUISES" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which has two words: "STATUE" and "CRUISES".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the OCR output here is "100%", which doesn't contain either of the words from the ground truth. There's no mention of "statue" or "cruises" in the OCR result. The percentage is a number, not related to the words in the ground truth.

Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble either word. Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since "100%" has no matching words, the category should be 3. The OCR output is entirely unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 28
2. Slightly Correct Num: 12
3. Incorrect Num: 46
