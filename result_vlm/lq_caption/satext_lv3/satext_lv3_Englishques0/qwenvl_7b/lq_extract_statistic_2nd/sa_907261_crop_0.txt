gt_text: AMP701 AMP701
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMP701 AMP701", and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of "AMP701". But the OCR output is "100". Let's break down the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, the OCR output has only one word, "100", while the ground truth has two words, both "AMP701".
- We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique word here is "AMP701".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, "100" is a number, and "AMP701" is a string with letters and numbers. There's no direct match here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But "100" isn't a typo of "AMP701"; they are entirely different. Even if there were a typo, like "AMP701" vs "AMP701" (same), but here it's "100".

So, the OCR output doesn't contain the word "AMP701" at all. It's a completely different number. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words are present. Not the case here.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But there's no match here.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is wrong. This fits.

So the answer should be 3.
