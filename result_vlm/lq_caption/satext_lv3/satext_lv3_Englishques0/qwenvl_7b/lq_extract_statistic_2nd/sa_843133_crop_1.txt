Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "3" and the VLM OCR output is also "3". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "3", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "3". The OCR output also has "3". 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation involved. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because both are the same.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, all unique words (which is just "3") are present. Therefore, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
