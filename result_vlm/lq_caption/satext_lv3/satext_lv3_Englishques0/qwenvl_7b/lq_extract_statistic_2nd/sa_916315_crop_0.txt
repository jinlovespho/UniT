gt_text: WOW air
vlm_output: WOW

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "WOW air" and the VLM OCR output is "WOW". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "WOW".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two words: "WOW" and "air". The OCR output has only "WOW". 

But the categories are based on unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "WOW" and "air". The OCR output has "WOW" which matches one of them. The other word "air" isn't present in the OCR output. 

The rules say that if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since "WOW" is a match but "air" isn't, that would be partially correct. So the answer should be category 2.
