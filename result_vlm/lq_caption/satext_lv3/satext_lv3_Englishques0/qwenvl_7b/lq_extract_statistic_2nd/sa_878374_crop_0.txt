gt_text: ROW MARMONT
vlm_output: 1904

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth is "ROW MARMONT" and the OCR output is "1904". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "1904".

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "ROW" and "MARMONT". 

Now, the OCR output is "1904", which is a number. The ground truth words are all letters. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but the OCR output here is just numbers. There's no overlap in words between "1904" and "ROW MARMONT". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "1904" doesn't contain "ROW" or "MARMONT" in any form (even considering typos, but they're numbers vs. letters), there's no match. So the answer should be category 3.
