gt_text: RATHAUS
vlm_output: 1903

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RATHAUS" and the VLM OCR output is "1903". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1903", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "RATHAUS", which is a word, probably a proper noun like a building name. 

Now step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is "1903", which is numbers, not words. The ground truth has one unique word: "RATHAUS". 

The problem mentions comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has no words (it's numbers), there's no overlap. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but here the OCR output isn't even a word. So there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "1903" doesn't contain "RATHAUS" or any of its letters (assuming the OCR output is supposed to be text), it's unrelated. So the category should be 3.
