gt_text: TOKYO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOKYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "TOKYO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "TOKYO", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "TOKYO".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly "TOKYO", same capitalization, no typos, no extra spaces.

The categories are 1, 2, or 3. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Since the ground truth is "TOKYO", which is one word, and the OCR output has "TOKYO" as well, that's a match. Even if there were typos, like "Tokyo" with lowercase 'k' or something, it would still count as a match because of the small typos rule. But here, they are exactly the same. So all unique words (just "TOKYO") are present. Therefore, it's category 1.

Wait, but the ground truth is "TOKYO" and the OCR output is "TOKYO". So the unique words in ground truth are {"TOKYO"} (case-insensitive?), but the comparison is case-insensitive? Wait, the instructions say to ignore capitalization. So even if the OCR output was "tokyo", it would still match. But here, both are uppercase. However, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "TOKYO" as a single word. The OCR output has "TOKYO" as the same word. So all unique words from ground truth are present. Therefore, category 1. So the answer is 1.
