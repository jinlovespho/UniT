gt_text: XIV SEC.
vlm_output: France

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "XIV SEC." and the VLM OCR output is "France". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "France", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has the words "XIV" and "SEC." (though "SEC" might be short for something like "section" or "security"). The OCR output is "France", which is a single word.

Now, looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "XIV" and "SEC." (assuming "SEC." is considered a single word here, maybe with the period). The OCR output has "France", which is a different word. There's no overlap in the words. Even if I consider typos, "France" doesn't resemble "XIV" or "SEC" in any way. Capitalization and spacing aren't an issue here since both are single words, but the content is entirely different.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since there are no matching words between "France" and "XIV SEC.", the category should be 3.
