gt_text: COTTAGE MINT
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "COTTAGE MINT". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth text.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "COTTAGE" and "MINT". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. So, the extracted text is "100%". Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "100%", there's no mention of "COTTAGE" or "MINT". The words are completely different. The OCR output is a number with a percentage sign, which doesn't relate to the words in the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one but not all match (but there are no matches), and 3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain either "COTTAGE" or "MINT", and it's unrelated, this would be category 3.
