gt_text: GENTILE IMO
vlm_output: GENTILE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GENTILE IMO" and the OCR output is "GENTILE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "GENTILE".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "GENTILE" and "IMO". The OCR output only has "GENTILE". The instructions say to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "GENTILE" and "IMO".

The OCR output has "GENTILE", which matches one of the ground truth words. The other word, "IMO", isn't present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since there are two unique words in the ground truth and only one is matched, that would be category 2. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here, just a missing word. So the answer should be 2.
