gt_text: OZON
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OZON" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". Now, comparing this to the ground truth "OZON". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OZON". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "OZON", and the OCR output has "100%". Are there any overlapping words? "OZON" is a four-letter word, and "100%" is numbers and a symbol. They don't share any common words. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "OZON" is a proper noun, maybe a brand or a name, and "100%" is a percentage. They don't seem related. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "OZON" in any way. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth and it's not in the OCR output, that would be zero matches. Therefore, it falls into Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
