gt_text: EESTI VABADUSSÖDA 1918 1920
vlm_output: ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EESTI VABADUSSÖDA 1918 1920". The OCR output from VLM is "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward: "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "EESTI", "VABADUSSÖDA", "1918", "1920". The OCR output has "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE".

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, only unique words from the ground truth. Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and typos. But small typos still count as matches.

So, looking at the OCR words: "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE". The ground truth words are "EESTI", "VABADUSSÖDA", "1918", "1920". None of the OCR words match any of the ground truth words. Even if I consider possible typos, like maybe "VANDERNYDE" could be a misspelling of "VABADUSSÖDA"? But that seems like a stretch. "VABADUSSÖDA" is a proper noun, probably a name or a term specific to the context, like "Estonian Independence" maybe? The OCR output has "ALEXANDER" which is a name, and "VANDERNYDE" which might be a surname, but neither of these seem related to the ground truth words. The numbers 1918 and 1920 are in the ground truth, but the OCR output doesn't have any numbers.

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is unrelated.
