gt_text: PayPal
vlm_output: PayPal

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PayPal" and the VLM OCR output is also "PayPal". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to the comparison step. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PayPal". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, checking for case, punctuation, and spaces. The original is "PayPal" and the OCR output is "PayPal" as well. So capitalization is the same, no extra spaces or punctuation. The typos part mentions that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word), it should fall under category 1. There's no missing words, and the only word is present. Even if there were a typo, it would still count as correct. But here, it's exact. So the answer should be 1.
