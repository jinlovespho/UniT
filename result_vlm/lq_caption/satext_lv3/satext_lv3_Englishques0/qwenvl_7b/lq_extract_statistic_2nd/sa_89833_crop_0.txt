gt_text: BREST PLACE DE
vlm_output: The text in the image is not fully legible, but it appears to be a series of numbers and letters that could be part of a code or a specific message. If you have any additional context or if the image is meant to convey a particular meaning, please provide more details so I can assist you better.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BREST PLACE DE". The VLM OCR output says that the text is not fully legible and mentions numbers and letters possibly being part of a code or message. But the user wants me to check if the OCR output's extracted text matches the ground truth based on certain criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a description of the image, not the actual text. The OCR didn't recognize the text as "BREST PLACE DE" but instead described it as numbers and letters that could be a code. So, the extracted text from the OCR output is not the actual words "BREST", "PLACE", "DE", but rather a statement about the text being illegible.

Now, step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "BREST", "PLACE", "DE". The OCR output doesn't have any of these words. It's talking about numbers and letters, which are not the same as the words in the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since the OCR output doesn't mention any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos, case, etc., it's not matching. The OCR output is completely different. So the category should be 3.
