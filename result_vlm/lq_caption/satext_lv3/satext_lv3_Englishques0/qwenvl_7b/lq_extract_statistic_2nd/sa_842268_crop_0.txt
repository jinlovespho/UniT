gt_text: Ingeborg STOCKHOLM
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "Ingeborg STOCKHOLM", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. 

Now, step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Ingeborg" and "STOCKHOLM". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Looking at the OCR output, "100%" doesn't contain either "Ingeborg" or "STOCKHOLM". There's no overlap in words. Even if we consider typos or case, "100%" isn't a typo of either word. It's a completely different type of data—numeric instead of names. So according to category 3, which is for no matches or unrelated outputs, this should be category 3.
