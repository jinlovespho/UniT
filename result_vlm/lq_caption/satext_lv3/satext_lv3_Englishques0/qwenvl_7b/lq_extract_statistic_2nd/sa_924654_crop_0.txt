gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: RESTAURACJA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "RESTAURACJA". The OCR output has the same word. 

I need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since they are the same, all unique words (just one) are present. Also, ignoring case, but both are uppercase. No typos, so that's fine. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique words match. There's no missing or extra words. The answer should be 1.
