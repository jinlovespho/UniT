gt_text: FASHION
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FASHION" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "FASHION", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, considering the comparison criteria. The unique words in the ground truth are just "FASHION". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word "FASHION". Even if we ignore punctuation, "100" is a number, not the word. There's no mention of "FASHION" in the OCR output. 

The rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo of "FASHION" in the OCR output. The OCR output is entirely different. Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "FASHION"), this would fall under category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty."

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible overlap. For example, if "100%" could be considered a typo for "FASHION", but that seems like a stretch. The OCR output is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a word. There's no overlap in the words. Therefore, category 3 applies.
