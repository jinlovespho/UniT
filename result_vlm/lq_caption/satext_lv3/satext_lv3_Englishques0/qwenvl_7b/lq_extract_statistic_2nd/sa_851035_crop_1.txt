gt_text: HS-TXO
vlm_output: 1974

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "HS-TXO" and the VLM OCR output is "1974". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1974", which is straightforward. Now, step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. Let's break down the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. So, even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "HS-TXO" as a single word, right? Wait, but maybe I should split it into individual characters or parts? Wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth." So "HS-TXO" is considered one word. The OCR output is "1974", which is a four-digit number. 

Now, considering the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But the ground truth is "HS-TXO" which has a hyphen and uppercase letters. The OCR output is all numbers. So, the OCR output doesn't have any letters, just numbers. The ground truth has letters and a hyphen. 

The rules say that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is entirely different in terms of characters. The ground truth words are "HS-TXO" (assuming that's one word), and the OCR output is "1974". There's no overlap in characters. The OCR output has digits, the ground truth has letters and a hyphen. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But the OCR output has no letters, so "HS-TXO" isn't present. 
2 — Slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But again, the OCR output has none of the letters from the ground truth. 
3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So, since the OCR output has no matching characters to the ground truth word "HS-TXO", it's category 3. The answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 39
2. Slightly Correct Num: 21
3. Incorrect Num: 86
