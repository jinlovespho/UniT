Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "724" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already "1970". Then, compare it with the ground truth "724". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "724", which is a single number. So the unique words here are just "724".

But the OCR output is "1970", which is another number. Now, the categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. However, "724" and "1970" are different numbers. Are they considered as words here? Since they're numeric, but the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and typos. But numbers are case-insensitive by nature. However, the OCR output doesn't have "724" in it. It has "1970", which is a different number. 

So the unique word in ground truth is "724". The OCR output has "1970", which is a different number. Since there's no match for "724" in the OCR output, that would mean no words match. According to category 3, that's when no words match or the output is unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the unique words part. The ground truth is "724", which is one word. The OCR output is "1970", which is another word. Since they are different, there's no match. So category 3 applies here. So the answer is 3.
