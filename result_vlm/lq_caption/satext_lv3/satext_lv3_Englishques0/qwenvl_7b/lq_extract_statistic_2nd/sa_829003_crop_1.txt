gt_text: EMPLOYEES ONLY

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES ONLY" and the VLM OCR output is "1025". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1025", which is a number. But the ground truth is text, specifically two words: "EMPLOYEES" and "ONLY". 

Now, moving to Step 2, the comparison criteria. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output here is "1025", which is a number, not any text words.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. The ground truth has "EMPLOYEES" and "ONLY". The OCR output has "1025", which are digits, not words. There's no overlap here. 

Category 2 is for at least one but not all words matching. But again, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. It's just numbers. 

Category 3 is for no words matching or the output being unrelated. Since "1025" is a number and not related to the words in the ground truth, this falls under Category 3. 

I should also check if there's any possible way the OCR could have misread numbers as letters. For example, "1025" might be interpreted as "IO25" or similar, but even then, that doesn't match "EMPLOYEES" or "ONLY". There's no overlap in letters or words. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 3.
