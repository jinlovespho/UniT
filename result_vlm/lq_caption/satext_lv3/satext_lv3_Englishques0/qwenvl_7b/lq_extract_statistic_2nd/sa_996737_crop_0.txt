gt_text: STREET EBURY SW1 CITY OF WESTMINSTER
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "STREET EBURY SW1 CITY OF WESTMINSTER" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Then Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth into its unique words. The ground truth text is "STREET EBURY SW1 CITY OF WESTMINSTER". Let's split that into individual words: STREET, EBURY, SW1, CITY, OF, WESTMINSTER. So those are the unique words. Now, the OCR output is "100%". 

Comparing "100%" with the ground truth words. The OCR output has the words "100" and "%" (though maybe the percentage sign is considered punctuation here). But looking at the unique words in the ground truth, none of them are "100" or "%". The ground truth words are all proper nouns or parts of an address. 

The criteria say that we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, if the OCR output has none of those words, even considering typos, then it would fall into category 3. However, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

Wait, maybe I should check if any of the OCR output words could be a typo for any of the ground truth words. For example, "100" could be a typo for "STREET"? But "100" is a number, and "STREET" is a word. They don't seem related. Similarly, "%" is a symbol, not a word. So there's no overlap here. 

Therefore, since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, even after considering possible typos, it would be categorized as 3 — Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words in the ground truth. Even if we consider that maybe "100%" is a typo for something else, but there's no way that "100%" would be a typo for any of the words in the ground truth. 

So the answer should be category 3.
