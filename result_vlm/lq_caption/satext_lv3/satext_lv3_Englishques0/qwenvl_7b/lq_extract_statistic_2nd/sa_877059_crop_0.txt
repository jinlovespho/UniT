gt_text: Museum South 525 State Art of
vlm_output: Museum of Art

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Museum South 525 State Art of" and the VLM OCR output is "Museum of Art". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "Museum of Art". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into words: "Museum", "South", "525", "State", "Art", "of". So the unique words are Museum, South, 525, State, Art, of.

Now, the OCR output has "Museum", "of", "Art". Comparing these to the ground truth's unique words. The OCR has Museum, Art, of. The ground truth has those three plus South, 525, State. 

So, the OCR output includes three of the six unique words from the ground truth. But according to the categories, category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only three out of six are present. But wait, the instructions say "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So, the OCR output must have all the unique words from the ground truth, but in this case, it's missing South, 525, State. 

But the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR. Since the OCR is missing three words, it's not category 1. Then category 2 is if at least one but not all. The OCR has three words that match (Museum, Art, of), which are part of the ground truth's unique words. So that's at least one, but not all. So category 2. 

Wait, but the OCR output has three words, and the ground truth has six. But the OCR has three of the six. So that's partially correct. So category 2. 

But wait, the instructions say "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has six unique words. The OCR output has three words, all of which are present in the ground truth. So that's at least one, but not all. Hence, category 2. 

I think that's right. So the answer is 2.
