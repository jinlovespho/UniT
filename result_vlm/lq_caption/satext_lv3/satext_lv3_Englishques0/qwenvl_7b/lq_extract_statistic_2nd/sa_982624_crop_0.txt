gt_text: THIRD FIFTH
vlm_output: FIFTH THIRD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "THIRD FIFTH" and the VLM OCR output is "FIFTH THIRD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "FIFTH THIRD". Now, comparing this with the ground truth, which is "THIRD FIFTH". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed in the OCR output, that shouldn't affect the comparison. Next, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "THIRD" and "FIFTH". Both of these words are present in the OCR output, just in reverse order. 

I also need to ignore capitalization, but both the ground truth and OCR output are in uppercase, so that's not an issue here. There are no punctuation marks or extra spaces to worry about. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth, just swapped. 

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case. Both words are spelled correctly. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct. The key point here is that the set of words matches exactly, regardless of order. So the answer is category 1.
