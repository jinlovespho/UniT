gt_text: GIRONA
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GIRONA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is just "100%". 

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "GIRONA", which is a proper noun, likely a place name. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "GIRONA". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "100%" is a number, not a word. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "GIRONA" is a word and the OCR output has no words (it's a number), there's no match. 

Also, small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no word at all. The OCR output is unrelated. 

Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since "100%" doesn't contain "GIRONA" in any form, even ignoring case or spacing, the answer should be category 3.
