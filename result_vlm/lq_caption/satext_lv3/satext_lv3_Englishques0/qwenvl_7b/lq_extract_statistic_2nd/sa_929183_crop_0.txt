gt_text: EQUINOX 3567
vlm_output: 10% OFF

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EQUINOX 3567" and the VLM OCR output is "10% OFF". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here: "10% OFF". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "EQUINOX" and "3567". The OCR output has "10%", "OFF". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words match. Let's look at each word. "EQUINOX" vs "10%", "OFF" – no match. "3567" vs "10%", "OFF" – also no match. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But "10%" has a percentage symbol, which isn't in the ground truth. "OFF" is a word, but the ground truth has "EQUINOX" and "3567". Even if we consider typos, "OFF" doesn't resemble "EQUINOX" or "3567". 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 – Incorrect.
