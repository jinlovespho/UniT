gt_text: Welcome
vlm_output: 1972

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Welcome" and the VLM OCR output is "1972". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps and criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1972", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "Welcome".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "Welcome". The OCR output is "1972", which is numbers. There's no overlap in words here. The OCR output doesn't have the word "Welcome" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "1972" isn't a typo of "Welcome". They are entirely different types of characters—letters vs. numbers. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, the OCR output has none of the words from the ground truth. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's no match here, it's not Category 2. Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1972" is unrelated to "Welcome" and there's no matching word, this should be Category 3.
