gt_text: OCBC Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OCBC Bank" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to determine the category based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. 

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "OCBC" and "Bank". The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "100", which is numerical. The ground truth words are "OCBC" (which is a bank's name) and "Bank". 

The OCR output doesn't have any of these words. The numbers "100" don't match "OCBC" or "Bank" even if we consider typos or ignore case. Since there's no overlap in the words, even considering possible typos, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. 

Looking at the categories: Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100" is unrelated to "OCBC Bank" and there are no matching words, the correct category should be 3.
