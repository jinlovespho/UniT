gt_text: Wolt

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Wolt" and the VLM OCR output is also "Wolt". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Wolt", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Wolt".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Wolt". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase? Wait, the ground truth is "Wolt" and the OCR output is also "Wolt". So same case. But even if there was a difference in case, like "wolt" vs "Wolt", it would still count as a match because capitalization is ignored. Also, there are no extra spaces or punctuation here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

The categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word, and it's present, that's category 1. There are no typos here, but even if there were small typos, they still count as matches. So this is a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
