gt_text: PRAXAIR

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "PRAXAIR" and the VLM OCR output is also "PRAXAIR". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "PRAXAIR".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are the same word, "PRAXAIR", and they're exactly matching. 

The ground truth has one unique word, "PRAXAIR". The OCR output also has the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor differences, but here there are none. So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. 

I need to check if there's any reason to think it might not be category 1. But since the OCR output matches exactly, and there's only one word, it's definitely category 1. No typos, no missing words, no extra words. So the answer should be 1.
