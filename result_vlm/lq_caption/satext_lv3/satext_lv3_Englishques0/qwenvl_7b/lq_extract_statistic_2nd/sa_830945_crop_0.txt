Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "HYBRID4", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both texts are the same.

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HYBRID4". The OCR output also has the same word. So, checking if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since they are exactly the same, all unique words (just one here) are present.

Other factors to ignore include capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, there's no punctuation, and the spacing is the same (no spaces at all). Also, small typos are considered matches. But there are no typos here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
