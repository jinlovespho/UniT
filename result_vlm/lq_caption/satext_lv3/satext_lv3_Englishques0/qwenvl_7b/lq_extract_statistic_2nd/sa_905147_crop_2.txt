gt_text: NOTHING
vlm_output: NOTHING

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NOTHING" and the VLM OCR output is also "NOTHING". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NOTHING".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "NOTHING". The OCR output is the same word. So when we compare, ignoring case, even if the OCR had "nothing" in lowercase, it would still match. But here, both are uppercase. So the words are identical.

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word, and it's present exactly as is, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, and the output isn't empty. So the answer should be 1.
