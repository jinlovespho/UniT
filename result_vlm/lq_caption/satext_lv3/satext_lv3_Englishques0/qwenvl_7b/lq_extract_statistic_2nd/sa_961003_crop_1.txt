gt_text: REIMS
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "REIMS" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth is "REIMS". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "REIMS" since it's a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

Now, checking if there's any overlap. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. The ground truth is a proper noun, a city name. There's no overlap in words here. Even if we ignore case, "reims" vs "100%" still don't match. The OCR output doesn't have the word "REIMS" or any variation that's close enough considering typos. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no match here, it falls under category 3. The OCR output is entirely different and unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
