gt_text: 60
vlm_output: No Parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "60", and the VLM OCR output is "No Parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "No Parking". Then, I compare this with the ground truth, which is just "60". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "60". The OCR output has two words: "No" and "Parking". 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. The ground truth word is "60", which is a number. The OCR output has "No" and "Parking", which are words, not numbers. There's no mention of "60" in the OCR output. 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but the unique words in the ground truth must be present. Since "60" isn't in the OCR output, there's no match. Also, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. So according to the categories, this would be category 3 — Incorrect, because no words match and the output is unrelated.
