gt_text: Dior CONGRATULATIONS
vlm_output: CONGRATULATIONS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Dior CONGRATULATIONS" and the VLM OCR output is "CONGRATULATIONS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "CONGRATULATIONS". 

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output has only "CONGRATULATIONS". 

The instructions say to consider word order as not important. So even if the order was different, it wouldn't matter. But here, the OCR is missing "Dior" entirely. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output has "CONGRATULATIONS" but not "Dior". So only one of the two unique words is present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since only one word matches, it's category 2. 

I should check if there are any typos or case issues, but "CONGRATULATIONS" is exactly as in the ground truth. The missing word is "Dior", which isn't present. So the answer should be 2.
