Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "36 36 36" and the VLM OCR output is "47". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "47", which is a single number.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three instances of "36". The unique word here is "36" since all are the same. The OCR output is "47", which is a different number. 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "36", and the OCR output has "47". There's no match here. Even if we consider typos, "47" isn't a typo of "36" because they are different numbers. The OCR output doesn't contain "36" at all. 

So, according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it should be category 3. The output is entirely wrong and unrelated. Even if there was a typo, like if it was "37", that might be considered a small typo, but "47" is not close enough. Therefore, the answer is 3.
