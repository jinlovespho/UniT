gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: Duty

----------------------------

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Duty" and the VLM OCR output is also "Duty". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "Duty", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Duty". The OCR output also has "Duty". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (both start with uppercase D), no punctuation, and no extra spaces. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's a Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
