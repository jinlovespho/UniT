Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ANELLO" and the VLM OCR output is also "ANELLO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "ANELLO", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the ground truth.

Step 2 is comparing them with specific considerations. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are single words. So order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ANELLO". The OCR output also has "ANELLO". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. So they match exactly. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just one) are present. So this should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
