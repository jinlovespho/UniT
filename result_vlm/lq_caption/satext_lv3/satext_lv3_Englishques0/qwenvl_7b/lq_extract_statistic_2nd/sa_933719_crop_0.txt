gt_text: Long
vlm_output: Long

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Long" and the VLM OCR output is also "Long". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Long".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Long". The OCR output is "Long" as well. So, when we compare, ignoring case, spacing, etc., they are exactly the same. Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Long") are present in the OCR output, that should be category 1.

Wait, but what if there's a typo? The example here has no typos. So it's a perfect match. Therefore, category 1 applies here. There's no missing words or extra words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth when considering the given factors. So the answer should be 1.
