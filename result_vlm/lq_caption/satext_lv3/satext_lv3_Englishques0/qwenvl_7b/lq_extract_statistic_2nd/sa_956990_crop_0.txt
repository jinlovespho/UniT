gt_text: Steelers
vlm_output: Steelers

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Steelers" and the VLM OCR output is also "Steelers". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Steelers".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Steelers". The OCR output also has "Steelers". So they match exactly. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But since both are the same word, none of those factors come into play here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "Steelers" is present in both, and there's only one unique word, this should be a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
