gt_text: AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD
vlm_output: ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD" and the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Then, I have to compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, I need to consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER", "ETIHAD". 

Now, the OCR output is all one word: "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". But maybe the OCR merged them into one word. However, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, I need to check if the OCR output contains all those words, regardless of order, case, spacing, and typos.

Breaking down the OCR output: "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". If I split it into possible words, maybe "ETIHAD", "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER". Let's see: "ETIHAD" is part of the OCR output. Then "AIRWAYS" is there as well, since "AIRWAYS" is in the middle. "PARTNER" is at the end. So all three words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though they are merged into one string. The rules say to ignore spacing and extra/missing spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if they are small. Here, there's no typo, just the words are concatenated without spaces. 

So, all three unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
