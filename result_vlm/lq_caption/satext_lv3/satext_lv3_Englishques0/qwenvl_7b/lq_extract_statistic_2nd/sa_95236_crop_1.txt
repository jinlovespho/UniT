gt_text: TADANO ZE500
vlm_output: TADANO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "TADANO ZE500" and the OCR output is "TADANO". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "TADANO". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has two words: "TADANO" and "ZE500". The OCR output has only "TADANO". 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter. So I should check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But the OCR output is missing "ZE500". 

Wait, the categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. 

So here, the OCR has one of the two words. So that would be category 2, slightly correct. But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo, just a missing word. 

So since "TADANO" is present (exact match, ignoring case and spacing), and "ZE500" is missing, the OCR output has at least one but not all unique words. Therefore, category 2.
