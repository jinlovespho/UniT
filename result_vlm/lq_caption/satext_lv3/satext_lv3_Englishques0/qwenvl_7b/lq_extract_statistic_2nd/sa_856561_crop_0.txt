Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "E760 E760 E760", and the VLM OCR output is "1975". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1975", which is straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, the unique words are just "E760" since it's repeated three times. The OCR output is "1975". Now, I need to check if "1975" matches "E760" under the given conditions. 

But wait, "1975" is a number, while "E760" is a alphanumeric string. The problem says to ignore capitalization, but "E760" starts with a capital E, and "1975" is all numbers. However, the instruction also mentions that small typos still count as matches. However, "1975" and "E760" are not typos of each other. They are entirely different strings. There's no overlap in characters or structure. 

The unique word in the ground truth is "E760", and the OCR output has "1975", which is a different word. Since there are no matching words, even considering typos, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
