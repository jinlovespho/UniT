gt_text: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE
vlm_output: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE" and the VLM OCR output is the same: "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE". 

Step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Now for Step 2, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, like "ESCAPE NORWEGIAN", it would still be considered correct. But in this case, the order is the same.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "NORWEGIAN" and "ESCAPE". The OCR output has the same two words. So all unique words are present.

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spacing are also the same. There are no typos mentioned. The OCR output is exact. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. Even if there were small typos, like "NORWEGIAN ESCAP", it would still be category 1. But here, it's perfect. So the answer should be 1.
