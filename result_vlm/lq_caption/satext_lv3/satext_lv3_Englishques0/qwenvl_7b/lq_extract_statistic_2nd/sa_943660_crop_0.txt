Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PKP" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors.

The key points for comparison are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only the set of unique words in the ground truth are considered. The ground truth is "PKP", which is a single word. So the unique words here are just "PKP".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is letters.
- Small typos still count as matches, but I don't see any typos here since they are different types of characters.

Now, the categories:
1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth word is "PKP". The OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain "PKP" in any form. Even if we ignore case and spacing, "100%" doesn't have the letters P, K, or P. So there's no match here.

2 — Slightly correct: At least one but not all unique words match. But since the ground truth has only one unique word and the OCR output has none of it, this category doesn't apply either.

3 — Incorrect: No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since there's no match, this would be category 3.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible way "100%" could be considered a match. For example, if "100%" was a typo for "PKP", but "100%" is numbers and a symbol, while "PKP" is letters. The problem says small typos count as matches, but this isn't a typo—it's a completely different type of data. So no, there's no match. Therefore, the answer is category 3.

1. Correct Num: 166
2. Slightly Correct Num: 82
3. Incorrect Num: 447
