gt_text: FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth.

The ground truth has two unique words: "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. Let's check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "100%", there's no mention of "FANSIPAN" or "LEGEND". The OCR output is entirely numerical, so none of the words from the ground truth are present. 

The instructions say that if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Also, considering that typos are counted as matches, but here the OCR output is completely different in terms of words. 

So, the answer should be category 3 because none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output.
