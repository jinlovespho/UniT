gt_text: RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this with the ground truth text, which consists of several French words.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. However, small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth words: RUELLE, SAINTE, CARRUCETU, DEVOTE, DEVOTA, SANTA. All of these are distinct words. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not any of these words. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering possible typos or variations, there's no match. The output is unrelated to the ground truth text. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 3 — Incorrect.
