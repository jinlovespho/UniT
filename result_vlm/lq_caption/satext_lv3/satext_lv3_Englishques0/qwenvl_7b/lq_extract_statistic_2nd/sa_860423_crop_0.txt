gt_text: ИНФОРМАЦИЯ Amarok
vlm_output: 1998

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ Amarok" and the VLM OCR output is "1998". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1998", which is a number. Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which has two parts: "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ" (which is Russian for "information") and "Amarok" (a music player).

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ" and "Amarok". The OCR output is "1998", which is a number, not any of those words. 

Even if we consider typos or ignore case, "1998" doesn't resemble either of the ground truth words. Also, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. So, according to the categories, since no words match, it should be category 3. 

I need to make sure I didn't miss anything. The ground truth has two words, and the OCR output has none of them. The answer is definitely 3.
