gt_text: GRAND
vlm_output: GRAND

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "GRAND" and the VLM OCR output is also "GRAND". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "GRAND", so the extracted text is the same.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "GRAND". The OCR output also has "GRAND". 

We need to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, there are no typos because they're identical. 

Since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "GRAND"), according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and the only word is present. Even if there were typos, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. So the answer should be 1.
