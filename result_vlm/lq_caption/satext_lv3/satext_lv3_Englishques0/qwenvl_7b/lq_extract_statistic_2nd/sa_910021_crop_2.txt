gt_text: HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A". The VLM OCR output says "The image does not contain any visible English text."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that there's no visible English text. So the extracted text would be "The image does not contain any visible English text."

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "HEUNG" repeated three times and "A" once. But the OCR output is saying there's no text. 

The categories are based on whether the OCR output includes the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "HEUNG" and "A". The OCR output doesn't have any of those words. It's stating that there's no text, which is the opposite of the ground truth. So, the OCR output isn't matching any of the words. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is a statement about the absence of text, it doesn't contain the actual words from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
