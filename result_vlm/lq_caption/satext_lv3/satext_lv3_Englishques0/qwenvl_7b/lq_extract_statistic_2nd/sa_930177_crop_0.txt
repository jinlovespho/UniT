gt_text: MAIRIE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MAIRIE", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is "MAIRIE", which is a French word meaning "municipal council" or "town hall". 

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we only consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "MAIRIE". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, checking if there's any overlap. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number. The ground truth is a word. The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But "100%" is a number, not a word. The problem mentions comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "MAIRIE" or any variation of it (like typos), there's no match. 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output is entirely different. There's no word in the OCR output that could be considered a typo of "MAIRIE". The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since there are no matches, it's not category 2. Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. This fits category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 148
2. Slightly Correct Num: 72
3. Incorrect Num: 386
