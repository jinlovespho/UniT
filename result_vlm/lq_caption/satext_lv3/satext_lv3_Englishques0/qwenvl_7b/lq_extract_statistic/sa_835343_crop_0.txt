gt_text: il Presidente
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "il Presidente" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a numerical value with a percentage sign. The ground truth is "il Presidente", which translates to "the President" in English. 

Moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "il" and "Presidente". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, considering the rules: we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output here is entirely numerical and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "il" or "Presidente" in any way. The words in the ground truth are "il" (a definite article) and "Presidente" (a noun), which are not related to numbers or percentages. 

The categories are as follows: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 — Slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated.

Since "10%" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth ("il" or "Presidente"), there are no matches. Therefore, according to category 3, this should be considered incorrect. The OCR output is not related to the ground truth text at all. There's no overlap in words, and the content is entirely different. Even if we stretch the rules, there's no way "10%" can be considered a match for either "il" or "Presidente". So the answer should be category 3.
