gt_text: PINKO
vlm_output: PINKO

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PINKO" and the VLM OCR output is also "PINKO". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "PINKO", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PINKO". The OCR output also has "PINKO". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. So they match exactly in that regard.

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. However, in this case, there are no typos because both are the same. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "PINKO") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
