gt_text: Jobs
vlm_output: Jobs

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Jobs" and the VLM OCR output is also "Jobs". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Jobs", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Jobs".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "Jobs". Now, the comparison has some specific rules. Let me check them again.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words, so order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Jobs". The OCR output also has "Jobs". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (all caps), no punctuation, and no spaces. So that's not a problem here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly the same.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a match. Therefore, the category should be 1.

I don't see any issues here. Both are identical, so it's a correct match. No need to consider partial or incorrect categories. The answer is 1.
