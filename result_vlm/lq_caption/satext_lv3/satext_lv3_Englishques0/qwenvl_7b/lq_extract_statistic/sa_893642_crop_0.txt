----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "MICHAEL" and the OCR output is "SM ST MICHAELPENAMPANG". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The extracted text is "SM ST MICHAELPENAMPANG". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "MICHAEL".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MICHAEL".

Now, check if "MICHAEL" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "MICHAELPENAMPANG". Hmm, that's a typo. The OCR might have merged "MICHAEL" with "PENAMPANG" into one word. But the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So even though it's a typo, "MICHAELPENAMPANG" contains "MICHAEL" as a substring. But wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. Wait, but the OCR output's words are "SM", "ST", "MICHAELPENAMPANG". So the unique words in the OCR output are those three. The ground truth's unique word is "MICHAEL". So does "MICHAELPENAMPANG" count as a match for "MICHAEL"? The instruction says small typos still count as matches. So even though it's a typo, it's considered a match. Therefore, the OCR output contains "MICHAEL" as part of a longer word, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. Wait, maybe I need to split the OCR output into words. The OCR output is "SM ST MICHAELPENAMPANG" which are three words. The ground truth is "MICHAEL", which is one word. So the OCR output has "MICHAELPENAMPANG" as a single word. But the instruction says to ignore typos. So even though it's a typo, the presence of "MICHAEL" in the OCR output's word (as part of a longer word) would count as a match? Or does it need to be an exact word?

Wait, the instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has the word "MICHAEL". The OCR output's words are "SM", "ST", "MICHAELPENAMPANG". So the OCR output does not have the exact word "MICHAEL", but it has a typo. However, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So does that mean that "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is considered a match for "MICHAEL"? Or is the typo considered a mistake?

This is a bit confusing. If the OCR output has "MICHAELPENAMPANG", which is a typo where "MICHAEL" is merged with "PENAMPANG", then maybe the OCR is trying to capture "MICHAEL" but got it wrong. However, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So even if it's a typo, as long as the OCR output contains the correct word (even if it's part of a longer word), it counts? Or does it need to be an exact match?

Wait, the instruction says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth's unique words are "MICHAEL". The OCR output's words are "SM", "ST", "MICHAELPENAMPANG". So the OCR output does not have "MICHAEL" as a separate word. However, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So maybe "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is considered a match for "MICHAEL" because it's a typo. But how? If the OCR output's word is a longer version, does that count?

Alternatively, maybe the instruction means that even if there are typos in the OCR output's words, as long as the correct word is present (even with typos), it's considered a match. But in this case, the OCR output's word is "MICHAELPENAMPANG" which includes "MICHAEL" as a prefix. But the exact word isn't present. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces and typos. So maybe the presence of "MICHAEL" as a substring in the OCR output's word counts as a match?

Wait, the instructions are a bit ambiguous here. Let me re-read them.

Step 2 says: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering:

- Word order does NOT matter.

- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.

- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.

- Small typos still count as matches.

So the key is that the OCR output's words need to contain the ground truth's unique words, possibly with typos. So if the OCR output has a word that is a typo of the ground truth word, it counts as a match.

In this case, the ground truth has "MICHAEL". The OCR output has "MICHAELPENAMPANG". So the OCR output's word is a typo where "MICHAEL" is followed by "PENAMPANG". But is that considered a small typo? Or is it a larger error?

The instruction says "small typos still count as matches". So maybe if the OCR output's word contains the correct word as a substring, even if it's longer, it's considered a match. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's word is "MICHAEL" but with some letters added, which could be a typo. However, in this case, "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is a longer word, which might be considered a significant error, not a small typo.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "MICHAELPENAMPANG", which could be a case where the OCR incorrectly merged two words: "MICHAEL" and "PENAMPANG". So the OCR output is missing "PENAMPANG" but has "MICHAEL" as part of a longer word. However, the instruction says that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "MICHAEL" as the only unique word. The OCR output's words are "SM", "ST", and "MICHAELPENAMPANG". So the OCR output doesn't have "MICHAEL" as a separate word. But does it have a word that is a typo of "MICHAEL"?

If "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is considered a typo of "MICHAEL", then it would count as a match. However, the typo here is adding "PENAMPANG" to the end, which might be considered a larger error than a small typo. The instruction says "small typos still count as matches", but doesn't specify what constitutes a small typo. However, in this case, the OCR output's word contains "MICHAEL" as a prefix, which could be considered a partial match. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output doesn't have "MICHAEL" as a word, even if it's part of a longer word, does that count?

This is a bit unclear. However, given the instructions, perhaps the idea is that if the OCR output contains the correct word (even with typos), it counts. So "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is a typo of "MICHAEL", but since it's part of the OCR output, it's considered a match. Therefore, the OCR output contains the ground truth word (as a typo), so it's category 1.

But another interpretation is that the OCR output must have the exact word (or a small typo) as a separate word. In that case, since "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is not "MICHAEL", but a longer word, it's not a match, leading to category 3. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces and typos. So maybe the presence of "MICHAEL" in the OCR output's word, even if it's part of a longer word, counts as a match. 

Alternatively, maybe the instruction is that the OCR output's words should contain the ground truth words, possibly with typos. So if the OCR output has a word that is a typo of the ground truth word, it counts. So "MICHAELPENAMPANG" is a typo of "MICHAEL" (assuming that the OCR added "PENAMPANG" by mistake), then it counts as a match. Therefore, the answer would be 1.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the ground truth is "MICHAEL", and the OCR output has "MICHAELPENAMPANG". If we split the OCR output's word into possible parts, maybe it's supposed to be "MICHAEL" and "PENAMPANG" but merged. In that case, the OCR output contains "MICHAEL" as part of a longer word, which might be considered a match. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has "MICHAEL", and the OCR output's words include "MICHAELPENAMPANG", which is a typo, then it's considered a match. Therefore, category 1.
