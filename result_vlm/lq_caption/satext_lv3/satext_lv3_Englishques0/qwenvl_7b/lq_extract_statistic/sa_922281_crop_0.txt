gt_text: 700
vlm_output: TNT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "700" and the VLM OCR output is "TNT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "TNT". Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the number 700. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just one word: "700". The OCR output is "TNT", which is three letters. 

Now, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But "700" is a number, and "TNT" is letters. There's no overlap in characters here. The unique word in the ground truth is "700", and the OCR output has "TNT". Since they are entirely different, there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no overlap, it's category 3.
