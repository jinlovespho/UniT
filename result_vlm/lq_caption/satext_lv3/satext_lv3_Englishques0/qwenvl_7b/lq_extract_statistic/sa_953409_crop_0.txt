gt_text: HOTEL
vlm_output: HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "HOTEL" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOTEL". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "HOTEL", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are exactly the same word. 

Next, considering the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOTEL". The OCR output also has "HOTEL". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The other factors mentioned are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But in this case, both are the same in terms of case and spacing. Also, there are no typos here since they are identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since the OCR output matches exactly, even with the considerations given, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as 2 or 3. The output is completely correct as per the given criteria. So the answer should be 1.
