gt_text: LV
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LV" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "LV".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The next point is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "L" and "V". Wait, but "LV" is a single word, right? Or is it two separate letters? Hmm, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If "LV" is considered a single word, then the unique words are just "LV". But if it's two separate letters, then they are two unique words. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in OCR contexts, sometimes letters are treated as separate, but maybe here "LV" is a single entity like an abbreviation. 

But the OCR output is "100%", which is a different set. The unique words here would be "100%". Now, the comparison needs to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, considering case, spacing, typos, etc. 

But "LV" vs "100%". There's no overlap in the words. "LV" is letters, "100%" is numbers and a symbol. So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo, just a complete mismatch. So, since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words (assuming "LV" is a single word), the answer would be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe "LV" is two separate words? If the ground truth is "L" and "V" as two unique words, then the OCR output "100%" doesn't have either. Still, category 3. Alternatively, if the OCR output could have a typo that's similar to "LV", but "100%" doesn't resemble "LV" in any way. So regardless, no matches. Hence, category 3.
