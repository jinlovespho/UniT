gt_text: UNESCO
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UNESCO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "UNESCO".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, I should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. UNESCO is one word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But the OCR output here is "100%", which includes a percentage symbol. However, the ground truth is "UNESCO", which is a proper noun. 

The key point is whether "100%" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. Since UNESCO is a single word, and the OCR output is "100%", there's no overlap. Even if we ignore punctuation, "100%" doesn't contain the letters U, N, E, S, C, O. The numbers 1, 0, 0 don't match any letters in UNESCO. 

Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; it's a completely different set of characters. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
