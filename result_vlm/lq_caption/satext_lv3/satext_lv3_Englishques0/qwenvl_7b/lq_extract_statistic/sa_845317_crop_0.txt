gt_text: TEATRO
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TEATRO" and the VLM OCR output is "TEATRO SOLIS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "TEATRO SOLIS".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are just "TEATRO" (since it's one word). The OCR output has two words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS".

Now, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "TEATRO". The OCR output includes "TEATRO" as the first word, so that's a match. The second word "SOLIS" isn't in the ground truth, but since we're only checking if all unique ground truth words are present, and "TEATRO" is there, that's all that's needed. 

The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are uppercase, so no issue. The OCR output has an extra word, but since the ground truth only has "TEATRO", and that's present, the category would be 1 — Correct. Even though there's an extra word, the presence of the required word is sufficient. 

I don't think the extra word affects the category here because the criteria are about the unique words from the ground truth being present. So category 1 applies.
