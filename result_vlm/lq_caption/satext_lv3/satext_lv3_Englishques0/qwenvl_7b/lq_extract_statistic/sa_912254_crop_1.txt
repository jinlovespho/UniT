gt_text: CHASE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHASE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "CHASE".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the ground truth is a single word: "CHASE". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "CHASE". The OCR output doesn't have any words that match "CHASE". Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "CHASE" in any way. There's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output has no words that match "CHASE", it falls into category 3. The output is unrelated (a percentage vs. a word) and there are no matches. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 154
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 340
