gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, just "NANTES". So the order isn't an issue here.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has the same word. So the unique words match perfectly.

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's not a factor here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case since both are identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a match. So the answer should be 1.

I don't see any other factors that would make this a partial or incorrect match. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, category 1 is correct.
