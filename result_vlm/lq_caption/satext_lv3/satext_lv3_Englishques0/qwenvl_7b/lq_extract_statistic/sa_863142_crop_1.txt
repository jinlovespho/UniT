Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "214" and the VLM OCR output is also "214". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "214", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are exactly "214".

Next, the comparison needs to consider unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the number "214", which is a single word (assuming numbers are treated as words here). The OCR output also has "214", so the unique words match exactly. The note says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Since there's no capitalization or punctuation here, and the spacing is the same (just the number), that's not an issue. Also, small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just "214") are present. Therefore, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
