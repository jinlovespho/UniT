Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AVEMARIA" and the OCR output is "1870". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1870". Now, the ground truth is "AVEMARIA", which is a word, probably a name or a term. The OCR output is a number, "1870".

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is "AVEMARIA" which is a single word. The OCR output is "1870", which is a number. The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has one unique word: "AVEMARIA". The OCR output has "1870", which is a number, not a word. 

But the problem says to consider small typos as matches. However, "1870" is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a word. So, there's no overlap in terms of words. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "1870" doesn't resemble "AVEMARIA" in any way. 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any words. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
