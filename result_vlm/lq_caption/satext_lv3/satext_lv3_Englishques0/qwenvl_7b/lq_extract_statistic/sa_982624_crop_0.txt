gt_text: THIRD
vlm_output: FIFTH THIRD

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "THIRD" and the VLM OCR output is "FIFTH THIRD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "FIFTH THIRD". So the words are "FIFTH" and "THIRD".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth, which is "THIRD". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if all the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "THIRD". 

Looking at the OCR output, "THIRD" is present. Even though there's an extra word "FIFTH", the presence of "THIRD" is enough. Also, the comparison is case-insensitive, but both are uppercase here. There are no typos in "THIRD" in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "THIRD") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
