Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIS" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "NIS", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NIS".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "NIS", which is three letters. The OCR output is the same. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "NIS" (assuming it's a single word here). Since the OCR output is exactly the same, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. 

So according to the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since the OCR output has "NIS" which is exactly the same as the ground truth, all words match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
