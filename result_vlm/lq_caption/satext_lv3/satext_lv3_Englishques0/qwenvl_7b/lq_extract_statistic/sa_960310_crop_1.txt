Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "next" and the VLM OCR output is also "next". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "next", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "next".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "next". Now, the comparison has some specific rules. Let me check them again.

The comparison should consider word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "next". The OCR output also has "next". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique ground truth words are present. There's no missing words, and the output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be category 1.
