gt_text: Medical
vlm_output: Medical Centre

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Medical" and the VLM OCR output is "Medical Centre". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Medical Centre". So the extracted text is just that exact string, but I need to process it according to the given criteria.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Medical". The OCR output has "Medical" and "Centre". 

The instructions say to consider word order as not important. So I don't have to worry about the sequence of words. Then, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Medical". The OCR output has two words: "Medical" and "Centre".

Now, the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, "Medical" is exactly present in the OCR output. The other word "Centre" isn't part of the ground truth. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are {"Medical"}. The OCR output's unique words are {"Medical", "Centre"}. The intersection here is {"Medical"}, which is all of the ground truth words. Therefore, according to category 1, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (even though there's an extra word), it should be category 1. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "Medical", and the OCR output has "Medical", that's a match. The presence of "Centre" is extra but doesn't affect the match for the ground truth words. 

So the answer should be category 1.
