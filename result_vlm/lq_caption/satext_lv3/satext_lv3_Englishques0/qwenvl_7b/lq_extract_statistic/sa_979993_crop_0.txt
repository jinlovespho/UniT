gt_text: VERSACE
vlm_output: VERSACE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VERSACE" and the VLM OCR output is also "VERSACE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "VERSACE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "VERSACE". The OCR output also has "VERSACE".

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because they are exactly the same.

Since all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "VERSACE") are present in the OCR output, that should fall under category 1. The categories say category 1 is correct when all unique words match. There's only one word here, so it's a perfect match. No issues here. So the answer should be 1.
