gt_text: Adlisberg
vlm_output: Kleinesdorf

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "Adlisberg" and the OCR output is "Kleinesdorf". I need to compare these based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output, which is "Kleinesdorf". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Adlisberg". The OCR output has "Kleinesdorf". 

Now, checking if they are the same word. Ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized here. However, the words themselves are different. Adlisberg vs Kleinesdorf. Are these similar enough? The problem says small typos still count as matches, but these aren't typos; they're completely different words. So there's no overlap in the unique words. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output has a different word entirely. So the answer should be 3.
