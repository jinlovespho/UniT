gt_text: BOTTEGA
vlm_output: BOTTEGA VENETA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BOTTEGA" and the VLM OCR output is "BOTTEGA VENETA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output is "BOTTEGA VENETA". Then, I compare this with the ground truth. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "BOTTEGA". The OCR output has two words: "BOTTEGA" and "VENETA". 

Now, according to the instructions, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "BOTTEGA" as the only unique word. The OCR output includes "BOTTEGA" exactly as in the ground truth, ignoring case, spacing, etc. Even though there's an extra word "VENETA" in the OCR output, that doesn't matter because the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. 

Since "BOTTEGA" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an additional word, the category should be 1 — Correct. The presence of an extra word doesn't affect the match because the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output includes the necessary word, so it's a correct match.
