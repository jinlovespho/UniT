gt_text: NESSELBECK

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "NESSELBECK" and the VLM OCR output is "1980". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1980", which is just numbers. The ground truth is a name, "NESSELBECK", which is all uppercase letters.

Now step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NESSELBECK". The OCR output has "1980", which is a number, not a word. 

The criteria say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the OCR output is entirely numbers, while the ground truth is letters. There's no overlap in characters here. Also, small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo because the OCR output is completely different in terms of character type.

So, looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But "NESSELBECK" isn't in "1980". Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there's no match here. So it would fall into category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1980" is a year and the ground truth is a name, they are unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
