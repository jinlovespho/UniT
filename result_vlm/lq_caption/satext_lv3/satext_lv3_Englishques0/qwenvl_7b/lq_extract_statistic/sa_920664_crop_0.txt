gt_text: DREAMCATCHERS
vlm_output: DREAMCATCHERS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DREAMCATCHERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "DREAMCATCHERS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "DREAMCATCHERS".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. 

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "DREAMCATCHERS". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation. There are no typos here since they are identical. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even if there were typos, the category would still be 1. Here, there are no typos, so it's a perfect match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
