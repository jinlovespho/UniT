gt_text: 2017
vlm_output: Santo Domingo

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "2017", and the VLM OCR output is "Santo Domingo". I need to follow the steps given to determine the category.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Santo Domingo", so that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "2017", which is a year. 

The comparison criteria mention that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth is just the number 2017. The OCR output has two words: Santo and Domingo. The unique words in the ground truth are just "2017". Wait, but "2017" is a number, not a word. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, "2017" isn't a word—it's a numeral. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

But according to the problem, the ground truth is "2017", which is a single entity. The OCR output is "Santo Domingo", which are two proper nouns. The comparison is supposed to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "2017", which isn't a word, but the OCR output has "Santo" and "Domingo", which are not related to "2017". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "2017", but the OCR output doesn't have that word. Therefore, there are no matches. The categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated. So the answer should be 3. But wait, maybe the ground truth is considered as a single word "2017", and the OCR output has no words matching it. So no matches, hence category 3.
