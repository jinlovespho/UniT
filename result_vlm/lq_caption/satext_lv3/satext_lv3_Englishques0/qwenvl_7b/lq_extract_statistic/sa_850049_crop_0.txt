gt_text: Lime
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Lime" and the VLM OCR output is "100". So, I need to compare these two according to the steps given.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. Then step 2 says to compare with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Lime".

Next, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output here is "100", which is numbers, not letters. Also, small typos count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo because "100" isn't even a typo of "Lime"; it's completely different characters.

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "Lime". The OCR output has "100", which doesn't have any letters. Therefore, there's no match. The category would be 3 because there are no words matching. Even if we consider typos, "100" isn't a typo of "Lime". It's just numbers. So the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 47
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 89
