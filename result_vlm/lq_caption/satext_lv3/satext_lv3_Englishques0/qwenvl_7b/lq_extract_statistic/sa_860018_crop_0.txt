gt_text: HOUSE
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "HOUSE", which is a word. 

Now step 2 is to compare them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HOUSE". The OCR output is "100", which is numbers, not letters. So there are no words in the OCR output that match "HOUSE" when considering letters. 

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces, but since the OCR output is numbers, there's no letters to match. Also, small typos still count as matches, but here there's no letters at all. 

So the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique word. Therefore, according to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong. Since "100" doesn't contain any letters from "HOUSE", it's category 3.
