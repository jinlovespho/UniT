gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: Duty

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Duty" and the VLM OCR output is also "Duty". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Duty".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Duty". The OCR output also has "Duty". So the set of unique words in the OCR output matches exactly with the ground truth's set.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (both start with uppercase D) and there's no punctuation or spaces to consider here. The OCR output has exactly one word with no extra spaces.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both have the same single word, this is a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
