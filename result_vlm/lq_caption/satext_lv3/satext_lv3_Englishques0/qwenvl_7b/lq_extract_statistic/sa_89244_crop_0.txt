gt_text: BRISAS
vlm_output: 2017-2018

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BRISAS" and the VLM OCR output is "2017-2018". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2017-2018", which is straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "BRISAS". Let's break that down. The OCR output is "2017-2018", which is a date range. The unique words in the ground truth are just "BRISAS" (assuming it's one word). Now, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "BRISAS" isn't present in "2017-2018". There's no overlap in words here. 

Even if I consider possible typos, "BRISAS" is a proper noun, possibly a name or a place. The OCR output has numbers and a hyphen. There's no way "2017-2018" can be a typo for "BRISAS" because they are entirely different types of data. The OCR output is a date, while the ground truth is a word. 

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The criteria mention that if no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty, it's category 3. Here, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
