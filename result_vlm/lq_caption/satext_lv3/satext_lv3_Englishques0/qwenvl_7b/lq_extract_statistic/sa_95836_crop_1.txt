Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "ROVER" and a VLM OCR output also "ROVER". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "ROVER", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "ROVER", which is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Let's break down the comparison:

- Both texts are "ROVER", so they are identical. Since the OCR output matches exactly, even if there were typos, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos.
- The unique words in the ground truth are just "ROVER". The OCR output also has "ROVER", so all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
- Word order isn't an issue here because there's only one word.
- Capitalization is the same (all caps), but even if it were different, we're supposed to ignore that. However, in this case, it's the same.
- No punctuation or spaces to consider since it's a single word with no spaces or punctuation.

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output. Since "ROVER" is the only unique word and it's present, this meets category 1.
- Categories 2 and 3 don't apply here because there's a full match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
