gt_text: BEACO
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEACO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the steps provided.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Now step 2 is to compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth is "BEACO". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore that. But we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "BEACO". So the unique words here are just "BEACO".

The OCR output is "100%". Let's check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100%", which is numbers and a percentage sign. The ground truth word is "BEACO", which is letters. There's no overlap in characters here. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But even if we consider that, "100%" doesn't have any letters that match "BEACO". The OCR output is entirely numbers and a symbol. So there's no match at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there's no overlap between the OCR output and the ground truth words, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even small typos would count, but in this case, there's no letters matching. So definitely category 3.
