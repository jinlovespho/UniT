Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1057" and the VLM OCR output is also "1057". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "1057", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the OCR output.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are exactly the same. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "1057" since it's a single number. The OCR output also has "1057". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation, and the spacing is the same. Also, there are no typos here because the OCR output matches exactly. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since all the unique words (just one word here) are present, the category should be 1. 

I think that's it. No issues here. The answer is category 1.
