gt_text: mossos
vlm_output: mossos d'esquadra

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "mossos" and the VLM OCR output is "mossos d'esquadra". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's "mossos d'esquadra".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has the word "mossos" and the OCR output also has "mossos". Then there's "d'esquadra" in the OCR output. But the ground truth only has "mossos". Wait, the unique words in the ground truth are just "mossos", right? Because it's only one word. The OCR output has two words: "mossos" and "d'esquadra".

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "mossos", we check if that word is present in the OCR output. It is. The other word in OCR, "d'esquadra", isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking the ground truth's words. So all unique ground truth words (just "mossos") are present in the OCR output. 

Also, considering the rules: ignore case, punctuation, spaces. The OCR has "d'esquadra" which includes an apostrophe and a space, but since the ground truth doesn't have those, but we're only checking for the presence of the words. The OCR has "mossos" exactly as in the ground truth. So even though there's an extra word, the required word is there. 

So according to category 1: all unique ground truth words appear. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
