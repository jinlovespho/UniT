gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "POLIZEI", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word. The ground truth has one unique word, "POLIZEI", and the OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or any issues. Even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches, but here there are none. So the answer should be 1.
