gt_text: 2,2
vlm_output: No Parking

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2,2" and the VLM OCR output is "No Parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "No Parking".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the text "2,2". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me parse that. The ground truth is "2,2"—so splitting by spaces, but there's only one word here, which is "2,2". Wait, but maybe the ground truth is considered as two numbers separated by a comma? However, the problem says to consider the set of unique words. So "2,2" is one word, right? Because there's no space. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"2,2"}.

Now, the OCR output is "No Parking". The unique words here are {"No", "Parking"}. 

Comparing the two sets: the ground truth has {"2,2"} and the OCR output has {"No", "Parking"}. There are no overlapping words. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3—Incorrect. 

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the ground truth. Could "2,2" be split into two words? Like "2" and "2"? But the original text is written as "2,2", which is a single number with a comma. The problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "2,2", then it's one word. So the OCR output has "No Parking", which are two different words. Therefore, there's no match. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—it's entirely different words. So the answer should be category 3.
