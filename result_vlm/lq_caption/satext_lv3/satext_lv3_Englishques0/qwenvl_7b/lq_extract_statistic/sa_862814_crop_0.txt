gt_text: HANC
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HANC" and the VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The output here is a statement that there's no visible English text. So the extracted text would be that exact sentence.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HANC", which is a four-letter word. The OCR output is saying there's no text, so it's not mentioning "HANC" at all. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output. But the OCR output doesn't have "HANC" or any part of it. The ground truth is just one word, "HANC", and the OCR output doesn't mention it. 

Category 2 is for partial matches. But since the OCR output says there's no text, it's not even attempting to mention the word. So there's no partial match here. 

Category 3 is for when there's no match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is stating that there's no text, which is the opposite of the ground truth, it's not matching at all. Also, the output is unrelated to the actual content (assuming the image does have "HANC" as per the ground truth). 

So the correct category here would be 3 because there's no match and the output is unrelated.
