Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "251" and the VLM OCR output is also "251". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "251", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are just three digits. Since there's only one "word" here (assuming numbers are treated as words), the order isn't an issue because there's only one word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the number "251", which is a single unique word. The OCR output also has "251", so the unique words match exactly. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since both are just numbers without any letters or punctuation, this doesn't affect the comparison. Also, there are no typos here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. 

I don't see any reason to categorize it as 2 or 3. The output is exactly correct, so it's definitely category 1.
