gt_text: UNO
vlm_output: UNO

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNO" and the VLM OCR output is also "UNO". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "UNO", that's straightforward. Then step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are exactly the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "UNO". The OCR output has the same word. So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos, this should fall into category 1. The categories say that 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here and it's a match, even with the same case and spacing, it's definitely category 1. There's no typo here, but even if there were a small typo, the note says they still count as matches. So regardless, this is a perfect match. No chance of it being category 2 or 3. So the answer should be 1.
