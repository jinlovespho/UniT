gt_text: Schweppes
vlm_output: Schweppes

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Schweppes" and the VLM OCR output is also "Schweppes". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Schweppes", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both texts are the same word.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Schweppes". The OCR output also has the same word. 

We need to ignore capitalization, but both are capitalized the same way here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider since both are just the word "Schweppes". Also, there are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
