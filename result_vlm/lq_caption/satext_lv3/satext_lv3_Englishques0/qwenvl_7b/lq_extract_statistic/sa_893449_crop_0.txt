gt_text: POSTAGE
vlm_output: POSTAGE

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "POSTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POSTAGE". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we have to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "POSTAGE". The OCR output also has "POSTAGE". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. Punctuation and spaces—there's no punctuation or extra spaces here. Typos are mentioned to still count as matches if they're small. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "POSTAGE") are present in the OCR output, that would fall under category 1. The answer should be 1.
