Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Tropical" and the VLM OCR output is also "Tropical". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Tropical".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Tropical". The OCR output is the same word. So when comparing, since the words are identical (case doesn't matter, but here they are both capitalized the same), and there are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, all unique words (just one) are present. So that should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The output matches exactly, so the answer is 1.
