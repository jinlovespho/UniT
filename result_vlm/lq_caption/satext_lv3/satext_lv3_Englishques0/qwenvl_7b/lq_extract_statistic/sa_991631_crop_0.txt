gt_text: Scoopy
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Scoopy" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "100%".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Scoopy". Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Scoopy". 

Next, we have to check if the OCR output contains any of these words, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. The word "Scoopy" doesn't seem related to "100%". There's no overlap in words here. "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, while "Scoopy" is a name. 

So, according to the categories: category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, there's one unique word, and it's not present in the OCR output. So category 1 doesn't apply. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it's not category 2. Then category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain "Scoopy" and they are unrelated, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions say to consider small typos as matches. However, "100%" isn't even close to "Scoopy" in terms of letters. There's no typo here, just a completely different word. So no match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
