gt_text: POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLITIE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLITIE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "POLITIE".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POLITIE". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
