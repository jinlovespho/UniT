gt_text: OXYGEN
vlm_output: OXYGEN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OXYGEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "OXYGEN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OXYGEN".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OXYGEN". The OCR output also has "OXYGEN". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. The answer should be 1.
