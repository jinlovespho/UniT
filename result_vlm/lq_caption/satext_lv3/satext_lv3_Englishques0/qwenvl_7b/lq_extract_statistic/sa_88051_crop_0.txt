gt_text: AIRBUS
vlm_output: AEROMEXICO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "AIRBUS" and the VLM OCR output is "AEROMEXICO". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "AEROMEXICO". 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "AIRBUS", which is a single word. The OCR output is "AEROMEXICO", which is another single word.

Now, I need to check if there's any match. The unique words in the ground truth are just "AIRBUS". The OCR output has "AEROMEXICO". Are these considered a match? Let's see. The problem says to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Also, check for typos. "AEROMEXICO" vs "AIRBUS" – they are different words. There's no overlap in letters that would suggest a typo. For example, "AEROMEXICO" is a real airline, but "AIRBUS" is a manufacturer. They are distinct. 

Since the ground truth has only one word, and the OCR output has a different word, there are no matching unique words. So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions say "small typos still count as matches." However, in this case, there's no typo leading to a match. The OCR output is a completely different word. Therefore, no matches. So the answer should be category 3.
