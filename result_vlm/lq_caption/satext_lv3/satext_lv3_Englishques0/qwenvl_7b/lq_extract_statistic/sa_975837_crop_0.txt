gt_text: Buvette
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Buvette" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "Buvette". 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But "Buvette" is a single word, and the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain any of the letters from "Buvette" except maybe 'e' and 't', but not in the right order or context. 

Category 2 is for partial matches, but since the OCR output has no words that match "Buvette" even partially (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), there's no overlap. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is completely unrelated to "Buvette" and there's no matching words, this would fall under category 3.
