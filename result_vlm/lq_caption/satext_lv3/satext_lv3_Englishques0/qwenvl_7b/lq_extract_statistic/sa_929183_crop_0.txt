gt_text: EQUINOX
vlm_output: 10% OFF

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EQUINOX" and the VLM OCR output is "10% OFF". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10% OFF". Now, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is "EQUINOX". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EQUINOX". 

Now, I need to check if this word appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "10%", "OFF". Neither of these are related to "EQUINOX". There's no mention of "equinox" or any variation of it. The OCR output is about a discount, while the ground truth is a word related to a celestial event. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But even if I ignore those, "10% OFF" doesn't contain "equinox" in any form. There's no overlap in words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there are no matching words, the category should be 3.
