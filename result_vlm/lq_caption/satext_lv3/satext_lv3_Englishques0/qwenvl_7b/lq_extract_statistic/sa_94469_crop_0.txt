gt_text: KVADRO
vlm_output: PARKING

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KVADRO" and the VLM OCR output is "PARKING". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PARKING", which is a single word. The ground truth is "KVADRO", also a single word. 

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "KVADRO". The OCR output has one unique word: "PARKING".

Now, considering the rules about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both words are in uppercase, but even if they were different cases, we'd ignore that. However, the actual letters are different. "KVADRO" vs. "PARKING" – they don't share any common letters. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the words are completely different. There's no overlap in letters. For example, if the OCR had "KAVDRO" (a typo), that would be considered a match. But "PARKING" is entirely different.

Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has a different word, there are no matches. Therefore, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." 

So the answer should be category 3.
