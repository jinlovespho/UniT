gt_text: N700NJ
vlm_output: N700MJ

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "N700NJ" and the VLM OCR output is "N700MJ". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here. Both are just the strings "N700NJ" and "N700MJ". 

Next, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since these are single strings, maybe we need to consider them as individual words. Wait, the ground truth has one word, "N700NJ", and the OCR output has "N700MJ". 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "N700NJ". The OCR output's unique word is "N700MJ". Now, comparing them. The instruction says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, both are all caps, no punctuation, and no spaces. So the only difference is the last character: 'J' vs 'M'.

The question is whether this counts as a typo. The note says small typos still count as matches. So even though the OCR output has a typo (M instead of J), it's considered a match. Therefore, the unique word from the ground truth is present in the OCR output with a small typo. So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this would be correct. 

So the answer should be category 1.
