gt_text: Only
vlm_output: Only

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "Only" and the VLM OCR output is also "Only". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Only".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Only". The OCR output also has "Only". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "Only", there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, this fits Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
