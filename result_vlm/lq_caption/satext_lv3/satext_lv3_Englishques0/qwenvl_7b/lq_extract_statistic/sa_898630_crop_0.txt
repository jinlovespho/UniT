gt_text: IKEA
vlm_output: IKEA

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "IKEA" and the VLM OCR output is also "IKEA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "IKEA", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "IKEA".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "IKEA". Now, the comparison has some specific rules. Let me check them again.

The rules say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, there's only one word, so order isn't an issue. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "IKEA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. So that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "IKEA") are present in the OCR output, that should be category 1. The answer should be 1. 

Wait, are there any other possible issues? The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So no issues here. The categories are 1 for correct, 2 for partially correct, 3 for incorrect. Since all words match, it's category 1.
