gt_text: LEEDS
vlm_output: LIBRARY GALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "LEEDS" and the OCR output is "LIBRARY GALLERY". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done here. Then, compare the extracted text with the ground truth based on the given criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the set of unique words in both. The ground truth has one word: "LEEDS". The OCR output has two words: "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY". 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth. The ground truth word is "LEEDS". The OCR words are "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY". None of these are the same as "LEEDS". 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "LEEDS" vs "LIBRARY" or "GALLERY" aren't typos of each other. They are completely different words. So there's no match here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the ground truth has one word and none of the OCR output's words match, it falls into category 3. 

I think that's it. The answer should be 3.
