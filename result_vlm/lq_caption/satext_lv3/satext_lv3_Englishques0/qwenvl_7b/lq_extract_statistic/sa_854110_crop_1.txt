Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ALEXELA" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALEXELA". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "ALEXELA", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But wait, both texts are single words here. So the order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ALEXELA". The OCR output is the same word. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are all caps and no spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here because they are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output", this should be category 1. There's no missing words, and the only word is present. Even if there were typos, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. So the answer is 1.
