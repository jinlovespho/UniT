Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "13" and the VLM OCR output is also "13". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "13".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth is "13". Let's break that down. The unique words here are "13". The OCR output is exactly "13". Since they are the same, there's no issue with order, case, or spacing. Also, there are no typos here because they are identical.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "13", and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So this should be category 1.

I don't see any other factors here. The output isn't empty, there are no typos, and all words match. So the answer should be 1.
