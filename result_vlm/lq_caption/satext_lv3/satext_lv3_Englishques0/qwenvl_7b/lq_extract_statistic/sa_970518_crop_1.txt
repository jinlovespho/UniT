gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
