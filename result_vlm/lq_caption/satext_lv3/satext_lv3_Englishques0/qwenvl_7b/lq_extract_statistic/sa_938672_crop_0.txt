gt_text: MOD
vlm_output: MOD PIZZA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MOD" and the VLM OCR output is "MOD PIZZA". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "MOD PIZZA". Then compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MOD". The OCR output has "MOD" and "PIZZA". 

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "MOD" as a unique word. The OCR output has "MOD" and "PIZZA". 

Now, check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "MOD" is in the OCR output, that's a match. The other word in OCR, "PIZZA", isn't in the ground truth, but the rules say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has all the required words (just "MOD") and maybe more. 

Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Here, both are uppercase, so no issue. No typos mentioned. So the OCR output includes the ground truth word. Therefore, category 1: correct.
