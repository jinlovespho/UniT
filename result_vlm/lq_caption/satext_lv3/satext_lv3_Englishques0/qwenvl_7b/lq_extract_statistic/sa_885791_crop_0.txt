gt_text: 2

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "2", and the OCR output has "100%". 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. We should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "2". 

Now, the OCR output has "100%", which is a single word. The task is to see if this word matches the ground truth's unique words. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100%" has a percentage symbol, which is punctuation. But the ground truth is just "2". 

The instruction says that small typos still count as matches. However, "100%" isn't a typo of "2". It's a different number entirely. The OCR output is not matching the ground truth's word. 

So, since the OCR output's word "100%" isn't matching the ground truth's "2", even after considering the rules, there are no matches. Therefore, the category should be 3 — Incorrect, because no words match.
