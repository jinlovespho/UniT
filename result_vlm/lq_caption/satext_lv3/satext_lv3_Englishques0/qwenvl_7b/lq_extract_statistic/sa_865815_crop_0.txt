gt_text: REBOQUE
vlm_output: NO DELIVERY ATSUNDAY 10:00-14:00

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "REBOQUE" and the VLM OCR output is "NO DELIVERY ATSUNDAY 10:00-14:00". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "NO DELIVERY ATSUNDAY 10:00-14:00". So the words here are "NO", "DELIVERY", "ATSUNDAY", "10:00-14:00". 

Next, I need to compare this with the ground truth, which is "REBOQUE". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "REBOQUE".

Now, I have to check if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth word. The OCR output has words like "NO", "DELIVERY", "ATSUNDAY", and a time. None of these seem to be related to "REBOQUE". 

But wait, maybe there's a typo? The OCR might have misread "REBOQUE" as something else. Let me check. "ATSUNDAY" might be a typo for "SUNDAY", but even if that's the case, "SUNDAY" isn't "REBOQUE". The other words like "DELIVERY" and "NO" are unrelated. The time format "10:00-14:00" is also not related. 

The instructions say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no word in the OCR output that could be a typo for "REBOQUE". "REBOQUE" is a Spanish word meaning "tow" or "tractor", and the OCR output doesn't have any words that resemble that. 

Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
