gt_text: Hybrid

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Hybrid" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just the number 100 with a percent sign.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has the word "Hybrid". Let's break it down. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Hybrid". 

Now, checking if "100%" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. "Hybrid" isn't present here. The OCR output has "100" and "%", which are numbers and a symbol, not the word "Hybrid". 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Hybrid" isn't in the OCR output, that's not met. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches here. So, it's Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be 3.
