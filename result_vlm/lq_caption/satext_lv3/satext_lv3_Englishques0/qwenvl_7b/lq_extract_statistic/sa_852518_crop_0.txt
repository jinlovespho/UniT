gt_text: TECHNOGYM
vlm_output: Theatre

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "TECHNOGYM" and the OCR output is "Theatre". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR, which is "Theatre". Then compare it with the ground truth.

Step 2 says to consider word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one word, "TECHNOGYM", and the OCR output has "Theatre". Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has only "TECHNOGYM", but the OCR has "Theatre". 

Looking at the rules: ignore capitalization, so "Theatre" vs "TECHNOGYM" would be compared as lowercase. But "theatre" and "technogym" are different words. There's no overlap in the unique words. The OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. Also, typos are considered, but even if there were a typo, "Theatre" isn't close to "Technogym" in terms of letters. So no matches. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
