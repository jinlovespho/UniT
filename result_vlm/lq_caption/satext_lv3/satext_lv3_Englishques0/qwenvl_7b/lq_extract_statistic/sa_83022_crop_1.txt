gt_text: PLAZA
vlm_output: PLAZA MAYOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLAZA" and the VLM OCR output is "PLAZA MAYOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PLAZA MAYOR", which consists of two words: "PLAZA" and "MAYOR".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PLAZA". The OCR output includes "PLAZA" exactly as in the ground truth, ignoring case and spacing. Even though there's an extra word "MAYOR" in the OCR output, the problem states that we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "PLAZA" is present in the OCR output, and the other conditions (like ignoring order, case, spacing, and small typos) are met, this should count as a correct match. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. 
Here, the ground truth has only "PLAZA", which is present. The extra word "MAYOR" doesn't affect this since the comparison is based on the ground truth's unique words. 

So, the answer should be category 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 9
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 10
