gt_text: GEDOENG
vlm_output: PARK HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "GEDOENG" and the OCR output is "PARK HOTEL". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "PARK HOTEL". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has one word: GEDOENG. The OCR output has two words: PARK and HOTEL. Now, according to the steps, I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "GEDOENG" as a unique word. The OCR output has "PARK" and "HOTEL". 

But the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word. The OCR output doesn't have that word. So none of the words match. 

Wait, but the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. Here, the ground truth has one word, which isn't in the OCR output. So that would be category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match. The OCR output has different words entirely. 

Even if I consider typos, but the OCR output words are PARK and HOTEL, which are not related to GEDOENG. So no match. So category 3.
