gt_text: CONTINENTAL
vlm_output: There is no visible text in the image provided.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CONTINENTAL", and the VLM OCR output is "There is no visible text in the image provided." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence stating that there's no visible text. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CONTINENTAL". 

Now, I need to check if "CONTINENTAL" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output says "There is no visible text in the image provided." Looking at the words here: "There", "is", "no", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "provided." None of these words are "CONTINENTAL" or any variation of it. Even if we consider case insensitivity, "continental" isn't present. Also, there are no typos that could lead to "continental" here. The OCR output is stating that there's no text, which is the opposite of the ground truth.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "CONTINENTAL" and instead says there's no text, it's not matching any of the ground truth words. Therefore, the category should be 3.
