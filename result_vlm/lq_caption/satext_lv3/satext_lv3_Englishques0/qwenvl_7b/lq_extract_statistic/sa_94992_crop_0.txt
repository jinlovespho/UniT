gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: Airbus

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is "Airbus". I need to compare these based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "Airbus". Then compare it with the ground truth, which is "QATAR". 

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "QATAR". The OCR output has "Airbus", which is a different word. Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "QATAR" and "Airbus" are completely different words. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

Also, small typos would count as matches, but in this case, it's not a typo. It's a completely different word. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 213
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 508
