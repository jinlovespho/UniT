gt_text: NORWEGIAN
vlm_output: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NORWEGIAN" and the VLM OCR output is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the output is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has the word "NORWEGIAN". The OCR output has "NORWEGIAN" as the first word and "ESCAPE" as the second. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "NORWEGIAN" (since it's a single word). The OCR output has two words, but "NORWEGIAN" is present. The other word, "ESCAPE", isn't in the ground truth. However, the instructions mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, we check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.

Since "NORWEGIAN" is in the OCR output, and there are no other words in the ground truth, this would mean all unique ground truth words are present. Even though there's an extra word ("ESCAPE") in the OCR output, the rules say to ignore extra words. Also, capitalization and spacing are ignored, but in this case, the OCR output's "NORWEGIAN" matches exactly in terms of letters and case (though the problem says to ignore capitalization, but here both are uppercase, so no issue). There are no typos mentioned here, so "NORWEGIAN" is a perfect match.

Therefore, according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
