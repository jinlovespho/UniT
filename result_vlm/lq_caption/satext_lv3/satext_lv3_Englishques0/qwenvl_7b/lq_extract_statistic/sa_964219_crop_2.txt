gt_text: HEAD
vlm_output: HEAD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "HEAD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HEAD". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HEAD", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word "HEAD".

Now, considering the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HEAD". The OCR output also has "HEAD". 

The comparison needs to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. Also, there are no typos since they're identical.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
