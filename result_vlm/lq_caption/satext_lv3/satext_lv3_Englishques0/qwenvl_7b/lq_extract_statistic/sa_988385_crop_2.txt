gt_text: Hobie
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Hobie" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percent sign. Then step 2 is to compare with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Hobie".

Now, the rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output here is "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. The ground truth is a name, "Hobie". So, the OCR output doesn't have any words that match "Hobie". Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "Hobie". They are completely different. So, there are no matches here.

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one, "Hobie", and it's not in the OCR output, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches here. So, category 3 is incorrect: no words match, or the output is unrelated. "100%" is unrelated to "Hobie", so category 3 applies.
