gt_text: PONANT
vlm_output: PONANT

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "PONANT" and the VLM OCR output is also "PONANT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "PONANT".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "PONANT" (since it's a single word). The OCR output also has "PONANT". 

Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are uppercase and no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

Since all unique ground truth words (just one) are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the single word matches exactly.
