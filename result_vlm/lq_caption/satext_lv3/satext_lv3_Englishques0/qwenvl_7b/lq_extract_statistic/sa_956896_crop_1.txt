Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "226" and the VLM OCR output is "100". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, both are numbers here. The ground truth is "226" and the OCR output is "100". 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "226" since it's a single number. The OCR output has "100" as a single number. Now, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. So, the ground truth has {"226"} and the OCR output has {"100"}. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "226" isn't in "100", so that's not a match. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, then there are zero matches. 

Category 3 is for no words matching or the output is unrelated. Since "100" doesn't contain "226", and there's no overlap, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the problem says to consider small typos as matches. However, "226" and "100" are different numbers. There's no typo here; they are entirely different. So no match. Therefore, the answer is 3.
