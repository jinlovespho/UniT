gt_text: W
vlm_output: W

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "W" and the VLM OCR output is also "W". So, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's just "W".

Now step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "W". The OCR output has "W" as well. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but since both are uppercase, that's not an issue here. Punctuation and spaces are also to be ignored, but there's no punctuation or spaces in either. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there's no typo here because they're exactly the same.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. I think the answer is 1.
