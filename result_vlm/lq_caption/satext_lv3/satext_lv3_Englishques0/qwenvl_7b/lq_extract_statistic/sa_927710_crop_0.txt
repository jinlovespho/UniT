gt_text: SPORT
vlm_output: 81%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPORT" and the VLM OCR output is "81%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "81%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "SPORT".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SPORT". The OCR output has "81%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. However, "81%" doesn't contain the word "SPORT" in any form. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "81%" is a number, not the word "SPORT". There are no typos here because "81%" isn't even a typo of "SPORT"; it's a completely different type of data.

Since there are no matching words from the ground truth in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated to the ground truth text.
