gt_text: AirAsia
vlm_output: AirAsia

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "AirAsia" and the VLM OCR output is also "AirAsia". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, the comparison step. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "AirAsia". The OCR output is "AirAsia", which is exactly the same. Even if there were a typo, like "AirAsia" vs "AirAsia" (which there isn't), it would still count as a match. Since the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly, all unique words (just one here) are present. 

So according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. Everything matches perfectly.
