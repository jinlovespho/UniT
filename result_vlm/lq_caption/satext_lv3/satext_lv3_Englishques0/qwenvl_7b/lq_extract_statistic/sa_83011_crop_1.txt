gt_text: CJ03ADM
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "CJ03ADM" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, the ground truth is "CJ03ADM". Let me break down the steps as outlined.

Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But wait, the ground truth is a single string "CJ03ADM". However, the OCR output is "100%". The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth here is a single word, right? So the unique words in the ground truth would just be "CJ03ADM".

Now, the OCR output is "100%", which is a different string. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "CJ03ADM" has no punctuation, and "100%" has a percent sign. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so maybe the percent sign is ignored. But then, the OCR output is "100%", which after removing punctuation would be "100". The ground truth is "CJ03ADM". Are these considered to have any overlapping words? Let's see.

But the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CJ03ADM". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. So, the OCR output doesn't contain "CJ03ADM" in any form. Even if we ignore case and punctuation, "100%" doesn't match "CJ03ADM". There's no overlap in the words. So according to the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word in ground truth, and it's not in the OCR output, this is not the case.

2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match. But since there are no matches, this doesn't apply.

3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. The OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated to "CJ03ADM", so this would be category 3.

Wait, but the problem mentions "small typos still count as matches." However, in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output is completely different. So, even with typos, there's no match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 8
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 10
