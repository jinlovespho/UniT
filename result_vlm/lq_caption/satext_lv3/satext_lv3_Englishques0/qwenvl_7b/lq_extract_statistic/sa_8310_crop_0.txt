gt_text: DEVEREUX
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DEVEREUX" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "DEVEREUX", which is a name, probably a surname.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring word order, case, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not a word. The ground truth is "DEVEREUX", which is a single word. 

So, looking at the unique words in the ground truth: there's only one word, "DEVEREUX". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "DEVEREUX" or any of its variations (like lowercase or with typos), there's no match. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, the OCR output has none of the ground truth words.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all. But there are no matches here.
3 — Incorrect: no words match or output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "DEVEREUX", this falls under category 3.

I think the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 10
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 13
