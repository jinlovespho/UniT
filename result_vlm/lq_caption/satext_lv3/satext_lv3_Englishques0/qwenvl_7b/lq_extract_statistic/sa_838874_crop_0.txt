Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PKL" and the VLM OCR output is also "PKL". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors.

First, word order doesn't matter. Since both are just three letters, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PKL". The OCR output is the same, so the set matches exactly. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There's no typo here because they're identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "PKL" is exactly the same in both, it should be correct. I think the answer is 1.
