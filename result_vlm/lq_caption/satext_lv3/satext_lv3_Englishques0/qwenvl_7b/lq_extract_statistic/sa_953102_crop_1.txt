Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "95" and the VLM OCR output is also "95". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "95", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this with the ground truth considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "95". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "95" because it's a single number. The OCR output is exactly the same: "95". So, when comparing, since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, and considering that small typos are still matches, there's no issue here. Also, there's no difference in capitalization or spacing because there's only one word. The order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word, order isn't a factor here.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has that same word, this meets Category 1. There's no case where only part of the words match, so Category 2 doesn't apply. And obviously, it's not Category 3 because there's a match.

So, the answer should be 1.
