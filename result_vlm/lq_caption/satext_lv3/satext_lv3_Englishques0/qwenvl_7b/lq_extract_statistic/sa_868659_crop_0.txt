gt_text: STOP
vlm_output: 1978

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "STOP" and the VLM OCR output is "1978". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1978", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "STOP", which is a word. 

Now step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "STOP". The OCR output has numbers, not letters. 

Wait, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the OCR output is numbers, which are not letters. So there's no overlap in characters. Also, the category definitions say that category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "STOP" is letters and the OCR output is numbers, there's no match. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1978" has no letters, it's unrelated to "STOP". Therefore, it should be category 3. 

But wait, the instruction mentions small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no letters at all. So even typos aren't applicable here. So the answer is 3.
