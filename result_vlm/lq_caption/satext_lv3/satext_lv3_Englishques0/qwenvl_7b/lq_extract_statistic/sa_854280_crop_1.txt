gt_text: TROPEZ
vlm_output: SAINT TROPEZ

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TROPEZ" and the VLM OCR output is "SAINT TROPEZ". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SAINT TROPEZ". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "TROPEZ". 

The instructions say to consider word order as not important. So, I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TROPEZ". The OCR output has two words: "SAINT" and "TROPEZ". 

Next, I need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's word "TROPEZ" is present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "SAINT", isn't part of the ground truth. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, we only care about "TROPEZ" here.

The instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches. In this case, there's no typo; "TROPEZ" is exactly as in the ground truth. Also, we ignore capitalization and spacing. The OCR output has "TROPEZ" correctly, even though it's part of a longer phrase.

So, since the OCR output includes the ground truth word "TROPEZ", even though there's an extra word "SAINT", the category should be 1 — Correct, because all unique ground truth words are present. The presence of an extra word doesn't affect the category as long as all required words are there. The problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces and other factors. So, the answer should be 1.
