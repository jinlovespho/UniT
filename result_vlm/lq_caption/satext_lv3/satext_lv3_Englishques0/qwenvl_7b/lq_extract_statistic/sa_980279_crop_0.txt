gt_text: D
vlm_output: 3986 D

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "D" and the VLM OCR output is "3986 D". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "3986 D". So the text content would be the words present here. But wait, the problem says to extract the text content, but does that include numbers? The ground truth is just the letter "D". The OCR output has "3986" and "D". 

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. We need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "D". 

The OCR output has two parts: "3986" and "D". But the ground truth doesn't have "3986", so the unique words in the OCR output are "3986" and "D". However, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, does that mean we check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output? 

The ground truth has the word "D". The OCR output has "D" as well. The "3986" is not part of the ground truth. So even though the OCR output has an extra number, as long as the "D" is present, it should be considered correct. 

Also, the instructions mention to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, the OCR output has "D" which matches the ground truth exactly. The number "3986" is irrelevant here because the ground truth doesn't include it. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. 
Since the ground truth has only "D" and the OCR output has "D", this would be category 1. 

But wait, does the OCR output's "3986" affect this? The problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we're only checking if the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output might have extra words, but as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

So even though there's an extra "3986", the "D" is there. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
