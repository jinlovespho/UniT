gt_text: Toilets
vlm_output: BUTTERFLIES

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Toilets" and the VLM OCR output is "BUTTERFLIES". I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is "BUTTERFLIES". 

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Toilets". Let's break down the comparison rules.

First, word order doesn't matter. So we don't have to check the sequence. Then, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Toilets". The OCR output has one word: "BUTTERFLIES".

Next, ignore capitalization. So "BUTTERFLIES" becomes "butterflies" and "Toilets" becomes "toilets". Then, ignore punctuation and spaces. There's no punctuation here, and only one word each. Also, small typos still count as matches. But here, "butterflies" vs. "toilets" – they are completely different words. There's no typo that would make them similar. 

So the unique word in the ground truth is "toilets", and the OCR output has "butterflies". Since they don't match, even considering typos, there's no overlap. Therefore, the category would be 3, because none of the unique words match. The output is unrelated. 

Wait, but the category 3 says "no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since "butterflies" isn't related to "toilets", it's unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
