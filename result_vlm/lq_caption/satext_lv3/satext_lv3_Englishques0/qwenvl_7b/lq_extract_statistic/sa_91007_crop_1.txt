gt_text: FURLA
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FURLA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is the word "FURLA". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not the word "FURLA". 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "FURLA". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. There's no mention of the word "FURLA" in the OCR output. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "FURLA" in any way. The OCR output is entirely different, not even a partial match. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's no match here, it's not 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches, so it's not 2. That leaves Category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
