Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "FM" and the OCR output is "AMFM". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "AMFM", which is just letters. Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "FM". Wait, but "FM" is a single word here, right? So the unique words in the ground truth are just "FM".

Now, the OCR output is "AMFM". Let me process this. The instructions say to ignore word order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"FM"}.

Looking at the OCR output, "AMFM" – if we split into words, but there's no spaces. Wait, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but how are the words split here? The ground truth is "FM" as a single word. The OCR output is "AMFM" – maybe it's considered as one word. But maybe the OCR output could be split into "AM" and "FM"? Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "FM" as the only unique word. The OCR output's words need to contain "FM" as a substring or as a word? Wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth" – so the ground truth is "FM", which is one word. The OCR output is "AMFM", which is one word. But does "AMFM" contain "FM" as a substring? If we're considering exact matches, but the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. Wait, but the OCR output is "AMFM" and the ground truth is "FM". So maybe the OCR output has "FM" as part of the word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "AMFM" as a single word, does that count as containing "FM"? Or do we need exact word matches?

Wait, the instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has "FM" as a word. The OCR output's words need to include "FM" as a word. But if the OCR output is "AMFM" as a single word, then it's not exactly "FM". But the instructions also say that small typos still count as matches. But "AMFM" isn't a typo of "FM"; it's longer. Wait, but maybe the OCR output is supposed to be split into words. But since there are no spaces, maybe it's considered as one word. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is "AMFM" which could be split into "AM" and "FM" if we consider splitting on letters? No, that's not standard. Typically, words are split by spaces, but if there are no spaces, it's considered as a single word. So "AMFM" is one word. Then, does that contain "FM" as a substring? But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "FM". The OCR output's words are "AMFM" – which is not "FM", but if we consider that "AMFM" contains "FM" as a substring, does that count? But the instructions don't mention substring matches; they mention exact matches with typos allowed. Wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had "Fm" or "fM" or "FM", that would be a match. But "AMFM" is not "FM", it's longer. So maybe it's not a match. However, maybe the OCR output is supposed to have "FM" as part of it. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "FM" as a word, then it's a match. But in this case, the OCR output is "AMFM" as a single word. So unless the OCR output is split into words, which in this case, without spaces, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "AMFM" which is two words: "AM" and "FM"? But that would require splitting on letters, which isn't standard. The problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but that doesn't mean splitting words into parts. So perhaps the OCR output is considered as one word, "AMFM", which doesn't match the ground truth's "FM". Therefore, the unique words in the OCR output are {"AMFM"}, which doesn't include "FM". Therefore, the answer would be category 3, since no words match. But wait, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. But "AMFM" isn't a typo of "FM"; it's longer. So maybe there's no match. Therefore, category 3. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the splitting. If the OCR output is "AMFM", and the ground truth is "FM", perhaps the OCR output contains "FM" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So unless the OCR output is split into "AM" and "FM", which would be the case if the OCR output is "AM FM" (with a space), but in this case, it's "AMFM" without a space. So maybe it's not split. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain "FM" as a word. Hence, category 3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have "FM" as part of the text, and since the ground truth is "FM", even if it's part of a longer word, it counts. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output has "FM" as a word, then yes. But if it's part of a longer word, does that count? The instructions don't specify that. So maybe it's not considered a match. Therefore, the answer is category 3. But wait, the user might have intended that "AMFM" contains "FM" as a substring, so it's a match. But according to the given categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "FM", and the OCR output has "AMFM", which includes "FM" as a substring, but not as a standalone word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single word, then it doesn't contain "FM" as a word. So no match. Hence, category 3. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have "FM" as part of the text, and the problem allows for that. However, the instructions don't mention substring matches. So I think the correct answer is category 3 because the OCR output doesn't contain the exact word "FM" as per the ground truth. Therefore, no matches, so category 3.
