gt_text: ADMINISTRATION
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ADMINISTRATION" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "ADMINISTRATION". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ADMINISTRATION". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "ADMINISTRATION" or any variation of it. The OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated in terms of words. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which isn't a word. The ground truth is a single word, and the OCR output doesn't have any matching words. 

Since there's no match for the unique ground truth word, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words.
