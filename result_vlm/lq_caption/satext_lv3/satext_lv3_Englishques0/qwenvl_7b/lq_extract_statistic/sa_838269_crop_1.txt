Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "Google", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output is exactly the same. So even if there were typos, like "Goggle" or something, it would still count as a match because small typos are allowed. But here, it's exactly correct. 

So the category is 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There's only one word, and it's a perfect match. No issues with case, spacing, or order. So the answer should be 1.
