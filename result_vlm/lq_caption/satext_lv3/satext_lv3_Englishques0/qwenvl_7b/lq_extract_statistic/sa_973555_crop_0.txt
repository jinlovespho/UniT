Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "AMP".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "AMP", which is one word. The OCR output is also "AMP", so the unique words match.

Then, the rules about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since both are all caps and no spaces or punctuation, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because they're exactly the same.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word, and it's present, that's a Category 1. The other categories don't apply because there's no partial match or no matches. So the answer should be 1.
