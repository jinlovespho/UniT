gt_text: ZONE
vlm_output: NO FLY ZONE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZONE" and the VLM OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NO FLY ZONE". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is "ZONE".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I don't have to check the sequence of words. Next, I should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just "ZONE", so the unique word is "ZONE".

Now, the OCR output has three words: "NO", "FLY", and "ZONE". The unique words here are "NO", "FLY", and "ZONE". 

Comparing the ground truth's unique words to the OCR's, "ZONE" is present in both. The other words in the OCR output ("NO", "FLY") are not part of the ground truth. But according to the criteria, we only need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "ZONE" is there, even though there are extra words, that's okay. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output's "ZONE" is in uppercase, same as the ground truth, so that's fine. There's no punctuation here, so that's not an issue. The extra words "NO" and "FLY" are allowed since we're only checking for the presence of the ground truth words. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has the exact word "ZONE" as in the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "ZONE") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
