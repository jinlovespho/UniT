gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "BUT", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are just one word, so order isn't an issue.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case since both are the same.

Looking at the categories:
1 is Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "BUT", which is the same as the ground truth, all unique words (just one) are present. So this should be category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The output matches exactly, so it's a correct match. No partial or incorrect elements. The answer should be 1.
