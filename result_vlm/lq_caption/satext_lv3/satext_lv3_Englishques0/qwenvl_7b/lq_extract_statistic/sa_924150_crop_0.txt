gt_text: New
vlm_output: FIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "New" and the VLM OCR output is "FIT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "FIT", which is straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "New", and the OCR output has "FIT". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, so that's not a factor here. 

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "New". The OCR output has "FIT". I need to check if "FIT" matches "New" under the given conditions. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but "FIT" and "New" are completely different words. There's no overlap in letters or any possible typo that would make them the same. 

Also, we have to ignore capitalization, but "New" is capitalized and "FIT" is all caps, but even if we make them lowercase, "new" vs "fit" are still different. Punctuation and spacing aren't an issue here since both are single words without any. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match at all, so it's not partially correct or fully correct.
