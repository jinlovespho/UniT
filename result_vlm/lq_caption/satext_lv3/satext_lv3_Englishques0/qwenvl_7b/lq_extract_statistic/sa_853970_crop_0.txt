Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "8", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "100%". Then, compare it with the ground truth "8".

The categories are based on the set of unique words. The ground truth has only one unique word: "8". The OCR output has "100%". Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. But here, "100%" and "8" are different. 

Wait, the ground truth is just "8". The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. The unique words in the ground truth are {"8"}, and in the OCR output, it's {"100%"}.

So, do "100%" and "8" count as matching? The problem says that small typos still count as matches. But "100%" is not a typo of "8"; it's a different number. So there's no match here. The OCR output doesn't have the word "8" in it. 

Therefore, since none of the unique ground truth words (which is just "8") are present in the OCR output, it would fall into category 3: Incorrect. Because there are no matches. Even though the OCR output is a number, it's not the same as the ground truth. So category 3.
