gt_text: SPIETH
vlm_output: SPIETH

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "SPIETH" and a VLM OCR output "SPIETH". They want me to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SPIETH", which is already text, so that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "SPIETH", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "SPIETH". Let's break down the comparison.

Since both are the same exact word, ignoring case (though both are uppercase here), and there are no typos, the OCR output perfectly matches the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SPIETH", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match here, so Categories 2 or 3 don't apply. The answer should be 1.
