Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "52093" and the VLM OCR output is also "52093". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "52093", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both texts are the same.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is a single number, "52093", which is a string of digits. Since there's only one "word" (assuming a word here is any sequence of characters separated by spaces, but in this case, there are no spaces), the unique words in the ground truth are just {"52093"}.

Now, checking the OCR output, it's also "52093", so the set of unique words is the same. The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both texts are exactly the same, there's nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, this fits Category 1. 

I don't see any partial matches or missing words here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
