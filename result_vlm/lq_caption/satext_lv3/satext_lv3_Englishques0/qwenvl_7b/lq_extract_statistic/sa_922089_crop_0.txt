Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "110" and the VLM OCR output is "2013". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2013", so that's straightforward. The ground truth is "110". 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, it says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "110", which is a single number. But the OCR output is "2013", which is another number. 

But how do these numbers compare? The unique words in the ground truth are just "110". The OCR output is "2013", which is a different number. However, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But "110" and "2013" aren't typos of each other. They are completely different numbers. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the step. The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "110". The OCR output has one word: "2013". Since "2013" isn't "110", even with typos, there's no match. 

Also, the categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. 
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all match. 
3 — Incorrect if none match or output is wrong.

In this case, the ground truth has one unique word ("110") and the OCR output has a different word ("2013"). So there's no match. Therefore, it should be category 3. 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are numbers considered as words here? The problem says "unique words", but "110" and "2013" are numbers. If the OCR output is a number that's not the same as the ground truth, even if it's a different number, then there's no match. 

Alternatively, could there be a typo where "2013" is a mistake for "110"? For example, if the OCR misread "110" as "2013", but that seems like a larger error, not a small typo. The instructions say small typos count, but "2013" vs "110" isn't a small typo. 

Therefore, since there's no match between the unique words, the category is 3.
