gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: FRUIT

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "FRUIT", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the word "FRUIT" (all caps), and the OCR output is the same. Since both are exactly the same, even though they're all caps, the comparison ignores capitalization. But in this case, they are the same. Also, there's only one unique word in the ground truth, which is "FRUIT". The OCR output has that same word. 

So checking the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, that's category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output has exactly the same word. No typos, no missing words. So the answer should be 1.
