gt_text: ART
vlm_output: ART

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ART" and the VLM OCR output is also "ART". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "ART".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has the word "ART". The OCR output is exactly "ART". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "ART". The OCR output has the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the order doesn't matter here since there's only one word. Also, capitalization is the same, so no issues there. No typos either. So it's a perfect match. The answer should be 1.
