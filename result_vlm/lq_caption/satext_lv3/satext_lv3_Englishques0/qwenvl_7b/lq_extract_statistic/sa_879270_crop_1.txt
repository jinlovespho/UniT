gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: EVERGREEN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "EVERGREEN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "EVERGREEN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the OCR output.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are based on whether all unique words from ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Now, the ground truth has the word "EVERGREEN". The OCR output is exactly "EVERGREEN". Since both are the same, even if we ignore case, spacing, etc., they are identical. So the unique words in ground truth (which is just "EVERGREEN") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this is a correct match. There are no typos, no missing words, and the only word is present. So the answer should be category 1.
