<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLM" and the VLM OCR output is "9H-PLM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "9H-PLM". So the extracted text would be "9H-PLM". 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, following the given rules. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "PLM", which is a single word. But wait, the OCR output has "9H-PLM". Let me think about how to break this down.

The ground truth is "PLM", which is one unique word. The OCR output is "9H-PLM". Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

So, the OCR output has "9H-PLM". Let's split it into parts. The hyphen might be considered as punctuation, which we can ignore. So "9H-PLM" could be split into "9H" and "PLM". But the ground truth is "PLM". 

Wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "PLM". The OCR output has "9H-PLM". If we remove punctuation (the hyphen), does that split it into "9H" and "PLM"? But the hyphen is part of the OCR output. However, the rule says to ignore punctuation. So maybe the hyphen is removed, leaving "9HPLM"? But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as a single string, and we check if "PLM" is present as a substring, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing.

Wait, the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". The ground truth is "PLM", which is one word. So the OCR output needs to contain that word, possibly with other characters, but considering that we can ignore punctuation and extra spaces. 

In the OCR output "9H-PLM", if we remove the hyphen (punctuation) and any other non-alphanumeric characters, we get "9HPLM". But the ground truth is "PLM". However, the problem says to ignore punctuation, so maybe the hyphen is ignored, and the OCR output is treated as "9HPLM". But the original ground truth is "PLM". So does "9HPLM" contain "PLM"? Yes, as a substring. However, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, "9HPLM" has extra characters before "PLM". However, the instruction says that the OCR output is compared to the ground truth by considering the set of unique words. 

Wait, maybe the OCR output is split into words. If the OCR output is "9H-PLM", splitting by spaces (but there are none), but maybe by hyphens? If we split on hyphens, we get "9H" and "PLM". Then, the set of words in the OCR output would be {"9H", "PLM"}. The ground truth is {"PLM"}. So, the OCR output contains "PLM" as one of its words. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "PLM") are present in the OCR output. 

But wait, the hyphen is part of the OCR output. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. So the hyphen is considered punctuation and is ignored. So the OCR output is "9HPLM" (without the hyphen). Then, the words would be "9HPLM". But that's a single word. However, the ground truth is "PLM". So the OCR output's word is "9HPLM", which includes "PLM" as a substring. But the rules say that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output's word is longer than the ground truth. 

Wait, but the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "PLM" as a unique word. The OCR output has "9H-PLM" which, after removing punctuation (hyphen), becomes "9HPLM". If we consider "9HPLM" as a single word, does it contain "PLM"? If the rule is that the OCR output must have the exact words (but allowing for typos, etc.), then "9HPLM" is not exactly "PLM", but it contains "PLM" as a substring. However, the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So if the OCR output has "PLM" as a word (ignoring punctuation and spacing), then it's a match. 

But in this case, the OCR output is "9H-PLM". If we split by hyphen, we get "9H" and "PLM". So the OCR output has "PLM" as a separate word. Therefore, the set of words in OCR is {"9H", "PLM"}, and the ground truth is {"PLM"}. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. Hence, category 1.

Wait, but the hyphen is part of the OCR output. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. So the hyphen is removed. So "9H-PLM" becomes "9HPLM". But if we split into words, perhaps by spaces (but there are none), then it's one word. But the ground truth is "PLM". So "9HPLM" contains "PLM" as a substring, but is that considered a match? 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as a string, and we check if all the words from the ground truth are present as substrings, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. 

But the problem states: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth's unique words are {"PLM"}. The OCR output's words, after processing (removing punctuation, ignoring case, etc.), should include "PLM". 

In the OCR output "9H-PLM", if we remove the hyphen (punctuation), we get "9HPLM". Now, if we split this into words (assuming words are separated by spaces, but there are none), it's a single word. But the ground truth is "PLM". However, the OCR output's word is "9HPLM", which is not exactly "PLM", but contains it. However, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output has "9HPLM", which is not a typo but an addition of characters. 

Wait, but the instruction says that "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had "PLM" with a small typo like "PLM" vs "PLM", that's a match. But in this case, the OCR output has "9HPLM" which is not a typo but an addition. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. But here, the OCR output has extra characters (9H) before "PLM". 

But the instruction says "ignore extra/missing spaces" but not other characters. Wait, the instruction says: "Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So, the OCR output's "9H-PLM" would have the hyphen (punctuation) removed, and any extra spaces (but there are none here). So the OCR output becomes "9HPLM". Now, the ground truth is "PLM". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains "PLM" as a word (after processing), then it's a match. However, "9HPLM" is not "PLM", but it's possible that the OCR output has "PLM" as part of a longer word. But according to the rules, the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is split into words by whitespace, but in this case, there's no whitespace. So the entire "9HPLM" is considered as one word. Since the ground truth is "PLM", which is a substring of "9HPLM", but not an exact word. However, the rules don't mention substrings, only exact words (with possible typos). 

But the problem says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had "PLM" with a typo like "PLM" vs "PLM", that's okay. But in this case, the OCR output has "9HPLM", which is not a typo but an addition. So does that count as a match? 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, the instruction says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "PLM" (one word). The OCR output, after processing (removing punctuation and spaces), is "9HPLM". If "9HPLM" is considered as a single word, then it doesn't exactly match "PLM". But perhaps the OCR output is supposed to have the exact word, but with possible typos. However, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had "PLM" with a typo like "PLM" (but same letters), that's okay. But here, the OCR output has "9HPLM", which is not a typo but an addition. 

Wait, but the OCR output is "9H-PLM". If we ignore the hyphen (punctuation), then it's "9HPLM". However, the ground truth is "PLM". So "9HPLM" contains "PLM" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output's processed text contains "PLM" as a word, then it's a match. But if it's part of a longer word, does that count? 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is split into words by any non-alphanumeric characters, but that's not specified. 

This is a bit confusing. However, given that the OCR output is "9H-PLM" and the ground truth is "PLM", the hyphen is ignored, and "PLM" is present as a substring. If the rules allow for that, then it's a correct match. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "PLM" as a word, then it's correct. 

But in the OCR output, after removing punctuation, it's "9HPLM", which is not the same as "PLM", but contains it. However, the rules don't mention substrings, only exact words with possible typos. So if the OCR output had "PLM" with a typo, like "PLM", that's okay. But in this case, it's "9HPLM", which is not a typo but an addition. 

But maybe the hyphen is considered as a separator. For example, "9H-PLM" could be split into "9H" and "PLM" by the hyphen. If we ignore the hyphen (punctuation), then the words are "9H" and "PLM". Then, the OCR output has "PLM" as a word, which matches the ground truth. Therefore, category 1. 

This seems more plausible. So splitting the OCR output by hyphen (as punctuation) gives two words: "9H" and "PLM". Then, the set of words in the OCR output is {"9H", "PLM"}, and the ground truth is {"PLM"}. So all unique ground truth words are present. Hence, category 1.
