Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "3" and the VLM OCR output is also "3". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "3".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are just "3", so order isn't an issue here.

The comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "3". The OCR output also has "3". 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since there are no capitals, punctuation, or spaces here, that doesn't affect the comparison.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are exactly the same.

Looking at the categories:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "3" and the OCR output has "3", this condition is met.
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all match. But here, all do match.
3 — Incorrect if none match or the output is wrong. Not the case here.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
