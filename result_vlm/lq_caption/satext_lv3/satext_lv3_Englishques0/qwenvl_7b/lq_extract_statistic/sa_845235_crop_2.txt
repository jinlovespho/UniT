Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GALLERY" and the VLM OCR output is also "GALLERY". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "GALLERY", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "GALLERY". The OCR output is exactly the same. So, even though they are the same, I need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it matches, that should be category 1. 

Wait, but what if there were multiple words? For example, if the ground truth was "GALLERY ART" and the OCR was "gallery art", then it would still be category 1. But here, it's just one word. So, the OCR output has the same word. So, all unique words (just "GALLERY") are present. Therefore, category 1 is correct. 

No typos, same capitalization, same spacing. So, everything checks out. The answer should be 1.
