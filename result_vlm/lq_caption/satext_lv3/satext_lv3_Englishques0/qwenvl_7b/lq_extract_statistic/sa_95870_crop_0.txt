gt_text: Wolt
vlm_output: Wolt

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Wolt" and the VLM OCR output is also "Wolt". 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "Wolt".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it would still count. But here, they are the same. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has one word, "Wolt", and the OCR output also has "Wolt", that's a match.

We also need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. The note says small typos still count as matches. Even if there was a typo, like "Wolte" or "Wolt", it's considered a match. But here, there's no typo.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
