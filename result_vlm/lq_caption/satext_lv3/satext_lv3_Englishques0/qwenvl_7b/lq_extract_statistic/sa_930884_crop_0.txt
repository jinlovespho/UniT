gt_text: AIRWAYS
vlm_output: ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "AIRWAYS" and the VLM OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". I should process this text according to the instructions. The next step is comparing it with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "AIRWAYS", which is a single word. So the unique words in ground truth are just {"AIRWAYS"}.

Now, the OCR output has "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Let's break this down. The OCR output might be a concatenation of words. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth has only one word: "AIRWAYS". So the OCR output needs to contain that word, possibly with typos, ignoring case, spacing, etc.

But the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Let me check if "AIRWAYS" is present here. Let's see: "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Breaking it down, maybe "AIRWAYS" is part of it. Let me check the letters. The OCR output has "AIRWAYS" in there. Let me look: E-T-I-H-A-D-A-I-R-W-A-Y-S-P-A-R-T-N-E-R. So the sequence A-I-R-W-A-Y-S is present. That's "AIRWAYS" exactly. So the OCR output contains "AIRWAYS" as a substring. However, the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER", which is "ETIHAD" + "AIRWAYS" + "PARTNER". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "AIRWAYS", the OCR output must contain that word. However, the OCR output is a single string. Are we splitting the OCR output into words? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth's unique words are {"AIRWAYS"}. The OCR output's words need to include "AIRWAYS" (considering possible typos, case, spacing, etc.)

But the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". If we split this into words, perhaps it's "ETIHAD", "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER". But maybe the OCR didn't split it into words, and it's a single string. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains "AIRWAYS" as a substring, even if it's part of a longer string, does that count?

Wait, the problem says "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth is "AIRWAYS" (one word). The OCR output must have that word. But the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". If we consider that the OCR output may have merged words, but the actual text is "ETIHAD AIRWAYS PARTNER" (assuming that the OCR output is a single string without spaces), but the problem says to ignore extra or missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER", but the actual intended words are "ETIHAD", "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER", then "AIRWAYS" is present. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is only "AIRWAYS", the OCR output must contain that word. If "AIRWAYS" is present in the OCR output (as a substring, possibly with typos), then it's a match.

But in this case, the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER", which includes "AIRWAYS" as a substring. However, the OCR output might have merged words. But the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So even if the OCR output is a single string without spaces, as long as the words from the ground truth are present (with possible typos, case, etc.), it counts.

So the OCR output contains "AIRWAYS" as part of the string. Therefore, the unique word from the ground truth is present. Hence, category 1: Correct. Because all unique ground truth words (only "AIRWAYS") are present in the OCR output, considering the allowed variations (case, spacing, typos). Even if the OCR output has other words like "ETIHAD" and "PARTNER", the presence of "AIRWAYS" is sufficient for category 1.

Wait, but the problem says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has one unique word: "AIRWAYS". The OCR output needs to contain that word. The OCR output does contain "AIRWAYS" as part of the string. Therefore, the answer is category 1.
