Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40" and the VLM OCR output is also "40". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "40".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth is "40", which is a single word. The OCR output is the same. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue with typos, order, or spacing. The unique words in the ground truth are just "40", and the OCR output has that exact word. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1. There's no possibility of partial matches here because there's only one word. So the category is definitely 1.
