gt_text: NEMOURS
vlm_output: MEMBERS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "NEMOURS" and the VLM OCR output is "MEMBERS". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "MEMBERS". Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth, considering certain factors.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "NEMOURS", which is one word. The OCR output is "MEMBERS", also one word. 

Next, I need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to consider here. 

Then, small typos still count as matches. But here, "NEMOURS" vs. "MEMBERS" – are they typos of each other? Let me think. The words are different. "NEMOURS" is a proper noun, maybe a name or a place. "MEMBERS" is a plural noun. They don't seem to be typos of each other. For example, if the OCR had "NEMOORS" that might be a typo of "NEMOURS", but "MEMBERS" is a different word entirely. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are {"NEMOURS"}, and the OCR output has {"MEMBERS"}. Since there's no overlap, even considering typos, it seems like there's no match. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
