gt_text: Phoenix
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "Phoenix" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Phoenix". Now, the comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word in each, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Phoenix".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "10%", which has a percentage sign. The ground truth is "Phoenix", which is a proper noun. So, there's no capitalization to consider here since both are lowercase if we ignore case, but "Phoenix" is capitalized in the ground truth. However, the rule says to ignore capitalization, so maybe that's not a factor. But the OCR output has "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign, not a word.
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output is entirely different.

Now, the categories are:

1. Correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has "Phoenix", but the OCR output has "10%". These are not the same. So, no match here.

2. Slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, this category doesn't apply.

3. Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output "10%" is unrelated to "Phoenix". So this would fall under category 3.

Wait, but maybe I need to check if there's any possible overlap. "Phoenix" is a city, a bird, etc. But "10%" is a percentage. They don't share any common words. The OCR output has no words that match "Phoenix" even with typos. So, no matches. Hence, category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 76
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 166
