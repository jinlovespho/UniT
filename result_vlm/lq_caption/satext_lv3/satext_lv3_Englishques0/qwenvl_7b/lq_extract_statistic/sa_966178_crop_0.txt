gt_text: STRASBOURG
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "STRASBOURG" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970". Then, step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "STRASBOURG", which is a city name. 

The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let's break them down. Word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth here is a single word: "STRASBOURG". So the unique words in the ground truth are just that one word.

The OCR output is "1970", which is a number. The instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "1970" is a number, not a word. Also, the ground truth is a proper noun, a city name. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But the OCR output has "1970", which is a number. There's no overlap with "STRASBOURG". Even if we consider typos, "1970" doesn't resemble "STRASBOURG" in any way. They are completely different. So there are no matching words. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, this doesn't apply. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match, or the output is unrelated or empty. The OCR output is "1970", which is unrelated to the ground truth. So this should be category 3.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. The OCR output is a number, but could "1970" be a typo for "STRASBOURG"? For example, maybe the OCR misread letters as numbers? But "STRASBOURG" has letters S, T, R, A, S, B, O, U, R, G. The OCR output is numbers, so there's no letters here. Even with typos, numbers can't be confused with letters in this case. So there's no possible match. Therefore, the answer is 3.
