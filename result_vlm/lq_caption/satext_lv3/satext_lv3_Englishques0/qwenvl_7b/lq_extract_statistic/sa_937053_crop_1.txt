gt_text: Flowers
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Flowers" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "Flowers".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Flowers". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. There's no mention of the word "Flowers" or any similar typos. Even if I consider "100%" as a number, it's not related to the word "Flowers". 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, even after considering possible typos or ignoring case and spacing, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match here. The output is unrelated to the ground truth text.
