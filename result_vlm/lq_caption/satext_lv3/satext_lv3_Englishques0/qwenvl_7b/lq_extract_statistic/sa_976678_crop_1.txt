gt_text: MERIDIANAS
vlm_output: SAILING

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MERIDIANAS" and the VLM OCR output is "SAILING". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SAILING", so that's straightforward. 

Next, step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. Also, we're only comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "MERIDIANAS", which is a single word. So the unique words here are just "MERIDIANAS".

Now, the comparison needs to consider ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "SAILING", all caps, but the ground truth is also all caps. However, the actual letters are different. The ground truth word is "MERIDIANAS" and the OCR output is "SAILING". 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the words are completely different. "MERIDIANAS" vs. "SAILING" – there's no overlap in letters. So even if we ignore case, the letters don't match. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't contain that word (even with possible typos), then there are no matches. Therefore, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." 

So the answer should be category 3.
