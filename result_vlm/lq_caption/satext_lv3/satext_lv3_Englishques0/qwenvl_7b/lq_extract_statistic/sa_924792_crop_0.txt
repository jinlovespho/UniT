gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "FRUIT", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Now step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT". 

The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. The question is whether "100%" is considered a match for "FRUIT" under the given conditions. 

The instructions mention that we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which isn't a word. The ground truth is the word "FRUIT". 

Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo—there's a complete mismatch. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The unique word in the ground truth is "FRUIT", and the OCR output has "100%", which isn't a word that's related. 

So according to the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, none of the words from the ground truth are present. So it's not category 1. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present, that's not the case either. 

Category 3 is incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. In this case, the OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated to "FRUIT". So it should be category 3.
