gt_text: FURLA
vlm_output: 1024

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FURLA" and the VLM OCR output is "1024". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1024", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FURLA", which is a word, probably a brand name or something. 

Now Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is numbers, and the ground truth is letters. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "FURLA". The OCR output is "1024", which is numbers. Since the OCR output doesn't contain any letters, there's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, but "1024" isn't a typo of "FURLA". The letters and numbers are different. So, there are no matching words. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR. Here, none are. Category 2 is if at least one but not all. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth and it's not present, that's not the case. Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is numbers and the ground truth is letters, they are unrelated. So, category 3.
