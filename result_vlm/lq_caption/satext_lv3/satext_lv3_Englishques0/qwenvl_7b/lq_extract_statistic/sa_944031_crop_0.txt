Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is also "105". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "105".

Next, compare with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, we look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "105". The OCR output also has "105". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there's no typo here, it's a perfect match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Here, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. So the category should be 1.
