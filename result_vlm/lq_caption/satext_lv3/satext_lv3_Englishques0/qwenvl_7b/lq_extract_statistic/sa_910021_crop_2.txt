gt_text: HEUNG-
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HEUNG-", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a statement that there's no English text visible. So the extracted text here is "The image does not contain any visible English text."

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HEUNG-", which is a proper noun, possibly a name or a term. The OCR output doesn't mention any English text, which is a bit confusing because the ground truth is an English text. But according to the problem's instructions, we need to check if the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth.

Wait, the ground truth is just one word: "HEUNG-". The OCR output says there's no English text. So the OCR output's text is stating that there's no text, but the ground truth is that there is text. However, the OCR output didn't recognize it. 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, compare unique words from ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "HEUNG-". The OCR output's text is "The image does not contain any visible English text." So the OCR output's words are "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text." (with the period maybe, but we ignore punctuation). 

But the ground truth word is "HEUNG-", which isn't present in the OCR output. The OCR output is stating that there's no text, but the ground truth is that there is text. However, the OCR output didn't detect it. So the OCR output's text doesn't include "HEUNG-" or any variation. 

According to the categories: if none of the ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The ground truth has one unique word, which isn't in the OCR output. So the answer should be 3.
