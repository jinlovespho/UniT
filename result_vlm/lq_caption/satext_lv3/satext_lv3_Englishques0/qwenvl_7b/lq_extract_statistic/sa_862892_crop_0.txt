gt_text: BOTTEGA
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible text.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BOTTEGA", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible text." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence stating that there's no visible text in the image. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "BOTTEGA". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. The OCR output mentions "text" but the ground truth is "BOTTEGA", which isn't present anywhere in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output says there's no text, but the ground truth has "BOTTEGA", which is a word that's not in the OCR output. The OCR output is essentially saying there's no text, but the ground truth has text. So the OCR output is incorrect because it's claiming there's no text when there actually is. Therefore, the category should be 3 because there's no match. Even though the OCR output is a statement about the absence of text, it doesn't contain the actual word "BOTTEGA" or any of its variations. So the answer is 3.
