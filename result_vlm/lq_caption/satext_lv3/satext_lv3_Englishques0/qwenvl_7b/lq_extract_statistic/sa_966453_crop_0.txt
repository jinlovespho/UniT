gt_text: ARMY
vlm_output: ARMY

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARMY" and the VLM OCR output is also "ARMY". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "ARMY".

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The ground truth has one unique word: "ARMY". The OCR output also has "ARMY". 

Now, checking the criteria: unique words in ground truth. Since the OCR output has the same word, all unique words (which is just one) are present. The instructions mention ignoring case, but both are uppercase. There are no typos here, so that's fine. Also, no extra or missing spaces because it's a single word. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no partial matches here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
