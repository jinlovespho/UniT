gt_text: EC-LVP
vlm_output: Airbus

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EC-LVP" and the VLM OCR output is "Airbus". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "Airbus". Then compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "EC-LVP". Wait, but "EC-LVP" is probably a single term, maybe an acronym. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has one unique word: "EC-LVP".

Now, the OCR output is "Airbus", which is a different word. The problem says that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, "Airbus" isn't even close to "EC-LVP". There's no overlap in the words. The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "Airbus" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth ("EC-LVP"), and there's no partial matches either. The OCR output is completely different. So according to category 3, which is for no matches or unrelated, this should be category 3.
