gt_text: VOLUME
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VOLUME" and the OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. But the ground truth is "VOLUME", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage symbol and numbers.

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: there's only one word, "VOLUME". The OCR output has "100%", which is "100" and a percent sign. The words here are "100" and "%", but the ground truth doesn't have any of these. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output.
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect otherwise.

Since the ground truth has "VOLUME" and the OCR output has nothing matching that word (even considering typos, case, etc.), there's no match. The OCR output is unrelated. Therefore, it falls into category 3.
