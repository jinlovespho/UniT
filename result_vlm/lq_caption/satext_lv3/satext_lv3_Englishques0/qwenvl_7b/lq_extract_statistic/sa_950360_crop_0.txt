gt_text: Rodeo
vlm_output: Rodeo

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Rodeo" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rodeo". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Rodeo", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Rodeo". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are the same in this case. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, that should fall under category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if there were slight typos, like "Rodeo" vs "Rodeo", but they are the same here. So the answer is category 1.
