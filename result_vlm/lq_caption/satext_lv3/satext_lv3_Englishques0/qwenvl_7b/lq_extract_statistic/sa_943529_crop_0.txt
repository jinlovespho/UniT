gt_text: KONA
vlm_output: KONA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KONA" and the VLM OCR output is also "KONA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "KONA".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "KONA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are uppercase and have no punctuation or spaces. So they match exactly here. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; it's the same word.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, which they are. So the answer should be category 1.
