gt_text: GIRONA
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GIRONA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several conditions: word order doesn't matter, we only consider the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "GIRONA", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. Now, the key here is to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "GIRONA", we need to see if that word appears in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain the word "GIRONA" in any form. There's no mention of letters that could be a typo for "GIRONA" either. The OCR output is entirely numerical and a symbol, which doesn't match the expected word. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's not present, that's not the case. Category 2 is for partially correct, where at least one but not all match. However, in this case, there are no matches at all. Therefore, it falls under Category 3, which is incorrect when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

I should also check if there's any possible typo or alternative interpretation. For example, could "100%" be a typo for "GIRONA"? But "100%" is a number and percentage, which doesn't resemble the letters in "GIRONA". There's no overlap in characters that would count as a small typo. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of content and structure. 

Therefore, the correct category is 3.
