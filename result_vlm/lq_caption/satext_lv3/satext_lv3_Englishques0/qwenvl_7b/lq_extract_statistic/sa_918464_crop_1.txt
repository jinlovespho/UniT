gt_text: Epsom
vlm_output: Epsom

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Epsom" and the VLM OCR output is also "Epsom". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Epsom", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Epsom". The OCR output also has "Epsom". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Epsom") are present in the OCR output, this should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
