gt_text: Marshall
vlm_output: Marshall

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Marshall" and the VLM OCR output is also "Marshall". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Marshall".

Step 2 is to compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Marshall". The OCR output also has "Marshall". So they match exactly here.

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just "Marshall") are present. So the answer should be category 1.
