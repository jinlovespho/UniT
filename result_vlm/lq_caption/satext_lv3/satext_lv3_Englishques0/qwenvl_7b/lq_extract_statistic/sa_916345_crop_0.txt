gt_text: PEREYRA
vlm_output: 1920

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PEREYRA" and the VLM OCR output is "1920". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1920", which is a number. The ground truth is a name, "PEREYRA".

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PEREYRA". The OCR output is "1920", which is a number, not a word. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "1920" is a number, not a word. Also, the problem states that small typos still count as matches, but here there's no typo—there's no overlap in characters between "PEREYRA" and "1920". 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth (even considering case and spacing), and there's no match at all, the category should be 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any correct words.
