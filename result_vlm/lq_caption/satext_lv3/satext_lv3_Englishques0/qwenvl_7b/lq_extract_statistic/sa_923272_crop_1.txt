gt_text: BOSS
vlm_output: BOSS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BOSS" and the VLM OCR output is also "BOSS". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's "BOSS".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, we need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BOSS". The OCR output also has "BOSS". 

Now, check if they match considering case, spacing, etc. Both are uppercase, same word. No typos. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's exactly the same, the answer should be 1.
