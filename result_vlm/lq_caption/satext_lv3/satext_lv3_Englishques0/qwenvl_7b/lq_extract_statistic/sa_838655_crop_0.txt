gt_text: iPhone
vlm_output: iPhone

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "iPhone" and the VLM OCR output is also "iPhone". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "iPhone", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "iPhone". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned here, so that's not an issue. 

Since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "iPhone"), according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. 

I don't see any partial matches or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
