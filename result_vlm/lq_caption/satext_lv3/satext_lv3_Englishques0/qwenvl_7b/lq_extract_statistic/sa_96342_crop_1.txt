gt_text: 60
vlm_output: No Parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "60" and the VLM OCR output is "No Parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "No Parking". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "60", but the OCR output has "No Parking". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is just "60", which is a number. The OCR output has two words: "No" and "Parking". 

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "60". The OCR output has "No" and "Parking", which are different. There's no overlap in the words. Even if I consider typos, "60" isn't similar to "No" or "Parking". Also, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 3 - Incorrect.
