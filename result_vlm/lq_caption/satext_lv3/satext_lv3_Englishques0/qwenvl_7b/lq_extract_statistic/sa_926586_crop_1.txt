gt_text: SLQ2918H
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SLQ2918H" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has the word "SLQ2918H". The OCR output is "100". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "SLQ2918H", and the OCR output is "100", which is a different word. 

But wait, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. However, "SLQ2918H" and "100" are completely different. There's no overlap in characters or words. The OCR output is a number, while the ground truth is a mix of letters and numbers. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here, there's only one word in ground truth, which isn't present in OCR output). So category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. The OCR output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
