gt_text: DA

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DA" and the VLM OCR output is "2014". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "DA", which are letters. 

Now, comparing them according to the rules. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. However, the ground truth has "DA" as the only unique word. The OCR output is "2014", which is entirely numbers. 

Since "DA" is letters and "2014" is numbers, there's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider typos, the OCR output doesn't have any letters that match "DA". The numbers 2, 0, 1, 4 don't relate to the letters D or A. 

The categories are: 
1. Correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
2. Slightly correct if at least one but not all match.
3. Incorrect if none match or the output is unrelated.

In this case, the OCR output has none of the words from the ground truth. So it should be category 3. The output is unrelated (numbers vs. letters) and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "2014" could be a typo for "DA" since they are different types of characters. Therefore, the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 66
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 152
