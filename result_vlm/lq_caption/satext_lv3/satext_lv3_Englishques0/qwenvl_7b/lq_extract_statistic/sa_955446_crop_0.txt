gt_text: EC
vlm_output: SCANAK

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EC", and the VLM OCR output is "SCANAK". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SCANAK". So that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The categories are:
1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words are present in OCR output.
2 — Partially correct: At least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: No matches, or output is unrelated/empty.

So, the ground truth is "EC". Let's break that down. The unique words here are "EC". The OCR output is "SCANAK". Now, I need to check if "SCANAK" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth, considering the rules.

First, ignore case. Both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. Now, check if "SCANAK" contains "EC" as a substring or as a word. But "SCANAK" is a single word. The ground truth is "EC", which is two letters. However, the OCR output is "SCANAK" which is six letters. 

But the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EC". The OCR output's unique words are "SCANAK". So, are there any matches? 

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has {"EC"}, and the OCR output has {"SCANAK"}. Since "SCANAK" doesn't contain "EC" as a substring or as a word, even with typos allowed? Wait, the note says small typos still count as matches. But "SCANAK" isn't a typo of "EC". It's a completely different word. 

So, "EC" is two letters, and "SCANAK" is six letters. There's no overlap. Therefore, there are no matching words. So according to category 3: Incorrect, because no words match. 

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Is the OCR output supposed to be split into words? For example, if the OCR output was "SCAN AK", maybe "AK" could be considered. But the OCR output here is "SCANAK" as a single word. The ground truth is "EC" as a single word. So unless "SCANAK" contains "EC" as a substring, which it doesn't, there's no match. 

Therefore, the answer would be category 3 because there are no matching words. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, even with typos considered. Since "SCANAK" is not a typo of "EC", but a completely different word, there's no match. Hence, category 3.
