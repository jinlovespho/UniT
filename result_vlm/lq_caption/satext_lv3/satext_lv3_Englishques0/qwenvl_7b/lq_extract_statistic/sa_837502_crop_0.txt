gt_text: LV
vlm_output: LV

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LV" and the VLM OCR output is also "LV". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "LV", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "LV".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "LV". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LV". The OCR output also has "LV". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and no spaces. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
