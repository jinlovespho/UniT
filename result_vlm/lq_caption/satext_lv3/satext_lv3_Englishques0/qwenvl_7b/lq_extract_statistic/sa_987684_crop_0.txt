gt_text: Civic
vlm_output: EXIT 10

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Civic", and the VLM OCR output is "EXIT 10". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "EXIT 10". So the words are "EXIT" and "10".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "Civic". The unique words in the ground truth are just "Civic". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So I need to check if any of the words from the OCR output match "Civic", considering case, typos, etc.

Looking at "EXIT" and "10" from the OCR output. "Civic" is a single word, and the OCR output has two words. Let's check each word in the OCR output against the ground truth word. 

"EXIT" vs "Civic": They are different. "10" is a number, which doesn't match "Civic" either. Even if we ignore case, "exit" still doesn't match "Civic". Also, there are no typos here; the OCR output words are just not related to "Civic".

The criteria mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—just a complete mismatch. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "Civic" in any form. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain the ground truth word. So the answer should be 3.
