gt_text: BRAZZERS
vlm_output: BRAZZERS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BRAZZERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "BRAZZERS". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "BRAZZERS". The OCR output also has "BRAZZERS". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no punctuation or spaces. The note says small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same word, it meets category 1. There's no partial match or no match here. So the answer should be 1.
