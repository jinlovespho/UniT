gt_text: RYANAIR
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "RYANAIR" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percent sign. The ground truth is the word "RYANAIR", which is a proper noun, the name of an airline. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RYANAIR". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a numeral with a percentage symbol. The ground truth is a word. So, there's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "RYANAIR". They are entirely different. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 
2 if at least one but not all match. 
3 if none match or output is wrong/unrelated/empty.

In this case, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. "RYANAIR" isn't in "100%", and "100%" isn't a variation of "RYANAIR". So, no matches. Therefore, it should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
