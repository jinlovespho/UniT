gt_text: NE
vlm_output: NE 3BRAZILIA

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NE" and the VLM OCR output is "NE 3BRAZILIA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NE 3BRAZILIA". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "NE". The OCR output also has "NE" as the first part. Then there's "3BRAZILIA". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NE" (since it's only one word). The OCR output has "NE" and "3BRAZILIA". 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has "NE", which is present in the OCR output. The other part of the OCR output, "3BRAZILIA", isn't part of the ground truth. But the rules say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we only check if "NE" is present. Since it is, that's all that's needed for category 1. 

Also, the rules mention that typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo in "NE" compared to the ground truth. The "3BRAZILIA" part is extra, but since we're only checking the presence of the ground truth words, that's okay. 

So the answer should be category 1 because all unique words from the ground truth ("NE") are present in the OCR output.
