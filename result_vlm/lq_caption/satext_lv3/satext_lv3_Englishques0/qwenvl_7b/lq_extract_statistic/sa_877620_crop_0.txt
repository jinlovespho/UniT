gt_text: ZONE
vlm_output: NO FLY ZONE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZONE" and the VLM OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NO FLY ZONE". So the extracted text is just that phrase.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has the unique words "ZONE". The OCR output has "NO", "FLY", and "ZONE". 

So, looking at the unique words in the ground truth, which is just "ZONE". The OCR output includes "ZONE" as one of its words. The other words in the OCR output, "NO" and "FLY", aren't part of the ground truth. But the key here is that the ground truth's unique words must be present in the OCR output. Since "ZONE" is present, even though there are extra words, it still counts. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The capitalization and spacing are ignored. The OCR output has "ZONE" which matches the ground truth exactly. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "ZONE" is present, even with extra words, it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
