gt_text: KD
vlm_output: KD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KD" and the VLM OCR output is also "KD". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "KD", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Both texts here are just two letters, so order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "KD" (assuming it's considered a single word here). The OCR output is the same, so the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are "KD" with no punctuation or spaces, there's nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, this fits Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as 2 or 3. The output is exactly correct according to all given criteria. So the answer should be 1.
