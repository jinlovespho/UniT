gt_text: Rio
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Rio" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is the word "Rio", which is a proper noun, likely referring to the city in Brazil.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rio". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, checking if there's any match. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "Rio" or any variation of it. The word "Rio" is a proper noun, and "10%" is a numerical value. There's no overlap in the words here. Also, considering that typos are counted as matches, but in this case, there's no typo of "Rio" in the OCR output. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of characters and meaning.

So, according to the categories:
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Rio" isn't in "10%", this isn't the case.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But there are no matches here, so this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "10%" has no relation to "Rio" and no words match, this fits.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
