gt_text: Kinder
vlm_output: Kinder

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Kinder" and the VLM OCR output is also "Kinder". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Kinder".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Kinder". The OCR output has the same word. Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, that should be category 1. The answer should be 1.
