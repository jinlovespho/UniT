gt_text: TD
vlm_output: TD

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "TD" and the VLM OCR output is also "TD". The task is to compare them based on specific criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "TD", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are just two letters. The unique words in the ground truth are "TD". The OCR output also has "TD". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has exactly the same unique words (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), even though there's no difference here, it still matches. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "TD") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words or extra words. The answer should be category 1.
