gt_text: km/h
vlm_output: 0 km/h

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "km/h" and the VLM OCR output is "0 km/h". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "0 km/h". So the extracted text is "0 km/h".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "km/h". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "km/h".

Now, I need to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output has "0" and "km/h". The "km/h" is present, which is the only unique word in the ground truth. The "0" is an extra number, but the problem states that extra words are allowed as long as all the ground truth words are present. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has "km/h" exactly as in the ground truth, just with an additional "0".

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 
2 if at least one but not all, 
3 if none or unrelated.

Since the OCR output includes "km/h" (the only unique word from the ground truth), even though there's an extra "0", it still meets category 1. The presence of an extra word doesn't disqualify it because the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces and consider only the set of unique words from the ground truth. The "0" isn't part of the ground truth, but since the ground truth's words are all present, it's correct.
