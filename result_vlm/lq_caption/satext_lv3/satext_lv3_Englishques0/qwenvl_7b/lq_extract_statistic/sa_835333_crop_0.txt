gt_text: RIKSTELEFON
vlm_output: Hasselberg

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "RIKSTELEFON" and the OCR output is "Hasselberg". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "Hasselberg". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The ground truth has one word: "RIKSTELEFON". The OCR output has "Hasselberg". 

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "RIKSTELEFON". The OCR output's unique word is "Hasselberg". I need to check if there's any match. The rules mention that small typos count as matches, but I don't see any typos here. "Hasselberg" and "RIKSTELEFON" are completely different words. No letters in common, so even considering typos, they don't match. 

So, the OCR output has none of the ground truth words. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
