gt_text: in

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "in", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are important. The comparison should ignore word order, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are just "in", so order isn't an issue here.

Next, the comparison is based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". So the unique words match exactly.

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and there's no punctuation or spaces, this doesn't affect the comparison.

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR has that same word, this fits Category 1. 

There's no possibility of Category 2 or 3 here because there's a full match. Even if there were typos, like "inn" or "in.", it would still be considered a match due to the small typo rule. But in this case, it's exact. 

So the answer should be Category 1.
