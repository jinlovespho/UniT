gt_text: BiZ

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BiZ" and the VLM OCR output is also "BiZ". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BiZ".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has one word: "BiZ". The OCR output is the same word. Let's check the conditions. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, even if there were minor differences like case or typos, but here it's exactly the same. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "BiZ") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output, this should be category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The output is correct. No typos, same word. So the answer is 1.
