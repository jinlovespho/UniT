Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "21" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps given to determine the category.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". So the extracted text is "100%".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "21". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

So, the ground truth has the words "21". Wait, but "21" is a number. The OCR output is "100%". Let's break it down.

First, unique words in ground truth: "21" is one unique word. The OCR output has "100%", which is a different number. But maybe I need to check if there's any overlap. However, "100%" and "21" are different numbers. There's no word in the OCR output that matches "21" even with typos. Let me think: "100%" has digits 1, 0, 0, but the ground truth is 2 and 1. So the numbers are different. Even if we consider typos, like maybe OCR mistook '2' as '100%'? That doesn't seem right. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage, not a number like 21. 

So, the unique word in ground truth is "21". The OCR output has "100%", which doesn't contain "21" as a substring or in any form. Even if we ignore punctuation, "100%" becomes "100" which is still not "21". So there's no match. 

Therefore, according to the categories: category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since there's no match here, it should be category 3.
