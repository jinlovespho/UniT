gt_text: APPROACH
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APPROACH" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "APPROACH". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "APPROACH". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "APPROACH" isn't present in "100%". There's no overlap in the words. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but "100%" doesn't have any words related to "APPROACH". Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "APPROACH". 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words from the ground truth.
