gt_text: M
vlm_output: M

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "M" and the VLM OCR output is also "M". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is just "M", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both are single letters, so order isn't an issue here.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "M". The OCR output also has "M". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are just "M", there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "M" which matches the ground truth's "M", this meets Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
