gt_text: ALSTOM
vlm_output: ALSTOM

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "ALSTOM" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALSTOM". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ALSTOM".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ALSTOM". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a match. So this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer is 1.
