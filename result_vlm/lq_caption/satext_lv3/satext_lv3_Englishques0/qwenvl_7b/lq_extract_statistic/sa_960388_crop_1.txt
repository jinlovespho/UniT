gt_text: EVA
vlm_output: HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EVA" and the VLM OCR output is "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "HOTEL". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The ground truth has the unique word "EVA". The OCR output has "HOTEL". 

Now, checking if there's any match. The unique words in ground truth are just "EVA". The OCR output has "HOTEL". Are there any overlaps? "EVA" and "HOTEL" don't share any common letters, so there's no match. 

Considering the categories: since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, even with ignoring case, spacing, etc., it falls under category 3—Incorrect. Even if there were typos, like if OCR had "EVA" with some typos, it would still count. But here, the words are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
