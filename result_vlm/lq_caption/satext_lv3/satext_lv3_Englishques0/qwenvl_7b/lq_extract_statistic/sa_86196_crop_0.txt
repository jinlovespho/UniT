gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: CROWN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CROWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "CROWN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "CROWN", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CROWN". The OCR output also has "CROWN". 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and no spaces. So they match exactly in those aspects. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and everything matches when considering the allowed variations.
