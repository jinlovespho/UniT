gt_text: DIDZIOJI
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DIDZIOJI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "DIDZIOJI", which looks like a Lithuanian word, possibly a name or a term.

Next, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DIDZIOJI". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "DIDZIOJI" is a word, and "100%" is a number. There's no overlap here. Even if we ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., "100%" doesn't contain any letters that match "DIDZIOJI". 

Also, small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no attempt to spell "DIDZIOJI" at all. The OCR output is entirely different. 

So, according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect.
