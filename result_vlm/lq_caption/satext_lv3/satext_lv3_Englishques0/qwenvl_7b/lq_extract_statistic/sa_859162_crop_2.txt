gt_text: HEYKERS
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HEYKERS" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is a number. The ground truth is "HEYKERS", which is a word, possibly a name or a term. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth is a single word, "HEYKERS". The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, considering the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word, "HEYKERS". The OCR output is "100", which doesn't contain that word. So there's no match here. 

Category 2 is for partially correct, where at least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth and it's not present in the OCR output, this doesn't apply either. 

Category 3 is for incorrect, which includes cases where no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100" is a number and doesn't match "HEYKERS" in any way, even considering typos, capitalization, etc., it's clearly unrelated. 

Therefore, the correct category should be 3.
