gt_text: APLI
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APLI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". So the extracted text is just that string. 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering the specified factors. The ground truth is "APLI", which is four letters. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage symbol and numbers. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. But since both the ground truth and the OCR output are single words (or in this case, a single string), order might not be an issue here. However, the key point is to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The ground truth has the word "APLI". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different set of characters. Now, the instructions mention that we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "APLI". 

Now, the OCR output doesn't have "APLI" in it. The OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. Even if we consider possible typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "APLI" in any way. There's no overlap in characters or words. 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no similarity between "APLI" and "100%". The OCR output is entirely different. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words ("APLI") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth. 

I should also check if there's any possibility that "100%" could be a typo for "APLI". But "100%" is a numerical percentage, and "APLI" is a four-letter acronym. There's no obvious typo or substitution here. So, no match. 

Therefore, the correct category is 3.
