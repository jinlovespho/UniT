gt_text: Tea
vlm_output: 5

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Tea" and the VLM OCR output is "5". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "5", which is a number.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Tea". The OCR output is "5", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But "5" isn't a word, and "Tea" isn't in the OCR output. So that's not matching. Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But there are no words in the OCR output that match "Tea". The OCR output is a number, so no words here. So maybe it's category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Wait, the OCR output is "5", which is unrelated to "Tea". So according to the categories, since there's no matching words, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
