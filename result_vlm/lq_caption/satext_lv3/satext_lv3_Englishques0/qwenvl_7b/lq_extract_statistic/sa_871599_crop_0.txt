Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "42" and the VLM OCR output is also "42". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "42", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are just the number 42. Since there's only one "word" here, which is "42", and it's the same in both, the order isn't an issue.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "42". The OCR output also has "42". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, there's no capitalization or punctuation, and no spaces. So nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "42" is present in the OCR output, the answer should be 1.
