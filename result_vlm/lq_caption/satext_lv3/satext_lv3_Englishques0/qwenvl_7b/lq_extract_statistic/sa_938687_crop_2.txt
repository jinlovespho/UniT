Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single characters, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, which is "1". The OCR output also has "1". 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since there are no capitals, punctuation, or spaces here, that's not a factor. Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because both are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output", this should be category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or incorrect stuff. The answer should be 1.
