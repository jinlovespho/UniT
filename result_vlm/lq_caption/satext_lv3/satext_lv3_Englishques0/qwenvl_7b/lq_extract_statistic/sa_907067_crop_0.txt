gt_text: ELEANOR
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ELEANOR" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%". So the extracted text is just "10%".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ELEANOR". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ELEANOR".

Now, the OCR output is "10%". Let's check if there's any match. The OCR output has "10%" which is a number and a percentage symbol. The ground truth is a name, "ELEANOR". 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "10%" is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a proper noun. The OCR output doesn't have the word "ELEANOR" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "ELEANOR" in any way. 

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, according to category 3, which states "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." The OCR output here is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth. Therefore, the correct category should be 3.
