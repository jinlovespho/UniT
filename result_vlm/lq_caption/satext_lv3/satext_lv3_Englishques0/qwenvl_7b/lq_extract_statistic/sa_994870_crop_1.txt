Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "52" and the VLM OCR output is also "52". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "52", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "52".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "52". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "52" since it's a single number. The OCR output is exactly the same: "52". 

So comparing the sets of unique words: the ground truth has {"52"} and the OCR output also has {"52"}. All unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There are no typos, no extra spaces, and the order doesn't matter here since there's only one word. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since they do, this should be category 1. There's no case or punctuation to consider here, and the output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
