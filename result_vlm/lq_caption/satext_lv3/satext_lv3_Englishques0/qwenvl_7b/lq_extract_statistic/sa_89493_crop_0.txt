Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "demande". The OCR output is "ICIdemande de permis de construireE.LeclercDRIVE".

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has "ICIdemande de permis de construireE.LeclercDRIVE". Let me parse that. It seems like there's some noise at the beginning and end. The main words might be "demande", "de", "permis", "construire", "E.Leclerc", "DRIVE". But I need to consider that OCR can have errors, like "ICIdemande" might be "demande" with some prefix, and "construireE.LeclercDRIVE" could be "construire" followed by other names or terms.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "demande". The unique words in the ground truth are only "demande". The OCR output has "demande" in it, right? Let me check. The OCR output starts with "ICIdemande", which is "ICIdemande". If we ignore capitalization, spacing, and typos, then "ICIdemande" would be considered as "demande" since the extra letters might be typos or OCR errors. Also, the rest of the OCR output includes "de", "permis", "construire", etc., but the ground truth only has "demande". 

So according to the criteria: the set of unique words in the ground truth is {"demande"}. The OCR output must contain all of these words. Since "demande" is present in the OCR output (even if there are typos around it), then it's a correct match. The other words in the OCR output don't matter because the ground truth only has "demande". 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "demande"), then it's category 1. Even if there are other words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's correct. So even if the OCR output has extra words, as long as "demande" is there, it's correct. 

So the answer should be category 1.
