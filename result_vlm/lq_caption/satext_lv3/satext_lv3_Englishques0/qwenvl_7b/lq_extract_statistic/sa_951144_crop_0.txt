gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "LIBERTE". First, I need to follow the steps outlined.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "LIBERTE", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LIBERTE". The OCR output also has "LIBERTE". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. Punctuation and spaces—there's none here. Typos? The OCR output matches exactly, so no typos. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. There's no partial match here because all required words are there. So the answer should be 1.
