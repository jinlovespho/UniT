gt_text: ADVENTURE
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ADVENTURE" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "ADVENTURE". 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ADVENTURE". The OCR output is "1970", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 
2 if at least one but not all match. 
3 if none match or output is wrong/unrelated.

So, the OCR output is "1970", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "ADVENTURE". Since the OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth, even considering typos or case, there's no match. The number 1970 isn't a typo of "ADVENTURE" or any part of it. They are completely unrelated. So according to category 3, which is for no matches or unrelated outputs, this should be category 3.
