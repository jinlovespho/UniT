gt_text: AH
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AH" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "AH", which is one word. But wait, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the ground truth is "AH" which is two letters, and the OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. The unique words in the ground truth are just "AH". The OCR output's text is "100%", which doesn't contain "AH" in any form. Even if I ignore case and punctuation, "100%" doesn't have the letters A and H. 

Also, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output is entirely different. So the unique word from the ground truth isn't present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
