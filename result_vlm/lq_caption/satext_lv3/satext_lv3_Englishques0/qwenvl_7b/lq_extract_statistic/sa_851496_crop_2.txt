Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Jeep" and the VLM OCR output is also "Jeep". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Jeep".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Jeep". The OCR output is the same word. Even though there's no difference, the criteria say that if all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), it's category 1. Since both are exactly the same, it definitely meets the criteria. There's no missing words, no typos, and the only word matches. So the answer should be category 1.
