gt_text: BEER

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEER" and the VLM OCR output is also "BEER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "BEER".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are just one word. So the order isn't an issue here.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BEER". The OCR output also has "BEER". So the unique words match exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and no punctuation or spaces. So that's the same.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same unique word, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output is exactly correct according to the criteria given.
