Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is just "1", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "1".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word, which is "1". The OCR output also has "1". Since they are exactly the same, even though there's only one word, it's a perfect match. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. There's no mention of any typos here, so even if there were small typos, the instruction says they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. 

No other words are involved, so it's not partially correct or incorrect. So the answer should be 1.
