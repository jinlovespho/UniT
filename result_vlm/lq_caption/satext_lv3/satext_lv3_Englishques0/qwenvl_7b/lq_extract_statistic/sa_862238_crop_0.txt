gt_text: KLM
vlm_output: KLM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KLM" and the VLM OCR output is also "KLM". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are just three letters, there's no order to consider here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "KLM". The OCR output also has "KLM". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces aren't present here either. There's no typo mentioned because they are identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since they match exactly, even though the steps mention considering typos, but in this case, there are none. So the answer should be 1.
