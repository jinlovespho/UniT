gt_text: ARNOLD
vlm_output: ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARNOLD". The VLM OCR output is "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That would be "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR".

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ARNOLD". The OCR output has two words: "ARNOLD" and "HUNTERSCULPTOR".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth's unique words are just {"ARNOLD"}.

Now, checking if "ARNOLD" is present in the OCR output. Yes, it's there as the first word. The other word, "HUNTERSCULPTOR", isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we only need to check the ground truth words. 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, case is ignored (though both are uppercase here), and typos are allowed. Since "ARNOLD" is exactly present, even with the extra word, it's still a match. 

So, all unique ground truth words (just "ARNOLD") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it should be category 1.
