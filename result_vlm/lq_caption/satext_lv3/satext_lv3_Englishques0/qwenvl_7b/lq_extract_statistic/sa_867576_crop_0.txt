gt_text: WDR
vlm_output: WDR

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "WDR" and the VLM OCR output is also "WDR". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "WDR", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same. 

They also say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "WDR". The OCR output also has "WDR". 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing—though in this case, there's no punctuation or extra spaces. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "WDR") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and no typos. The answer is 1.
