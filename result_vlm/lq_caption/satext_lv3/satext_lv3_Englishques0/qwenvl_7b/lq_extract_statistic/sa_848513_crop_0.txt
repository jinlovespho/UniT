gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CODE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "CODE", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "CODE". The OCR output has "100%", which is not "CODE". 

So, considering that, there's no match between the OCR output and the ground truth words. The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "100%" doesn't contain "CODE" or any of its variations (like considering typos, but "100%" isn't a typo of "CODE"), there's no match. Therefore, it should be category 3.

2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 79
