gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Bank", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. 

Next, they mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bank". The OCR output also has "Bank". 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation here either. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly "Bank".

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
