gt_text: SHACK
vlm_output: SHACK

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SHACK" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHACK". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria provided.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. Since the OCR output is "SHACK", that's straightforward. Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "SHACK" is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Now, considering the comparison rules. Since both are exactly the same word, even though the problem mentions ignoring case, but here both are uppercase, so case is the same. There are no typos, so that's a perfect match. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SHACK", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth and the OCR output has it exactly, this should be category 1. I don't see any issues here. The output is correct, so the answer is 1.
