gt_text: DiGi
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DiGi" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, the ground truth is "DiGi". Let's break down the comparison criteria:

1. **Word order doesn't matter**: So, we don't have to check the sequence of words.
2. **Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth**: The ground truth has one word, "DiGi".
3. **Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces**: So, "DiGi" could be compared as "dig", "DIGI", etc., but since the OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a percentage sign, there's no letters here.
4. **Small typos still count as matches**: But in this case, there are no letters in the OCR output, so typos aren't applicable here.

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "DiGi". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. There's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we consider ignoring case and punctuation, "100%" doesn't contain any letters, so it can't match "DiGi" which is a word with letters. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present.
- Category 2 requires at least one but not all.
- Category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated.

Since there's no match, the correct category is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 201
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 474
