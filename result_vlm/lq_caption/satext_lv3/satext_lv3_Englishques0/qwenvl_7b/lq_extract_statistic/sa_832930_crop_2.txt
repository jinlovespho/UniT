gt_text: Victoria
vlm_output: Victoria Station

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria" and the VLM OCR output is "Victoria Station". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Victoria Station", so the words are "Victoria" and "Station".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Victoria". The OCR output has two words: "Victoria" and "Station". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth's unique words are {"Victoria"}. The OCR output's words are {"Victoria", "Station"}.

Now, check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Victoria" is present in the OCR output, that's a match. The other word in the OCR output, "Station", isn't in the ground truth, but the rules say we only need to check if all ground truth words are present. 

The category is determined by whether all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Since "Victoria" is there, even though there's an extra word, it's still a correct match. The rules mention that extra words are ignored as long as all required words are present. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, the category should be 1 — Correct.
