gt_text: TELEPHONE
vlm_output: TELEPHONE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TELEPHONE" and the VLM OCR output is also "TELEPHONE". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth.

The comparison criteria mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "TELEPHONE". The OCR output has the same word. Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't present here. There are no typos either. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1 — correct. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
