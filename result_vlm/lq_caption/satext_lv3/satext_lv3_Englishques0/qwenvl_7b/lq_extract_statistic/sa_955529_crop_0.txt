gt_text: verbal
vlm_output: verbal

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "verbal" and the VLM OCR output is also "verbal". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "verbal".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Then, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "verbal". The OCR output also has "verbal". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and single word. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are exactly the same.

So all unique ground truth words (which is just "verbal") are present in the OCR output. That means it's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
