gt_text: SAGA
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "SAGA" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "SAGA", which is a word. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "SAGA", which is one word. The OCR output is "1970", which is four numbers. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, considering case, spacing, typos, etc. But here, the OCR output has numbers, not letters. The ground truth is the word "SAGA". So, the OCR output doesn't have any letters, only digits. 

Since there's no overlap in characters between "SAGA" and "1970", even if we consider typos or case, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the letters from the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SAGA", and the OCR output doesn't have that. 

Therefore, the category would be 3 because no words match. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Even if we ignore case or spacing, there's no match here. So the answer should be 3.
