gt_text: GRAND
vlm_output: The text in the image is not clear enough to be accurately transcribed.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "GRAND", and the VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image is not clear enough to be accurately transcribed." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement about the text not being clear. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "GRAND". The OCR output doesn't have the word "grand" or any variation of it. The OCR output is explaining that the text isn't clear, so it's not providing the actual text. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth has only one unique word: "GRAND". The OCR output has words like "The", "text", "image", "not", "clear", "enough", "to", "be", "accurately", "transcribed". None of these are "GRAND" or any form of it. 

Even if we ignore capitalization, "grand" isn't there. The OCR output is not providing the actual text, so there's no match. According to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text, as it's explaining the failure to transcribe rather than providing the transcription.
