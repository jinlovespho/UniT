gt_text: Card
vlm_output: Card only

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Card" and the VLM OCR output is "Card only". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Card only". Then, compare it with the ground truth, which is "Card".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I don't have to worry about the sequence of words. Next, I should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Card". 

Now, the OCR output has two words: "Card" and "only". The comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. So I check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The word "Card" is present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "only", isn't part of the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking if the ground truth words are in the OCR output. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are lowercase, so no issue there. There's no typos in "Card" in the OCR output. The word "only" is extra, but since the ground truth only has "Card", and that's present, it meets the criteria for category 1. 

So the answer should be category 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
