gt_text: MAN
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MAN" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is the word "MAN". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MAN".

Now, I need to check if the OCR output contains any of these words, considering case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. There's no mention of the word "MAN" here. The words in the OCR output are "100" and "%" (but percentage is a symbol, not a word). 

Since the ground truth is "MAN" and the OCR output is "100%", there's no overlap in the words. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "MAN" or any of its variations. Even if there were typos, like "Man" or "mAn", but here it's "100%", which is entirely different. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's no match, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but here none do. So it's category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the required word.
