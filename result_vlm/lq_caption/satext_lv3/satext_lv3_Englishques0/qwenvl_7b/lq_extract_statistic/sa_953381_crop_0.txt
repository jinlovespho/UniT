gt_text: Uber
vlm_output: Uber

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "Uber" and the VLM OCR output is also "Uber". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Uber", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, they are the same. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Uber". The OCR output also has "Uber". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since both are exactly "Uber" with no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Therefore, all conditions for category 1 are met. The OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth, and they match exactly. So the answer should be category 1.
