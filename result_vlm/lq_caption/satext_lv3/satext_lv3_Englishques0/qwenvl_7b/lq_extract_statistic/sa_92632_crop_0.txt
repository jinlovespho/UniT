gt_text: SQUARE
vlm_output: Coca-Cola

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SQUARE" and the VLM OCR output is "Coca-Cola". So I need to compare these two according to the steps given.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Coca-Cola", so that's straightforward. Then step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth, considering the given factors.

The ground truth has the word "SQUARE", which is one unique word. The OCR output has "Coca-Cola", which is another word. Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are just {"SQUARE"}.

Next, we need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output is "Coca-Cola". Let's see if "SQUARE" is present here. But "Coca-Cola" doesn't have "SQUARE" in it. Even if we ignore case, it's still not there. Also, there's no mention of typos here, but since the OCR output is entirely different, there's no match.

So the unique words in the OCR output are {"Coca-Cola"}, which doesn't include "SQUARE". Therefore, none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
