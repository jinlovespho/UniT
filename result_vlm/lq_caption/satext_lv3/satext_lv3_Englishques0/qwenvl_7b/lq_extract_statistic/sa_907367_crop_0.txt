gt_text: Saturday
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Saturday" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Saturday". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, typos. Also, small typos still count as matches. But the OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage, not a word. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Saturday". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percent sign. So there's no overlap in words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "Saturday" in any way. The category is determined by whether any of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Saturday" isn't in "100%", and there are no other words in the ground truth, it's category 3. 

Wait, but maybe the OCR output is a percentage indicating confidence? But the problem says to compare the text content. So "100%" is just text. The ground truth is "Saturday". No words match. So category 3: Incorrect.
