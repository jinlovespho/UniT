Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "60" and the VLM OCR output is also "60". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "60".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. Then, we need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "60".

Now, check if the OCR output has all those unique words. The OCR output is exactly "60", so it matches. The other considerations like capitalization, punctuation, and spacing don't apply here because there's no variation. Also, there are no typos since both are the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
