gt_text: Gategourmet
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Gategourmet" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "Gategourmet". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the ground truth is a single word, "Gategourmet", which isn't a standard word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth (even considering typos or variations), there's no match. The ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has none of that. So according to the categories, this would be category 3 because there are no matches and the output is unrelated. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if "100%" could be a typo for "Gategourmet"? But "100%" is a number, and "Gategourmet" is a combination of "Gate" and "gourmet". There's no overlap in letters or possible typos here. So no, they don't match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
