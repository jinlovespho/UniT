gt_text: AMSTEL
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMSTEL" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, moving to Step 2, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. 

The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down. The word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check if the words are in the same sequence. Then, it says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "AMSTEL", which is a single word. So the unique words here are just "AMSTEL".

Next, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. The OCR output is "100%", which has a percentage sign. But the ground truth doesn't have any punctuation. However, since we're comparing words, the punctuation might be a problem. Wait, but the OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage. The ground truth is a proper noun, "AMSTEL", which is a place. 

Now, the rules say that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output isn't even a word that's similar to "AMSTEL". "100%" is a number, not a word. So there's no overlap in terms of words. The ground truth has "AMSTEL" and the OCR output has "100%", which are entirely different. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "AMSTEL" is a single unique word and the OCR output doesn't contain any of that word (it's a number), there's no match. Therefore, this should be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible way the OCR could have a typo that's close. But "100%" is a number, not a word. "AMSTEL" is a proper noun. There's no way "100%" can be considered a typo of "AMSTEL" even with the typo rule. So the answer is 3.
