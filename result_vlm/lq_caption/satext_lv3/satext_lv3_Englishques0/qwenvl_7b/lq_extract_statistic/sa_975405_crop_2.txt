gt_text: OPTIC

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OPTIC" and the VLM OCR output is "102". The task is to compare these based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "102", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "OPTIC". 

Now, step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth has one word, "OPTIC", and the OCR output has "102", which are numbers. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OPTIC". The OCR output doesn't have any words, only numbers. 

The instructions mention to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth to be category 1. Since the OCR output has no words, it can't contain "OPTIC". 

Also, the categories say that category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated or empty. The OCR output here is "102", which is numbers, not the word "OPTIC". So there's no match. Therefore, it should be category 3. 

Even if I consider typos, but "102" isn't a typo of "OPTIC". The letters and numbers are different. So no match. Hence, category 3.
