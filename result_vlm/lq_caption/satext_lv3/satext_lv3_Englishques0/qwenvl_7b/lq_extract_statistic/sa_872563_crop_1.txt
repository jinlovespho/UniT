Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OX" and the VLM OCR output is also "OX". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "OX", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "OX".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "OX" (assuming it's one word). Wait, but "OX" is a single word, right? So the unique words in ground truth are just {"OX"}.

Now, the OCR output is also "OX", so the unique words there are also {"OX"}. So comparing the sets, they are exactly the same. The other considerations: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces—there are none here. Typos are considered as matches if small. But there are no typos here since they are the same.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both have the same set, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
