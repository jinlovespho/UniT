Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "€9.00" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps given to determine the category.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward.

Next, step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has "€9.00". Let's break this down. The unique words here are "€9.00". But wait, is "€9.00" considered a single word or multiple? Since it's a currency value with a symbol, maybe it's treated as one word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: the OCR output has "100%", which doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "€9.00", and the OCR output has "100%". There's no overlap here. Even if we ignore punctuation, "100%" becomes "100" and "€9.00" becomes "9.00" if we remove the symbol. But "100" and "9.00" are different numbers. So there's no matching word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there's no match, the category should be 3.
