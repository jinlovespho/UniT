gt_text: mL
vlm_output: 120mL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "mL" and the VLM OCR output is "120mL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "120mL". So, the extracted text is "120mL".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "mL". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has the words "mL", which is one unique word. The OCR output has "120mL". 

Now, I need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "mL". The OCR output has "120mL". If I ignore numbers, the "mL" part is present. But wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "mL" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. However, the presence of the number "120" might be a problem. But the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but here the OCR output has an extra number. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "mL" is present in the OCR output, even though there's a number in front, maybe that's considered a match. Wait, but the OCR output is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. So the unique word from the ground truth is "mL", and that is present in the OCR output. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. 

But wait, the ground truth is just "mL", and the OCR output is "120mL". The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "mL". The OCR output has two parts: "120" and "mL". But the OCR output is considered as a single text, so perhaps the words are split by spaces? Wait, the original text is "120mL" which is a single token, not separated by spaces. The instructions mention to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe "120mL" is considered as one word. But the ground truth is "mL", which is a different word. However, the OCR output includes "mL" as part of the text. But is "mL" a separate word in the OCR output? If the OCR output is "120mL", then it's a single word, but the "mL" is part of that word. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "mL", which is a single word. The OCR output has "120mL", which is a different word. But maybe the "mL" is present as a substring. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words, not substrings. So if the OCR output is "120mL", does that contain the word "mL"? If the OCR output is considered as a single word, then "mL" is not a separate word. But maybe the OCR output is split into tokens. Wait, the problem says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output". So if the OCR output is "120mL", then the text is "120mL". The ground truth is "mL". So the OCR output includes the "mL" part. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "mL" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "120mL" as a single word. But does that count as containing "mL"? If the OCR output's text is "120mL", and the ground truth is "mL", then perhaps the OCR output includes "mL" as part of the text. However, the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output is a single word. The question is whether "mL" is considered a match if it's part of a longer string. The instructions don't specify that, but they do say to ignore extra/missing spaces. For example, if the OCR output was "mL" with extra spaces, that's okay. But in this case, the OCR output is "120mL", which includes "mL" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output's text is "120mL", and the ground truth is "mL", then the OCR output's text includes "mL" as a substring. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output's text is a single word "120mL", then the unique words in the OCR output are just that one word. The ground truth's unique words are "mL". So the OCR output's unique words don't include "mL" as a separate word. Therefore, there's no match. Wait, but the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "mL" as a unique word. The OCR output has "120mL" as a unique word. Are these considered as matching? The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But "120mL" is not a typo of "mL", it's a different word with an extra number. So in this case, the OCR output does not contain the exact word "mL" from the ground truth. Therefore, the answer would be category 3, incorrect, because no words match. Wait, but the OCR output has "mL" as part of the text. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output's text is "120mL", then the unique words in the OCR output are ["120mL"], and the ground truth's unique words are ["mL"]. Since "120mL" is not the same as "mL", even though it contains "mL" as a substring, the unique words don't match. Therefore, category 3. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. If the OCR output is "120mL", then perhaps the system is supposed to recognize that "mL" is present, even though there's a number in front. But according to the problem's instructions, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output is considered as a single word, then it's not matching. However, if the OCR output is split into "120" and "mL" as two separate words, then "mL" would be present. But the original text is "120mL", which is a single token. The problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but that's about spaces between words. So if the OCR output is "120mL", it's a single word. Therefore, the unique words in the OCR output are ["120mL"], which doesn't include "mL" as a separate word. Hence, no match. Therefore, category 3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as "120 mL" with a space, but it's written as "120mL". The problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "120mL", but the ground truth is "mL", maybe the "mL" is considered as part of the OCR output. However, the instructions don't mention substring matching, only word matching. Therefore, the answer would be category 3.
