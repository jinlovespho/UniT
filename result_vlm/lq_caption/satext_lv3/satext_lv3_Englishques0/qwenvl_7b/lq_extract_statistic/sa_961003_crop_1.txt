gt_text: REIMS
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "REIMS" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "100%". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "REIMS". The OCR output has "100%", which is a percentage. Now, looking at the categories:

- The first category (1) requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "REIMS" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word "REIMS". So there's no match here. 

- The second category (2) is for when at least one but not all unique words match. But since there are no matches at all, this doesn't apply.

- The third category (3) is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" isn't related to "REIMS" and there's no overlap in words, this fits category 3.

I should also consider the instructions about ignoring capitalization, spacing, etc., but since the OCR output has a number instead of the word, those factors don't help here. Typos aren't applicable because "100%" isn't a typo of "REIMS". Therefore, the answer is category 3.
