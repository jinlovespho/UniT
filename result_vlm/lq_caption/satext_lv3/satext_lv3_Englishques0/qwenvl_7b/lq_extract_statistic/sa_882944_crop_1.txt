Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPORTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "SPORTAGE", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "SPORTAGE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The ground truth has only one unique word: "SPORTAGE". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word), and considering that the words are the same (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), there are no typos here. So all unique words match.

Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. Because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words, no typos, and the only word is present. So the answer should be 1.
