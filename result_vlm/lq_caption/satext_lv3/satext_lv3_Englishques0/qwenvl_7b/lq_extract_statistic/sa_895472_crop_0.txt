gt_text: OVO
vlm_output: OVO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OVO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OVO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OVO".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "OVO" which is a single word. The OCR output is also "OVO". So the unique words in ground truth are just {"OVO"}.

Comparing the OCR output's words (which is also {"OVO"}) with the ground truth's set. Since they are the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though there's no difference, the rules say that if all unique words match, it's category 1.

So the answer should be 1.
