Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1947" and the VLM OCR output is also "1947". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "1947", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same number. Wait, but "1947" is a single number, not multiple words. The unique words in the ground truth would just be "1947" since it's one word. The OCR output also has "1947", so the set of unique words matches exactly.

The categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one unique word, and it's present, that's category 1. The other conditions like ignoring case, spacing, etc., don't apply here because there's no difference. Also, typos aren't an issue here since they are the same. So the answer should be 1.
