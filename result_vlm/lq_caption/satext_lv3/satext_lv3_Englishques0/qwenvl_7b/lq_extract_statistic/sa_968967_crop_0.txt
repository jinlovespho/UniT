gt_text: 8238888
vlm_output: SUNRISE TOWER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "8238888" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SUNRISE TOWER". Now, the ground truth is a string of numbers. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth here is "8238888", which is all numbers. So, does that mean the unique words in the ground truth are just the number "8238888"? Or are we considering each digit as a separate word? The problem statement says "unique words in the ground truth", but "8238888" is a single string without spaces. So, perhaps it's considered as one word.

But then, the OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER", which are two words. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the ground truth has no words in the traditional sense—it's a number. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The ground truth text is "8238888", which is a number. The OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER", which are two words. The categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. But the ground truth has no words, only numbers. So, according to the rules, if the ground truth has no words, then the OCR output would have to match those words. But since there are no words, maybe the category is 3—incorrect, because there are no matches. However, that seems odd.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check again. The user says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." If the ground truth is "8238888", which is a single number, then the unique words would be ["8238888"], assuming that the entire string is considered a single word. Then, the OCR output is "SUNRISE TOWER", which has two words. So, none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth's unique words. Therefore, category 3 would be the answer because there are no matches. 

But the user might have intended the ground truth to be words, but it's actually numbers. That's confusing. However, according to the given information, the ground truth is "8238888", so we have to go with that. Therefore, the OCR output has no matching words, so category 3 is correct.
