gt_text: PRATAS
vlm_output: CITY OF NEW YORKTRAVEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PRATAS" and the VLM OCR output is "CITY OF NEW YORKTRAVEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "CITY OF NEW YORKTRAVEL". Let me note that down.

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "PRATAS". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence of words. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "PRATAS". 

Now, I need to check if "PRATAS" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has the words: "CITY", "OF", "NEW", "YORKTRAVEL". Wait, "YORKTRAVEL" is one word here because there's no space between "YORK" and "TRAVEL". So the unique words in the OCR output are CITY, OF, NEW, YORKTRAVEL. 

Looking at these, none of them are "PRATAS". The ground truth word is "PRATAS", which isn't present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "YORKTRAVEL" which is a combination of "YORK" and "TRAVEL", but that's not related to "PRATAS". 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output doesn't have the word "PRATAS" at all. So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. 

Wait, but the ground truth is just one word. The OCR output has multiple words, but none match. So the answer should be category 3. Let me double-check. The ground truth's unique words are only "PRATAS", and the OCR output doesn't have that. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
