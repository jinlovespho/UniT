gt_text: VIP
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VIP" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "VIP", which is three letters. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "VIP". The OCR output has "100%", which is a different word. 

Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" has a percentage sign, which is punctuation. However, the ground truth doesn't have any punctuation. The OCR output's word is "100%", but the ground truth is "VIP". 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are entirely different. There's no overlap in the words. The ground truth's unique word is "VIP", and the OCR output has "100%", which is not a match. 

So according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated to the ground truth. There's no partial match here. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "VIP". So the answer should be 3.
