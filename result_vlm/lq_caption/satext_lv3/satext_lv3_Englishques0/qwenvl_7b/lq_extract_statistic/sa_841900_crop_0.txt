gt_text: San
vlm_output: San

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "San" and the VLM OCR output is also "San". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "San", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "San" is a single word. The OCR output is exactly the same. Since both are the same word, and considering that the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "San"), this should meet the criteria for Category 1. 

Wait, but the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. However, in this case, there's only one word, so order isn't an issue. Also, there are no typos here. The OCR output matches exactly. So all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, it's a correct match. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as partially correct or incorrect. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so Category 1 is the right choice.
