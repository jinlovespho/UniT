gt_text: Office
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Office" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth is "Office", which is one unique word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. Now, I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The word "Office" is not present in "100%". The OCR output doesn't have the word "Office" or any variation of it. Even if we consider possible typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "Office" in any way. The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since there's no overlap between the ground truth word and the OCR output, the answer should be category 3. The OCR output is entirely unrelated to the ground truth text.
