gt_text: Sinfulic
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Sinfulic" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to worry about that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "Sinfulic". 

Now, the OCR output is "100%". The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is a word, "Sinfulic", which is a noun, possibly a misspelling of "Sinful" or something else. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, and the ground truth is "Sinfulic", there's no overlap in words. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "Sinfulic". They are entirely different. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't match any of the ground truth words. So according to category 3, which is for no matches or unrelated outputs, the answer should be 3.
