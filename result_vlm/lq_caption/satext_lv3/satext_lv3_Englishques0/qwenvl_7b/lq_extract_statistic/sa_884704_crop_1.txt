gt_text: N3
vlm_output: WOW

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "N3" and the VLM OCR output is "WOW". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category number.

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "WOW". Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words are in OCR output.
2 — Partially correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no matches or output is wrong/unrelated/empty.

Now, the ground truth is "N3". Let's break that down. The unique words here are "N" and "3". Wait, but "N3" is a single token? Or is it two separate words? The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". So, if "N3" is considered as one word, then the set is {"N3"}. But if it's split into "N" and "3", then the set is {"N", "3"}.

But the OCR output is "WOW", which is three letters. Let me check the instructions again. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "N3", is that one word or two? The original text is "N3", which might be a single word, like a model number or something. So the unique words in ground truth would be {"N3"}.

Then the OCR output is "WOW". So we need to check if "WOW" contains "N3" considering the rules. But "WOW" doesn't have "N" or "3" in it. However, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But "WOW" vs "N3" – there's no overlap in letters. So even with typos, there's no way "WOW" could be a typo of "N3". So the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique words.

Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect, since no words match. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
