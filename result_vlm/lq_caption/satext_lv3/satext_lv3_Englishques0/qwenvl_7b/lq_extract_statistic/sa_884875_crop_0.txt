gt_text: FANSIPAN LEGEND
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FANSIPAN LEGEND" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has two words: "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. Let's see if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND", neither of these words are present in "100%". The OCR output is a percentage, which is unrelated to the words in the ground truth. There's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we consider typos or ignore case, "100%" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But in this case, there are no matches. So it falls into Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
