gt_text: MUSEUM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MUSEUM". The OCR output has "100%". 

Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "MUSEUM". The OCR output has "100%" which is a number and a percentage sign. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. 

Since "100%" doesn't contain the word "MUSEUM" or any of its variations (like considering typos, but "100%" is not related). The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated to the ground truth word. So according to category 3, it's incorrect because there's no match. 

I think the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 55
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 125
