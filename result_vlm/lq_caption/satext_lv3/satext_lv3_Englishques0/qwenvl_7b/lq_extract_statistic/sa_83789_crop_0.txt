Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "32" and the VLM OCR output is also "32". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is just "32".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "32". The OCR output is the same. So the unique words here are just "32" in both cases. Since they are exactly the same, there's no issue with order, case, spacing, or typos. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
