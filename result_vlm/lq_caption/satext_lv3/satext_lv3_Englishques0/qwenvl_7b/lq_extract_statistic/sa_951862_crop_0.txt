Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "154" and the VLM OCR output is also "154". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "154", so that's straightforward. Then step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are exactly the same.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "154". The OCR output also has "154". Since they're the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The other considerations: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about. The numbers are the same, and there are no extra spaces. Also, the note about small typos still counting as matches. But there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output matches exactly, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
