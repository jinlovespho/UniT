gt_text: 86
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "86" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, the ground truth is "86". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. But wait, the ground truth is a single number, "86", and the OCR output is "100%". So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "86". The OCR output has "100%" which is a different number. 

The rules also mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word ("86"), I need to check if that word appears in the OCR output. However, "100%" doesn't contain "86" as a substring or word. Even if we consider typos, "100%" is not a typo of "86". They are completely different numbers. 

Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But in this case, the OCR output has a percentage sign, which isn't present in the ground truth. However, the main issue is that the words themselves don't match. 

So, since the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match at all, and the output is unrelated.
