gt_text: DELTA
vlm_output: Delta

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DELTA" and the VLM OCR output is "Delta". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Delta", which is just the word Delta. 

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth is "DELTA", which is the same word but all caps. The instructions say to ignore capitalization, so "Delta" and "DELTA" are considered the same. Also, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "DELTA", and the OCR output has "Delta", which matches when case is ignored, that's a correct match. 

The categories say that if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), it's category 1. Here, there's only one word, and it matches. So the answer should be 1.
