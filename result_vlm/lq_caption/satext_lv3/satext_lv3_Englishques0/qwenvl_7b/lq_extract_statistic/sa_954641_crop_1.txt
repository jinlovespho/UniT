gt_text: 524+20
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "524+20". The VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth has the words "524", "+", and "20". Wait, but maybe the "+" is considered a symbol here. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "524+20", which is a single expression. But when they say "unique words", maybe they mean splitting by spaces? But there are no spaces in the ground truth. Hmm, maybe the OCR output is supposed to be split into words, but in this case, the ground truth is a single string without spaces. 

Wait, the ground truth is "524+20", which is a mathematical expression. The OCR output is "100%". The user says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But if the ground truth is a single string without spaces, does that mean the unique words are "524", "+", and "20"? Or is the entire "524+20" considered a single word? This is a bit confusing. 

The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If the ground truth is "524+20", maybe the words are considered as "524", "+", and "20". But the OCR output is "100%", which is a single word. So in that case, none of the words from the ground truth (524, +, 20) are present in the OCR output. So the answer would be category 3, since none of the words match. 

But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be interpreted as a number, like 100% is 100, and the ground truth is 524+20=544. But the problem says to compare based on the text content, not the numerical value. So the OCR output is "100%", which is a different number. The ground truth has "524", "+", "20". None of these are present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 3: incorrect.
