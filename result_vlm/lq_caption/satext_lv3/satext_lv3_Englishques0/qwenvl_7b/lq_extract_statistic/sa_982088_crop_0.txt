gt_text: 936
vlm_output: PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "936" and the VLM OCR output is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". Then, I compare this with the ground truth, which is "936". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth here is a number, "936". The OCR output is a phrase in Portuguese, which doesn't seem to have any numbers. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "936", which is a number. The OCR output has words like "PONTE", "DE", "SANTO", "DOMINGOS". None of these words are numbers. Since the ground truth is a number and the OCR output is text, there's no overlap in the words. 

Even if I consider typos or ignore case, the OCR output doesn't contain any numeric characters. The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Since "936" isn't present in the OCR output, there are no matches. Therefore, it should be category 3.
