gt_text: 30
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "30" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is the text to compare.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The ground truth has the unique words "30". Wait, but "30" is a number, not a word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, "30" is a single token here. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the categories. The unique words in the ground truth are just "30". The OCR output is "100%", which doesn't include "30" at all. So there's no match for the unique ground truth word. Also, the OCR output is "100%", which is a different number. So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, "100%" isn't even close to "30" in terms of numbers. There's no typo here, just a completely different number. So since there are no matches, it's category 3. 

I think that's right. The answer should be 3.
