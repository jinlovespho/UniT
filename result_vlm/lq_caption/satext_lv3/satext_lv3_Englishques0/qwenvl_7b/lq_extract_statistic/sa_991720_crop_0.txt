gt_text: SPEEDWAY
vlm_output: 1

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPEEDWAY" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just the number "1". 

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SPEEDWAY". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, but here the OCR output is a single number, not a word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SPEEDWAY". 

Now, the comparison rules: we need to check if any unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "1" is a number, not the word "SPEEDWAY". Even if we ignore capitalization and typos, there's no match here. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "SPEEDWAY" or any of its variations. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is "1", which doesn't relate to "SPEEDWAY" at all, it falls into category 3. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't even a word from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
