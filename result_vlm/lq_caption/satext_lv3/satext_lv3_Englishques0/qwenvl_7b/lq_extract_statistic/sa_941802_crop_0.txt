gt_text: CHUNCHEON
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CHUNCHEON" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "100%".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "CHUNCHEON". The OCR output has "100%", which is a percentage. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CHUNCHEON". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the same word. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR (ignoring case, spacing, typos). But here, "CHUNCHEON" isn't present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated. 

So, since there's no match for the ground truth word, it should be category 3—Incorrect. Even if there were typos, the OCR output here is completely different. No words match. So category 3.
