gt_text: KOMMUNISM
vlm_output: KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KOMMUNISM" and the VLM OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". So the words here are "KOMMUNISM", "ON", and "VANGLA".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "KOMMUNISM". The unique words in the ground truth are just "KOMMUNISM" (since it's a single word). 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output has "KOMMUNISM" exactly as in the ground truth, so that's a match. The other words "ON" and "VANGLA" are not in the ground truth. However, the ground truth only has one unique word, so we just need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

Since "KOMMUNISM" is present in the OCR output, even though there are additional words, the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "KOMMUNISM") are present. The other words don't affect the category since the requirement is only about the unique words from the ground truth. So the answer should be category 1.
