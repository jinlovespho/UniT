Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth is "AMB" and the OCR output is "1905". The user wants me to follow specific steps to determine the category.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1905", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "AMB", which are letters. 

Now, step 2 is to compare them with certain considerations. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

Wait, the ground truth is "AMB" which is three letters. The OCR output is "1905", which are numbers. So the OCR output has no letters, only numbers. The unique words in the ground truth are "AMB" (assuming it's one word). But the OCR output has "1905" which is a number. Since there's no overlap in characters between the two, even considering typos, numbers and letters are different. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but that's for when the characters are similar. For example, if the OCR had "AmB" instead of "AMB", that would be a match. But here, the OCR output is entirely numbers, which don't match any letters in the ground truth. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "AMB". The OCR output has "1905", which doesn't contain any of those letters. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since "1905" is unrelated to "AMB" and there's no overlap, the answer should be category 3.
