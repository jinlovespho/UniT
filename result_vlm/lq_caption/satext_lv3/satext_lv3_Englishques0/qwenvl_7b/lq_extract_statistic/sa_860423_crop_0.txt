gt_text: ИНФОРМАЦИЯ
vlm_output: 1998

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ" which is Russian for "information." The VLM OCR output is "1998." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1998," which is a number. Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is a word. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ."

Now, the OCR output is "1998." Since it's a number, it's not a word. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but here the OCR output is a number. The question is whether numbers can be considered as matching words. However, the ground truth is a word, not a number. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are present in OCR output. But the OCR output has no words, just numbers. So there's no match. Therefore, category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "1998" isn't a typo of "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ." So the answer should be 3.
