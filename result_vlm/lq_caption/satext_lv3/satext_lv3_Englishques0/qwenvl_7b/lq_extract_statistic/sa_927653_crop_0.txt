gt_text: FABBRI
vlm_output: 1046

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FABBRI" and the VLM OCR output is "1046". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1046", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is "FABBRI", which is a name, likely a surname.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is numbers, while the ground truth is letters. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "FABBRI". The OCR output has "1046", which are digits. Since there's no overlap in characters between the two (assuming "FABBRI" is all letters and "1046" is all numbers), there's no matching word. Even if we consider typos, "1046" doesn't resemble "FABBRI" in any way. The categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
