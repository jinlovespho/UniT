gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "HOLLYWOOD".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation. So even if there were differences in case, like "hollywood" vs "HOLLYWOOD", they would still match. But here they are exactly the same.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The OCR output is correct.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the category should be 1.

I don't see any issues here. The answer is definitely category 1.
