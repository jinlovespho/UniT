gt_text: TREZOR
vlm_output: TREZOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TREZOR" and the VLM OCR output is also "TREZOR". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TREZOR". The OCR output also has "TREZOR". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
