gt_text: TCM
vlm_output: W 4652 TCM

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TCM" and the VLM OCR output is "W 4652 TCM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has "W", "4652", and "TCM". But the ground truth is just "TCM". 

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TCM". The OCR output includes "TCM" as well. 

Next, I have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "TCM" which matches exactly with the ground truth. The other parts of the OCR output, like "W" and "4652", aren't part of the ground truth, so they can be ignored. 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos in "TCM" in the OCR output. 

Since the OCR output contains the exact word "TCM" (which is the only unique word in the ground truth), this should be considered a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
