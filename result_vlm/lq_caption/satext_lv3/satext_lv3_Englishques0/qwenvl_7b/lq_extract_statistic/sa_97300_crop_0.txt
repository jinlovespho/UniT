Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "in", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, both are just "in". 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and there's no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue here. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case because both are exactly "in".

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "in" and the OCR output also has "in", that's a full match. 

No other words are involved here. So the answer should be category 1.
