gt_text: EY
vlm_output: EY

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EY" and the VLM OCR output is also "EY". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "EY", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria given are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the words "EY". The OCR output is exactly the same, "EY". Since both are the same, there's no issue with typos, capitalization, or spacing. The unique words in the ground truth are just "EY", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, the only unique word is present. So this should be Category 1. There's no missing words or partial matches. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
