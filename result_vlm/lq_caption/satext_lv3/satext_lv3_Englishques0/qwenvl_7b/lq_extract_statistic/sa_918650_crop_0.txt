gt_text: AC
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AC", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "AC". Let's break down the comparison rules. 

The comparison is based on unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. The ground truth is "AC", which are letters. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "AC". The OCR output has "100%", which is a different set of characters. There's no overlap here. The rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, "100%" isn't even close to "AC" in terms of letters. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have the correct words. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
