gt_text: STREET
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STREET" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the steps provided.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "STREET", which is one word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "STREET". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "STREET" or any variation of it (like "street" lowercase or with typos), there's no match here. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output is completely different. It's not even a typo; it's a number. So there's no overlap in the words. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's not present, that's not the case. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But here, none match. So that's category 3: incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. 

I think the answer is category 3.
