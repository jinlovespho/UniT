gt_text: JBL
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "JBL" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "JBL", which is a brand name, I think. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage.

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has only one unique word: "JBL". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "JBL" is all caps, and the OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a percent sign. There's no overlap in the words. The OCR output doesn't have the word "JBL" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "JBL" in any way. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words from the ground truth.
