gt_text: BONIA
vlm_output: BONIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BONIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "BONIA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BONIA".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BONIA". The OCR output also has "BONIA". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "BONIA") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect elements here. The answer should be 1.
