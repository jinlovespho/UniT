gt_text: PayPal
vlm_output: PayPal

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PayPal" and the VLM OCR output is also "PayPal". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare the extracted text with the ground truth.

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Also, they say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PayPal". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same way. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So according to the categories, this should be category 1: Correct. There's no typo, everything matches perfectly. So the answer should be 1.
