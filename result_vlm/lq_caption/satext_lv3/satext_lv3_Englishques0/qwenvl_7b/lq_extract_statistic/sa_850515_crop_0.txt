gt_text: APA
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "APA" and the OCR output is "100". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth is "APA" which is three letters, and the OCR output is "100", which are numbers. Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "APA". The OCR output has "100", which is a different word. But maybe the OCR made a mistake, like recognizing numbers instead of letters. However, the guidelines mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, "100" isn't a typo of "APA" in terms of letters. The letters A, P, A are not similar to 1, 0, 0. So there's no matching words. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's "APA", even considering typos, it's not a match. So it would be category 3.
