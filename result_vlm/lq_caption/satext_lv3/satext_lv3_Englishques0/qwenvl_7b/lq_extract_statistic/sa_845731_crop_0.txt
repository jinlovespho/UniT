gt_text: CORVINUS
vlm_output: CINEMAS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "CORVINUS" and the OCR output is "CINEMAS". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "CINEMAS". Then, compare it with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. The unique words in the ground truth are just "CORVINUS" since it's one word. The OCR output is "CINEMAS", which is also one word. 

Now, checking if they match. The problem says to ignore capitalization, so both are uppercase, but even if they weren't, it's the same. However, the words themselves are different: "CORVINUS" vs. "CINEMAS". There's no overlap in letters that would suggest a typo. For example, "CORVINUS" has letters C, O, R, V, I, N, U, S. "CINEMAS" has C, I, N, E, M, A, S. The common letters are C, I, N, S. But the words are entirely different. 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output isn't a typo of the ground truth word. It's a completely different word. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have that word, even considering typos, it's not a match. So, category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if any part of the OCR output could be considered a match. For example, if the OCR output had "CORV" or something similar. But "CINEMAS" is not related. So the answer should be 3.
