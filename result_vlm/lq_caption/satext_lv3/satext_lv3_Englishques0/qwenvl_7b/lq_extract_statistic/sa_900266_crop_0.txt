gt_text: CHINA
vlm_output: CHINA EASTERN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHINA" and the VLM OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "CHINA EASTERN". So the words are "CHINA" and "EASTERN".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CHINA". The OCR output has two words: "CHINA" and "EASTERN". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to worry about the sequence. We need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "CHINA" is present in the OCR output, that's a match. 

Now, checking the other conditions: ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. Both texts are uppercase, no punctuation, and the OCR output has an extra space but that's ignored. Typos are considered as matches, but there are no typos here. 

The ground truth has only "CHINA" as the unique word. The OCR output includes "CHINA" and "EASTERN". Since all unique ground truth words (just "CHINA") are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

Wait, but the category 1 says "all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output". Since the OCR has "CHINA" which is the only unique word in the ground truth, that's a full match. Even though there's an extra word ("EASTERN") in the OCR output, the rules don't mention that as a problem. The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even if there are extra words in the OCR, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

So the answer should be 1.
