gt_text: OCBC Bank
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OCBC Bank" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then compare it with the ground truth. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two unique words: "OCBC" and "Bank". The OCR output is "100", which is a number. 

Now, comparing the words. The OCR output doesn't have "OCBC" or "Bank" in any form. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spaces, "100" is just numbers. There's no match for either of the ground truth words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since neither "OCBC" nor "Bank" are in the OCR output, it's category 3. 

Wait, but what about typos? The instruction says small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is completely different. It's not a typo, it's just numbers. So no match. So definitely category 3.
