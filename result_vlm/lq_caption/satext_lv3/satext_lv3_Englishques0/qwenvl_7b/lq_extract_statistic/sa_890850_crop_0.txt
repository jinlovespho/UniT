gt_text: OUTBACK
vlm_output: OUTBACK

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OUTBACK" and the VLM OCR output is also "OUTBACK". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "OUTBACK", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OUTBACK".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are identical.

Looking at the categories:
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "OUTBACK" which is the same as the ground truth, this meets category 1.
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all match. Not applicable here because all (the only one) matches.
3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Definitely not the case here.

So, the answer should be category 1.
