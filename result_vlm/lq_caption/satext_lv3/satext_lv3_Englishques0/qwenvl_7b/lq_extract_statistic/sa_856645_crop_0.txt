gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: 100%

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percentage sign. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "Bank". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Bank".

Now, checking if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. There's no mention of the word "Bank" here. Even if I ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, "100%" doesn't contain the word "Bank". 

Also, small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo of "Bank" in the OCR output. The output is completely different. So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. 

Wait, the OCR output is "100%", which is not related to "Bank" at all. So the answer should be category 3.
