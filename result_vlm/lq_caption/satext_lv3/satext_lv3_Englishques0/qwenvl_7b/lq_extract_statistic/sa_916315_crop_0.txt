gt_text: WOW
vlm_output: WOW

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "WOW" and the VLM OCR output is also "WOW". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "WOW".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "WOW". The OCR output also has "WOW". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and have no punctuation or spaces. So they match perfectly.

The category is determined by whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word, and it's present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. Even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos.

So the answer should be category 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 160
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 352
