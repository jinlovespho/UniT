gt_text: TURKISHAIRLINES
vlm_output: TURKISHAIRLINES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TURKISHAIRLINES" and the VLM OCR output is the same. The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, they want to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is one word: "TURKISHAIRLINES". The OCR output is the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are all caps and no spaces, that's not an issue. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word). Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. The answer should be 1.
