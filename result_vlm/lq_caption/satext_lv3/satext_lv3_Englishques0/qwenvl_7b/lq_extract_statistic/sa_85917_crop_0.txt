gt_text: nike

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "nike" and the VLM OCR output is also "nike". So, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "nike". Then step 2 is to compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "nike". The OCR output has "nike" as well. So, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing—though there's none here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches exactly. So the answer should be 1.
