gt_text: PEGASUS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PEGASUS" and the VLM OCR output is "1978". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1978", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "PEGASUS". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PEGASUS". The OCR output is "1978", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, considering the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "1978" isn't a word related to "PEGASUS". There's no overlap in words here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

Category 2 is for partial matches, but since there's no match at all, that doesn't apply. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1978" is a number and not related to "PEGASUS", this would be category 3. 

I should also check if there's any possibility of typos or other factors, but "1978" doesn't resemble "PEGASUS" in any way. So the answer should be category 3.
