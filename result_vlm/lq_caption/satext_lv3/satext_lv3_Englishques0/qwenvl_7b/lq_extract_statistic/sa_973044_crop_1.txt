gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: SHAKERS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHAKERS". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "SHAKERS".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both are the same word. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHAKERS". The OCR output also has "SHAKERS". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring order (but there's only one word here), case (both are uppercase), spacing (no spaces), and typos. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, there are no typos. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
