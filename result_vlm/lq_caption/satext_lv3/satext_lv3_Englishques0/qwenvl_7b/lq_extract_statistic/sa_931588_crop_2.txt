gt_text: 24
vlm_output: No parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "24" and the VLM OCR output is "No parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "No parking". Then compare it with the ground truth "24".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "24", which is a single word. So the unique words in ground truth are just "24".

Now, the OCR output is "No parking", which has two words: "No" and "parking". But the ground truth's unique words are "24". So the OCR output doesn't have "24" in it. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "No parking" doesn't contain "24" at all. There's no typo here; it's just a completely different text. 

So according to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has "24" and the OCR output has none of that, it's not correct. Then category 3 is incorrect: no words match, or output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be 3.
