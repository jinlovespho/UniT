gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. There are no typos here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "NIKE") are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer must be 1.
