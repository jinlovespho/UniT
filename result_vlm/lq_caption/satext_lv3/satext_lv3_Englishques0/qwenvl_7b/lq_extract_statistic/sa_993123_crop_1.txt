Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "HSBC".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has some specific rules. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is exactly "HSBC", same as the ground truth, so no issues here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "HSBC" which matches exactly, this fits category 1.

I don't see any partial matches or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
