gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: DALIAN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since both are exactly the same, the extracted text is "DALIAN".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in a different order, it would still be okay. But here, they are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "DALIAN". The OCR output also has "DALIAN". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. There are no typos here because they are exactly the same. 

So, according to the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, all unique words (which is just "DALIAN") are present. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
