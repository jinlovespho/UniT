gt_text: UNITED
vlm_output: 105-0742

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UNITED" and the VLM OCR output is "105-0742". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "105-0742", which is a string of numbers and a hyphen. The ground truth is the word "UNITED".

Now, moving to Step 2. The comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter, but we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "UNITED". The OCR output has numbers and a hyphen, which aren't words. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output doesn't have any letters; it's all numbers and a hyphen. So, there's no overlap in words between the ground truth and the OCR output. Even if we consider typos, the OCR output doesn't contain the letters U, N, I, T, E, D at all. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth.
