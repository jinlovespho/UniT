gt_text: ZAVOS
vlm_output: ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZAVOS" and the VLM OCR output is "ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER". There's no punctuation or spaces here, so the entire string is one continuous word.

Next, I need to compare this with the ground truth, which is "ZAVOS". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ZAVOS".

Now, I have to check if "ZAVOS" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER". Let's see if "ZAVOS" is a substring here. Yes, the first five letters are "ZAVOS", so the OCR output starts with the exact ground truth word. Even though there are more letters after, the presence of "ZAVOS" as a substring (and considering that the OCR might have added extra characters after) would count as a match. 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo in "ZAVOS" itself. The OCR output includes "ZAVOS" exactly, just followed by more text. Also, the rules say to ignore extra spaces, so even if there were spaces, they wouldn't matter. Since the OCR output contains the exact word "ZAVOS" (case-insensitive, but here both are uppercase), it's a match.

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just "ZAVOS") are present in the OCR output. So according to category 1, this is a correct match. The answer should be 1.
