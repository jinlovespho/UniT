gt_text: INS
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "INS", which is a single word. 

Next, I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth appear in the OCR output. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. The word "INS" isn't present here. 

The guidelines say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "10%" doesn't have any letters in common with "INS". Even if I consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "INS" in any way. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match at all, and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
