gt_text: GOVERNO
vlm_output: 1972

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GOVERNO" and the VLM OCR output is "1972". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "1972". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth has one word, "GOVERNO", and the OCR output is "1972". So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "GOVERNO". The OCR output has "1972", which is a number. Now, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. But "1972" isn't a word that matches "GOVERNO". Even if I ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "1972" is a number, not a word. Also, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "GOVERNO" is the only word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has no words that match it, even with typos considered, there's no match. So the category would be 3, incorrect. Because there's no words matching. Even if the OCR had a typo, like "governo" vs "governo", but here it's numbers. So answer is 3.
