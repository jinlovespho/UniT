Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FLUVIAL" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's just "1970".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "FLUVIAL". The OCR output has "1970", which is numbers. Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word each.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FLUVIAL".
- Ignore case, punctuation, spaces. But "1970" is numbers, not letters. So there's no overlap in characters. Also, "FLUVIAL" is a word related to rivers, and "1970" is a year. They don't share any letters. So there's no matching words here. Even with typos, but since they are completely different in terms of letters, even small typos wouldn't make them match. So according to the categories:

Category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1970" has no letters in common with "FLUVIAL", there's no match. So the answer should be 3.
