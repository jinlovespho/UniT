gt_text: Google

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Google". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. Typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

Since all unique ground truth words (just "Google") are present in the OCR output, according to category 1, that's a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect here. So the answer should be 1.
