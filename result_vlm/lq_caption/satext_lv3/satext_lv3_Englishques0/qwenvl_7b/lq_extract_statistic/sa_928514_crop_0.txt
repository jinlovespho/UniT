gt_text: DELIVER
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "DELIVER" and the OCR output is "10%". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%". So the extracted text is just "10%".

Step 2: Compare this with the ground truth, which is "DELIVER". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but small typos still count. 

Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "DELIVER". The OCR output is "10%". Let's break it down. The unique words in the ground truth are just "DELIVER". Now, the OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

So, the question is whether "10%" contains the word "DELIVER" in any form. But "10%" is "10 percent" or "ten percent", but that's not related to "deliver". There's no overlap in words here. The OCR output has no words that are part of the ground truth. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, etc., "10%" doesn't have any letters that form "deliver" or any part of it. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since there's no overlap, it's category 3. The OCR output is completely unrelated to the ground truth. Even if there was a typo, like if it was "delliver" or something, but here it's "10%", which is a number. So definitely category 3.
