gt_text: OYO
vlm_output: OYO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OYO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OYO".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "OYO" which is three letters. The OCR output is the same. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "OYO". The OCR output has "OYO" as well. Since they are the same, ignoring case (though both are uppercase here), and there are no typos, the comparison would be a full match.

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word, it's a perfect match. So the category should be 1.
