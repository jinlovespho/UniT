gt_text: CASINO
vlm_output: CASINO

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CASINO" and the VLM OCR output is also "CASINO". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "CASINO", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CASINO". The OCR output also has "CASINO". 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's a match. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a full match. 

No other words are present in the ground truth, so there's nothing else to check. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
