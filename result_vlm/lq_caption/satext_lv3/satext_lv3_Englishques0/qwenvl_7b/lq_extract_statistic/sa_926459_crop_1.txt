----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMERICA" and the VLM OCR output is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330". So, the words here are "RAILWAY" and "AMERICA5330". But wait, the ground truth is "AMERICA". 

Now, step two is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "AMERICA".

Next, we need to compare based on that. The OCR output has "AMERICA5330". The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. So, "AMERICA5330" has "AMERICA" followed by numbers. But the instruction says to ignore punctuation and extra/missing spaces. However, the numbers here are not punctuation. Wait, the instruction says to ignore punctuation, but numbers might not be considered punctuation. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. 

Wait, the instruction says: "Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So, numbers might not be considered here. But the OCR output has "AMERICA5330" which is "AMERICA" plus "5330". Since the ground truth is just "AMERICA", do we consider "AMERICA5330" as containing "AMERICA"? If we ignore extra characters, but the instruction says to ignore punctuation, not numbers. Wait, the instruction says "ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So numbers aren't mentioned here. 

But the problem also says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had a typo like "AMERIKA" or "AMERCA", that would count. But here, the OCR output has "AMERICA5330", which is the correct word "AMERICA" followed by numbers. The numbers might be considered extra characters. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. But numbers aren't spaces. So maybe the numbers are considered as part of the word? 

Alternatively, perhaps the OCR output is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330", which includes "AMERICA" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "AMERICA" as a unique word. So the OCR output must contain "AMERICA" as a word, even if it's part of a longer string. But the OCR output has "AMERICA5330" which is a single word. 

Wait, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "AMERICA". So the OCR output must have "AMERICA" as a word. But in the OCR output, it's "AMERICA5330", which is not exactly "AMERICA", but perhaps the numbers are considered as typos or extra characters. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not numbers. So maybe the numbers are not ignored. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as "RAILWAY" and "AMERICA5330" as separate words. The ground truth is "AMERICA". So, does "AMERICA5330" contain "AMERICA" as a substring? If the comparison is based on whether the OCR output contains the ground truth words as substrings, ignoring case, punctuation, etc., then "AMERICA5330" would contain "AMERICA" as a substring. 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "AMERICA" as a unique word. The OCR output has "AMERICA5330" as a word. If we ignore extra characters (like numbers), then "AMERICA5330" would be considered as containing "AMERICA". However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, not numbers. 

This is a bit ambiguous. If the OCR output includes "AMERICA" as a substring, even with numbers attached, does that count as a match? The problem says that small typos still count as matches. But adding numbers might be considered a larger error. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. If numbers are considered part of the word, then "AMERICA5330" is not the same as "AMERICA", but if we consider that the OCR might have added numbers by mistake, perhaps it's a typo. 

But the problem states that small typos still count. However, adding numbers might not be a small typo. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330", and we need to check if "AMERICA" is present. Since "AMERICA" is a substring of "AMERICA5330", even if it's not a standalone word, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. 

Wait, the instruction says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." The ground truth has "AMERICA" as a unique word. The OCR output has "RAILWAY" and "AMERICA5330". So, does "AMERICA5330" count as containing "AMERICA"? If we ignore extra characters (like the numbers), then yes. But the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. Numbers aren't spaces. However, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. 

So, if the OCR output has "AMERICA5330", and we ignore punctuation (but numbers are not punctuation), then the OCR output's word is "AMERICA5330". But the ground truth is "AMERICA". So, unless we consider the numbers as typos, which might be a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330" and we need to extract the words. If we split the OCR output into words, it's "RAILWAY" and "AMERICA5330". The ground truth is "AMERICA". So, does "AMERICA5330" contain "AMERICA" as a word? If we remove the numbers, it would be "AMERICA", but the instruction doesn't mention removing numbers. 

This is tricky. If the OCR output has "AMERICA5330" and we consider that the numbers are extra, but the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. Since numbers aren't spaces, maybe we can't ignore them. Therefore, "AMERICA5330" is not the same as "AMERICA", so it doesn't match. But then, the OCR output has "RAILWAY" and "AMERICA5330". Neither of these words is "AMERICA", so the answer would be category 3. But that seems incorrect because "AMERICA" is a substring of "AMERICA5330". 

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth is "AMERICA" as a single word. The OCR output has "AMERICA5330" which is not the same word. Unless the OCR output is considered as having "AMERICA" as a typo. But the instruction says small typos still count as matches. Adding numbers might not be a small typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "RAILWAY AMERICA5330", and we should consider that "AMERICA" is present in the OCR output. If we ignore the numbers, then it's a match. But the instruction says to ignore punctuation and extra spaces, not numbers. 

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, but considering that the OCR output does contain "AMERICA" as a substring (even with numbers), and the instruction says that small typos still count, maybe it's considered a correct match. Therefore, the category would be 1. But I'm not entirely sure. However, since the ground truth is "AMERICA" and the OCR output includes "AMERICA" as part of a longer string, and the problem allows for small typos, I think the correct category is 1.
