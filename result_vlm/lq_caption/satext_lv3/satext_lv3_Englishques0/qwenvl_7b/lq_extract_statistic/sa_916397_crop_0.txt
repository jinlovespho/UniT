gt_text: RATHAUS
vlm_output: 1903

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RATHAUS" and the VLM OCR output is "1903". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1903", which is a number. The ground truth is "RATHAUS", which is a word. 

Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RATHAUS". The OCR output is "1903", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all match, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "RATHAUS" is a word and "1903" is a number, there's no overlap. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Even if we consider typos, "1903" doesn't resemble "RATHAUS" in any way. So, there are no matching words. Therefore, the category should be 3.
