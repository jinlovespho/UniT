gt_text: COTTAGE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "COTTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "COTTAGE".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "COTTAGE". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't have the word "COTTAGE" in any form. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, etc., "100%" is not related to "COTTAGE". There's no overlap in words here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no match at all, the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
