gt_text: MADISON
vlm_output: The image contains no visible text.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MADISON," and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains no visible text." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is clearly stating that there's no visible text in the image. So the extracted text is "The image contains no visible text."

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MADISON," which is a single word. The comparison criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "MADISON." Now, looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The," "image," "contains," "no," "visible," "text." None of these words are "MADISON" or any variation of it. The OCR says there's no visible text, which implies that it didn't detect any text, including "MADISON."

The categories are:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: At least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: No words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

Since the OCR output doesn't contain "MADISON" or any of its possible variations (like lowercase "madison"), there are no matches. The OCR output is stating that there's no text, which directly contradicts the ground truth. Therefore, this falls under category 3, as there are no matches and the output is largely wrong (it's claiming there's no text when there actually is).
