gt_text: DIVING
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DIVING" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth "DIVING". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DIVING". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. However, "100%" doesn't contain the word "DIVING" in any form. Even if we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, "100%" is just numbers and a symbol. There's no overlap with the word "DIVING". 

Small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo of "DIVING" in the OCR output. The OCR output is entirely unrelated. So, according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words are present, it falls under category 3: Incorrect.
