gt_text: 123
vlm_output: SUV

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "123" and the VLM OCR output is "SUV". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "SUV".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "123", which is a string of numbers. The OCR output is "SUV", which are letters. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the ground truth here is "123", which is a single word (assuming it's considered as one word here). The OCR output is "SUV", which is another single word. 

But the problem is that "123" is numeric and "SUV" is alphabetic. There's no overlap in characters or words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "123", and the OCR output has "SUV". Since they are completely different, there's no match. 

Also, considering the categories: category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 3 is when no words match or it's unrelated. So this would be category 3.
