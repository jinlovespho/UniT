gt_text: Long
vlm_output: Long

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Long" and the VLM OCR output is also "Long". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Long", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are just the single word "Long".

Now, considering the comparison criteria: we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Long". The OCR output also has "Long". 

The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

Since all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "Long") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or any issues. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
