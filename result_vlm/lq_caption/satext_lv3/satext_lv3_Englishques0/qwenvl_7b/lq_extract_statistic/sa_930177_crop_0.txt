gt_text: MAIRIE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAIRIE", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, step 2 says to compare with the ground truth considering word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth has the word "MAIRIE". The OCR output is "100%". Let's break it down. The unique words in ground truth are just "MAIRIE". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Now, checking if any of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. The ground truth word is "MAIRIE", which is a French word for "municipality" or "town hall". There's no overlap in the words. Even if we ignore case and punctuation, "100%" doesn't contain any letters that match "MAIRIE". 

So, the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the correct word. Even if there were typos, like if it was "mairie" with some letters, but here it's numbers. So definitely category 3.
