gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Nikon".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon". The OCR output also has "Nikon". 

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. There's no punctuation or spaces to worry about. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since both are exactly the same, it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
