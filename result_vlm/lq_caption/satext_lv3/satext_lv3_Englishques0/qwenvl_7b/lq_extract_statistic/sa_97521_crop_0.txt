gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD BLVD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "HOLLYWOOD", which is one unique word. So we need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "HOLLYWOOD" (same as ground truth) and "BLVD" which is a different word. But since the ground truth only has "HOLLYWOOD", we focus on that.
- Small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo in "HOLLYWOOD" between the two. The OCR output has "HOLLYWOOD" exactly as in the ground truth, just with an extra "BLVD" added.

So the unique words in the ground truth are {"HOLLYWOOD"}. The OCR output has {"HOLLYWOOD", "BLVD"}. The set of unique words from the ground truth is fully present in the OCR output (since "HOLLYWOOD" is there). Even though there's an extra word ("BLVD"), the requirement is to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "HOLLYWOOD" is present, and there are no typos, this would fall under category 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to contain all the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, which is present. Even though the OCR output has an extra word, that's allowed. The categories are about whether all the ground truth words are present. So category 1 is correct here. 

Therefore, the answer should be 1.
