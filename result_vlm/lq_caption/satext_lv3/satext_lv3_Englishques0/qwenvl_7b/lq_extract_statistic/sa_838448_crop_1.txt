gt_text: BRÜCKE
vlm_output: 10

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BRÜCKE" and the VLM OCR output is "10". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "10".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "BRÜCKE". The OCR output is "10", which is a number. Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here the OCR output has no words, just numbers. Wait, but maybe "10" is a typo or a number that's supposed to represent something else? But according to the rules, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "BRÜCKE", which is a German word for bridge. The OCR output is "10", which is not a word but a number. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "10" doesn't contain the word "BRÜCKE" or any of its variations (even with typos), there's no match. Also, "10" is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be category 3.
