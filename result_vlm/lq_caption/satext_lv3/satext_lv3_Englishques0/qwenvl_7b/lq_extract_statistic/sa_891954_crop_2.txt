gt_text: 101
vlm_output: 101

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "101" and the VLM OCR output is also "101". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "101", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but here both texts are just a single number. The unique words in the ground truth are just "101". The OCR output also has "101", so they match exactly. 

Considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But in this case, there's nothing to ignore because both are the same. Also, typos are considered as matches if they're small, but here there are no typos. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it fits category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. So the answer should be 1.
