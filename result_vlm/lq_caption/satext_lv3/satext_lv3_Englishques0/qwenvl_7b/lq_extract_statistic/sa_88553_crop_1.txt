gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Nikon".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Also, they mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon". The OCR output also has "Nikon". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches perfectly. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, which they are here. So the answer should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The OCR output is exactly correct according to the given criteria.
