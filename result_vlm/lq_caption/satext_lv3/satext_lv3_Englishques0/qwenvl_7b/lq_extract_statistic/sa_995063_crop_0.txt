gt_text: CMA
vlm_output: CHINA RAILWAY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth is "CMA" and the OCR output is "CHINA RAILWAY". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "CHINA RAILWAY". Then, compare it with the ground truth considering the given rules.

The ground truth words are "CMA". The OCR output has "CHINA" and "RAILWAY". Now, checking if any of these words match. The problem says to consider unique words in the ground truth, which is just "CMA". 

But the OCR output doesn't have "CMA" in any form. The words are "CHINA" and "RAILWAY". Even if we ignore case, capitalization, etc., there's no match. The ground truth is three letters, and the OCR output has two longer words. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
