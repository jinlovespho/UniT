gt_text: SALVADOR
vlm_output: 1000

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SALVADOR" and the OCR output is "1000". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1000", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "SALVADOR".

Now, step two says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SALVADOR".

But the OCR output is "1000", which is numbers, not letters. So there's no overlap in words. The instructions also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but here the OCR output doesn't have any letters. Also, small typos count as matches, but in this case, there's no letters at all. So "1000" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output is entirely unrelated since it's numbers instead of the expected name. So the answer should be 3.
