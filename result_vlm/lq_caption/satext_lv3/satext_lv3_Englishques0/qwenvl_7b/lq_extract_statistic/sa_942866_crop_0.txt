gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: QATAR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "QATAR". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "QATAR", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result here. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "QATAR". The OCR output also has "QATAR", so that's a match. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are all caps and no spaces or punctuation, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos would still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the category should be 1.
