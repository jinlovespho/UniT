gt_text: Canon
vlm_output: Canon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Canon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Canon". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Canon".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Canon". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, all unique words (which is just "Canon") are present. So this should be category 1.
