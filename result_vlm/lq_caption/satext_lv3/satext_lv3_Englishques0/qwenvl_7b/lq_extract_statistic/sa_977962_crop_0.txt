gt_text: SCHOOL
vlm_output: Kingswood School

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SCHOOL" and the VLM OCR output is "Kingswood School". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Kingswood School". So the extracted text is just that.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SCHOOL". The OCR output has "Kingswood" and "School". 

Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I can ignore the order. The ground truth has only one unique word: "SCHOOL". The OCR output has two words: "Kingswood" and "School". 

But the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just {"SCHOOL"}. The OCR output has {"Kingswood", "School"}. 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. The OCR has "School" which is the same as "SCHOOL" if we ignore capitalization. So "School" and "SCHOOL" are considered the same here. 

So the OCR output contains "School", which is a match for "SCHOOL". Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just one) are present in the OCR output. 

Even though there's an extra word "Kingswood" in the OCR output, the rules say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So as long as all of those are present, it's category 1. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—just an extra word. The presence of an extra word doesn't disqualify it as long as all required words are there. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
