gt_text: JOAN
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JOAN" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is the name "JOAN". 

Now, moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "JOAN" (which is a single word). The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percent sign. The instructions mention ignoring punctuation, so maybe the percent sign is considered as part of the text. However, "100%" is a numerical value, not a word. The ground truth is a proper noun, a name. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "JOAN". The OCR output has "100%", which is not a word that matches "JOAN" in any way. Even if we consider ignoring punctuation, "100" is a number, and "JOAN" is a name. There's no overlap in the words. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "JOAN" or any variation that could be considered a typo. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since "JOAN" isn't in the OCR output, this isn't met. Category 2 requires at least one but not all unique words to match. But there are no matches here. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "JOAN" and there are no matching words, this falls into Category 3.
