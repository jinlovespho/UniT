gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "NIKE", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both have the same word, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and no spaces, so that's fine.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

The categories are:

1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. Since the ground truth has "NIKE" and the OCR output has "NIKE", that's a match. So category 1 applies here.

I don't see any issues. The answer should be 1.
