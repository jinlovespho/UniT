gt_text: CONTAINER
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CONTAINER" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "CONTAINER". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CONTAINER". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. Since "CONTAINER" isn't in "100%", this doesn't fit.
- Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words matching. But there's only one unique word in the ground truth, so if it's not present, this category doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is for no words matching or the output being unrelated. Since "100%" doesn't contain "CONTAINER" and is unrelated, this seems to fit.

I should also check if there's any possibility of a typo or alternative interpretation. "100%" doesn't resemble "CONTAINER" even with typos. The OCR output is a number, while the ground truth is a noun. They are unrelated in meaning and content. 

Therefore, the correct category is 3.
