gt_text: NANOS
vlm_output: NANOS

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "NANOS" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANOS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "NANOS", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NANOS".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "NANOS". The OCR output is exactly the same. So when we compare, since both are the same word, even if there were typos, but here there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NANOS", and the OCR output has that exact word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, and it's a match, it's category 1. There's no case difference because both are uppercase, no extra spaces or punctuation. So the answer should be 1.
