gt_text: STUDIOS
vlm_output: STUDIOS

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STUDIOS" and the VLM OCR output is also "STUDIOS". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "STUDIOS", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "STUDIOS".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case since both are the same.

The categories are:
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all match.
3 — Incorrect if none match or the output is wrong/unrelated.

Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, all unique words (just "STUDIOS") are present. So according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no discrepancy here. Even if there were minor typos, like "Studios" vs "STUDIOS", it would still count as a match due to the ignore capitalization rule. But since they are identical, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the category is 1.
