gt_text: SST
vlm_output: Kite

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SST" and the VLM OCR output is "Kite". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "Kite". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The ground truth has the words "SST" and the OCR output has "Kite". 

Now, looking at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "SST", which is one unique word. The OCR output is "Kite", which is another unique word. 

The comparison needs to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. However, "SST" and "Kite" are completely different words. There's no overlap here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since there's no match between "SST" and "Kite", the category should be 3. 

Wait, but the ground truth is just one word, so if the OCR output doesn't have that word, even if it's a different word, it's category 3. Yes, that's right. So the answer is 3.
