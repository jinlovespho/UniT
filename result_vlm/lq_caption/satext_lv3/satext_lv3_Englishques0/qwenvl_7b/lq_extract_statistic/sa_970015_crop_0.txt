gt_text: APL
vlm_output: APL

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "APL" and the VLM OCR output is also "APL". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "APL".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "APL". The OCR output also has "APL", so all unique words match.

They mentioned ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, no typos since they're identical. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
