gt_text: ROZA
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROZA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". So the extracted text is just that.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ROZA". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "ROZA". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

But wait, the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word in the ground truth. The OCR output has a different word. Also, the rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, "100%" has numbers and a percentage sign, which aren't in "ROZA". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). Here, the ground truth has "ROZA" and the OCR output has "100%", which is not a match. So there are no matches. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "ROZA", this would be category 3. Even if there were typos, but in this case, the words are completely different. So the answer should be 3.
