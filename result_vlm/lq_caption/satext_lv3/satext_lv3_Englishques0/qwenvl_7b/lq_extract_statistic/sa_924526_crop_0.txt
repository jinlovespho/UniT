gt_text: Hilton
vlm_output: Hilton

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Hilton" and the VLM OCR output is also "Hilton". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Hilton".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Hilton". The OCR output also has "Hilton". 

Next, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case—no punctuation, same capitalization, and same spacing. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
