gt_text: Museo
vlm_output: Museo Correr

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Museo" and the VLM OCR output is "Museo Correr". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is "Museo Correr".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has the word "Museo" (which is the same as in the OCR output). The OCR output has an additional word, "Correr". 

Now, the categories are based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Museo". The OCR output includes "Museo" and "Correr". Since "Museo" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, the category should be 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present. The extra word doesn't affect the count here because the category is based on the presence of all ground truth words, not the absence of extra ones. Also, considering that typos are allowed but there are none here, and capitalization/punctuation are ignored, which isn't an issue here. So the answer is category 1.
