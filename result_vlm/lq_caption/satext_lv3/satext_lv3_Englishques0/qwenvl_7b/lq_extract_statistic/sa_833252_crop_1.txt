Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here because the OCR output is exactly "easyJet", so the extracted text is the same.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet". The OCR output is the same word. Even if there were typos, like maybe "easyjet" lowercase, it would still count because of ignoring case. But here, they are exactly the same. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, the answer should be 1.
