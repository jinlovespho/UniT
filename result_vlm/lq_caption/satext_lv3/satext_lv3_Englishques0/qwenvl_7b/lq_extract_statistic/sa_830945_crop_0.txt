gt_text: HYBRID4
vlm_output: HYBRID4

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HYBRID4", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both texts are the same.

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "HYBRID4". The OCR output also has the same word. 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not an issue. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has that same word, it meets Category 1. 

There's no possibility of Category 2 here because all words match. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is wrong. That's not the case here. 

So, the answer should be Category 1.
