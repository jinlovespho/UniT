gt_text: Cannabis
vlm_output: Cannabis

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Cannabis" and the VLM OCR output is also "Cannabis". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we need to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Cannabis". The OCR output also has "Cannabis". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization (both start with uppercase C) and there's no punctuation or spaces to consider here. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Cannabis") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer is definitely category 1.
