gt_text: HARVARD
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HARVARD" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". So, the extracted text is just "100%".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HARVARD". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage, not the word "Harvard" or any variation of it.

Looking at the categories:

1. Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. The ground truth has "HARVARD" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the word. So no match here.

2. Slightly correct: At least one but not all unique words match. But there are no matching words between "HARVARD" and "100%". The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. So this category doesn't apply either.

3. Incorrect: No words match, or output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "HARVARD" and there's no overlap in words, this fits category 3.

Wait, but the instructions mention "small typos still count as matches". However, in this case, the OCR output isn't even a typo of the ground truth word. It's a completely different string. So there's no match at all. Therefore, category 3 is correct.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 268
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 620
