gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: UIT

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "UIT". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "UIT", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly "UIT".

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UIT". The OCR output also has "UIT". So, the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, in this case, both texts are the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either.

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not a factor.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has the same word, this meets category 1.

I don't see any partial matches or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. Therefore, the correct category is 1.
