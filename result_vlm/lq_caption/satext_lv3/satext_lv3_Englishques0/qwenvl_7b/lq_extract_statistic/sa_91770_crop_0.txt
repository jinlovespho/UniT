Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "28" and the VLM OCR output is also "28". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "28", so the extracted text is the same.

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the number "28". The OCR output is exactly "28". Since both are the same, there's no issue with typos, spacing, or order. The unique words in the ground truth are just "28", and the OCR output contains that exact word. So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, everything matches. So the answer should be 1.
