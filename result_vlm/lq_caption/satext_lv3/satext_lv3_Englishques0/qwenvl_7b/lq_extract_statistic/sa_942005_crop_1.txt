gt_text: V10

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "V10" and the VLM OCR output is also "V10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "V10", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "V10". The OCR output also has "V10". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "V10") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct.
