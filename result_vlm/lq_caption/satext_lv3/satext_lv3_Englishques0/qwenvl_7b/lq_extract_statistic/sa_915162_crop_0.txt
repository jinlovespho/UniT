Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUAWEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "HUAWEI". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "HUAWEI", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "HUAWEI". The OCR output is the same word. So when comparing, since they are identical, even if there were minor typos, it's considered a match. But here there are no typos. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, all unique words (just one) are present. So this should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The output is correct. So the answer is 1.
