gt_text: GIORGIO
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GIORGIO" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percent sign. The ground truth is the name "GIORGIO".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth has one unique word: "GIORGIO". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number. 

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth's unique word is "GIORGIO". The OCR output has "100%", which is not a word that matches "GIORGIO" even with typos, case, or spacing. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but "100%" is not a typo of "GIORGIO". They are completely different. Also, the OCR output doesn't have any letters in common with "GIORGIO" except maybe 'G' if we stretch it, but "100%" has no letters. So there's no match. 

Therefore, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect.
