Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Steelers" and the VLM OCR output is also "Steelers". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Steelers".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Steelers". The OCR output also has "Steelers". So, the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "Steelers", there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just one) are present. So this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any missing words. The OCR output isn't empty or unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
