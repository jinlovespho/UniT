gt_text: mandin
vlm_output: easypar

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "mandin" and the VLM OCR output is "easypar". I need to compare these two according to the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is already "easypar", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, and small typos are still considered matches.

The ground truth is "mandin". Let me check if that's a single word or multiple words. It looks like one word. The OCR output is "easypar", which is also one word. 

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has "mandin", and the OCR output has "easypar". Are these words related? Let's see. "Mandin" could be a name or a typo of "mandarin" maybe, but the OCR output is "easypar". There's no overlap in letters between "mandin" and "easypar" except maybe 'a' and 'p' in "easypar" and 'a' in "mandin". But that's not enough for a match. 

The instructions say that small typos still count as matches. However, "mandin" and "easypar" are entirely different words. There's no common letters that would indicate a typo. For example, if the OCR had "mandin" but with a typo like "mandin" vs "manden", that would be a match. But here, the OCR output is a completely different word. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "mandin", and the OCR output has "easypar", which doesn't match "mandin" even with typos considered, then there are no matching words. 

Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since "easypar" is unrelated to "mandin", the answer should be 3.
