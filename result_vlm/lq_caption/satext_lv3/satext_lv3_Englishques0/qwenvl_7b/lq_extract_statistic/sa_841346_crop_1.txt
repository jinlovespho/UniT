gt_text: RUSSIA
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RUSSIA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "RUSSIA".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RUSSIA". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Next, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number, not a word. The ground truth word is "RUSSIA", which is a proper noun. The OCR output doesn't have any letters that match "RUSSIA". Even if we ignore punctuation, "100%" becomes "100", which is a number. There's no overlap in words here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match. Since the OCR output has no words that match "RUSSIA", even with typos, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
