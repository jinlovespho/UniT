gt_text: MIRAI
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRAI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "MIRAI". Let's break down the comparison. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. The ground truth is a proper noun, possibly a name or a term. Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in the ground truth, that's straightforward.
- The unique words in the ground truth are just "MIRAI". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number. Are there any matches here? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, "MIRAI" is the only word we're looking for. The OCR output doesn't have "MIRAI" in any form. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "MIRAI". They are completely different. Also, ignoring capitalization and punctuation, "100%" would still be "100" without the %, but that's a number, not the word "MIRAI".

So, since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, according to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear. Here, none do.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But there are no matches here.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "MIRAI", this would fall under category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
