gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: RESTAURACJA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "RESTAURACJA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking for case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and single word. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, but since both are uppercase, that's already matching. There are no typos mentioned here, so the OCR output is exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since they are exactly the same, it's a correct match. So the answer should be 1.
