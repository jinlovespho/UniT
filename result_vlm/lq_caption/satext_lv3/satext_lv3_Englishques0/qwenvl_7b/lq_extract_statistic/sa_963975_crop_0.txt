gt_text: AIDAstella
vlm_output: AIDA

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIDAstella" and the VLM OCR output is "AIDA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "AIDA". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The ground truth has the word "AIDAstella", which is one word. The OCR output has "AIDA".

Now, considering that we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "AIDAstella". The OCR output has "AIDA". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. The OCR output is missing the "stella" part. But the question says small typos still count as matches. However, "AIDA" is missing the "stella" part entirely. Is that considered a typo or a missing part?

Wait, the ground truth is "AIDAstella" which is a single word. The OCR output is "AIDA". So, the OCR output is missing the "stella" part. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have that exact word (even with typos allowed), but maybe "AIDA" is part of it. However, the instructions say that small typos count as matches. But "AIDA" is not a typo of "AIDAstella", it's a truncation. So maybe it's not considered a match. 

So, since the OCR output has "AIDA" and the ground truth has "AIDAstella", but the OCR output is missing the "stella" part. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output doesn't have that word (even with typos), then the category would be 3? Or maybe 2? Because "AIDA" is part of the ground truth word. Wait, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "AIDAstella". The OCR output has "AIDA", which is a substring but not the same word. So since the OCR output doesn't have the exact word (even with typos), then it's not matching. Therefore, category 3? Because no words match. But maybe "AIDA" is considered a partial match? Wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches", but "AIDA" is not a typo of "AIDAstella", it's missing part of it. So maybe that's not considered a typo. Therefore, the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique words. So category 3: Incorrect. But maybe the user considers "AIDA" as part of "AIDAstella" and counts it as a partial match. But according to the rules, the unique words in the ground truth must be present in the OCR output. Since "AIDAstella" is the only unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have that, even if it's a substring, it's not a match. Therefore, category 3.
