gt_text: FONTE

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "FONTE" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "1970", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FONTE", which is a word in Portuguese meaning "source" or "font".

Now, step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FONTE". The OCR output has "1970", which is a number, not a word. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but in this case, the OCR output is entirely numbers. The ground truth is a word, so there's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we consider typos, "1970" doesn't resemble "FONTE" in any way. Since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique word, it falls under category 3, which is incorrect. There's no match at all, so it's not partially correct or correct. The answer should be 3.
