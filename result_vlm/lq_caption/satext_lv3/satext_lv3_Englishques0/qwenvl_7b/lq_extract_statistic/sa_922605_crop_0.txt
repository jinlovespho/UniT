gt_text: Official

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Official" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "Official". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "Official", we need to check if that word appears in the OCR output.

But the OCR output is "100", which is numbers. There's no mention of the word "Official" here. The OCR output doesn't have any letters, just digits. So, the unique word from the ground truth isn't present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no match here, the category should be 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated to the ground truth word. The numbers don't relate to the word "Official" in any way, considering the rules about ignoring case, spacing, etc., but there's no overlap in words. So the answer is 3.
