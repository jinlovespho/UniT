Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "maje" and the VLM OCR output is also "maje". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "maje", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are exactly "maje".

Next, the comparison should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "maje". The OCR output also has the same word. The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, both are lowercase and have no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "maje" is present in both, and there's only one unique word, this meets Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The OCR output isn't empty or unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
