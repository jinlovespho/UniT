Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "M&S" and the VLM OCR output is also "M&S". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "M&S", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "M&S". The OCR output is exactly the same. Let's check each condition. Since the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly, all unique words (which is just "M&S") are present. Word order isn't an issue here because there's only one word. Capitalization and spacing aren't a factor since both are the same. There are no typos here either. 

So according to the categories, Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, which is exactly the case here. There's no partial match or no match. Therefore, the answer should be Category 1.
