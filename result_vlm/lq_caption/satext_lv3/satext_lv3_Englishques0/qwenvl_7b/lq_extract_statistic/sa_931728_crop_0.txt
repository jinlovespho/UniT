gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UBS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the number 10 with a percentage sign. 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "UBS", which is an acronym, probably for a company like UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland). 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UBS". 

Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth appear in the OCR output. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a symbol. "UBS" is an acronym with letters, so there's no overlap in characters or words. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but in this case, the OCR output doesn't even have any letters that match "UBS". The percentage sign and the numbers are not part of the ground truth's unique words. 

Also, the rules say that small typos still count as matches, but since the OCR output doesn't have any letters at all, there's no possibility of a typo here. 

So, the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and incorrect.
