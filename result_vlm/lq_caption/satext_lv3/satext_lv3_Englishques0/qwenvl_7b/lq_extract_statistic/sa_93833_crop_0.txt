gt_text: Institut
vlm_output: PTBInstitut Berlin

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Institut" and the VLM OCR output is "PTBInstitut Berlin". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PTBInstitut Berlin". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Institut". The OCR output has two words: "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin". 

Now, considering the comparison rules. Word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "Institut". 

Looking at the OCR output words: "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin". Let's check if "Institut" is present in the OCR output. The first word is "PTBInstitut". If I ignore capitalization, the original ground truth is "Institut" (lowercase 'i'?), but the OCR has "Institut" with uppercase 'I'? Wait, the ground truth is "Institut" which is capitalized, but the OCR output's first word is "PTBInstitut" which starts with uppercase 'P', then 'T', 'B', then 'Institut' with uppercase 'I'. 

But the rules say to ignore capitalization. So "PTBInstitut" would be considered as "ptbinstitut" if we ignore case, but the ground truth is "Institut". However, the OCR output has "Institut" as part of "PTBInstitut". So the word "Institut" is present in the OCR output as part of "PTBInstitut". Wait, but the OCR output's first word is "PTBInstitut", which includes "Institut" as a substring. However, the comparison is based on unique words. So does "PTBInstitut" count as containing "Institut"? The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "Institut" as a unique word. The OCR output's words are "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has {"Institut"}. The OCR output has {"PTBInstitut", "Berlin"}. So the question is whether "PTBInstitut" is considered to contain "Institut" as a word. But the OCR output's first word is "PTBInstitut" which is a single word. If the OCR output's word is "PTBInstitut", does that count as matching "Institut"? 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output's word is "PTBInstitut" which is not a typo of "Institut" but has additional letters at the beginning. So "PTBInstitut" is not "Institut" but includes it as a substring. However, the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has a word that is a superset of the ground truth word with additional letters, does that count as a match?

Wait, the rules say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has "Institut". The OCR output's words are "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin". So the OCR output has "Institut" as part of "PTBInstitut"? But it's not a separate word. The OCR output's first word is "PTBInstitut", which is a single word. So does that count as containing "Institut"? 

This is a bit ambiguous. If the OCR output has a word that contains the ground truth word as a substring, but it's not an exact match, then according to the rules, would that count? The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But "PTBInstitut" is not a typo of "Institut" but has extra letters. However, the rule says "ignore extra/missing spaces" but not sure about extra letters. 

Wait, the rules say: "Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So maybe the presence of extra letters is not considered, but the problem says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output had "Institut" with a typo, like "Institut" with a missing letter, that would count. But here, "PTBInstitut" has more letters at the beginning. So that's not a typo but an addition. 

But the problem says that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "Institut". The OCR output has "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin". So the OCR output doesn't have "Institut" as a separate word. Therefore, none of the OCR output's words exactly match "Institut" (ignoring case and typos). 

But wait, "PTBInstitut" includes "Institut" as a substring. However, the rules don't mention substring matches. They mention that the set of unique words in the ground truth should be present in the OCR output. So if the OCR output's words are "PTBInstitut" and "Berlin", and the ground truth is "Institut", then the OCR output does not contain "Institut" as a word. Therefore, the category would be 3, since no words match. 

But wait, the OCR output's first word is "PTBInstitut" which includes "Institut" as part of it. However, the rules don't specify that substrings count. The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output's word is "PTBInstitut", it's not the same as "Institut", even if it contains it. Therefore, the correct category would be 3, because none of the OCR output's words exactly match the ground truth's unique words. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's first word is considered as "Institut" with some prefix. But the rules don't allow for that. So the answer is 3. But wait, the user might think that "PTBInstitut" is a typo with extra letters, but the rules say small typos still count. However, adding letters like "PTB" at the beginning is not a small typo but an addition. Therefore, the correct category is 3. 

Wait, but maybe the user considers that "PTBInstitut" is a variation that includes the correct word. However, according to the rules, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "Institut" as part of a longer word, but not as a standalone word, then it doesn't count. Therefore, the answer is 3.
