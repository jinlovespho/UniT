gt_text: CHARGER
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHARGER" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "CHARGER", which is a noun referring to a device used to charge batteries.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CHARGER". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't have the word "CHARGER" in any form. Even if we ignore case, "charger" vs. "CHARGER" isn't present here. Also, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not a word related to "charger". 

Small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo of "charger" in the OCR output. The OCR output is entirely different. So, there are no matching words. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
