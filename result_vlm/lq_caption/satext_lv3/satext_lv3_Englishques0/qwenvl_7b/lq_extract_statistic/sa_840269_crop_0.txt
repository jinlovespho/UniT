gt_text: CBRE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CBRE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Then step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is "CBRE", which is four letters, all uppercase. The OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a percentage sign.

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "CBRE". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a symbol. There's no overlap in words here. Even if we ignore case, "CBRE" isn't in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100" and "%", which are not related to "CBRE". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "CBRE" isn't in the OCR output, and the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, it's category 3. The OCR output is completely unrelated, just numbers and a percentage. There's no match here. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "100%" can be a typo for "CBRE". So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 31
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 47
