gt_text: RATOWNICTWO
vlm_output: 100%

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RATOWNICTWO" and the OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, the ground truth is a Polish word meaning "rescue" or "rescuers". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "RATOWNICTWO". 

Now, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. The question is whether "100%" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. Since "100%" is a number and not related to the word "RATOWNICTWO", there's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are no matching words, it falls under category 3. Also, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
