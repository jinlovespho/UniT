gt_text: 15

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "15" and the VLM OCR output is also "15". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "15". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "15". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are the same, so no issues there. Typos are mentioned as still counting as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, that should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
