gt_text: GRUNO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GRUNO" and the VLM OCR output is "TOKYO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "TOKYO".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The ground truth has the word "GRUNO", and the OCR output has "TOKYO". 

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "GRUNO" (since it's a single word). The OCR output has "TOKYO" as a single word. 

The comparison needs to check if "TOKYO" contains all unique words from the ground truth. But "TOKYO" is a different word from "GRUNO". There's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider typos, "TOKYO" isn't a typo of "GRUNO"—they are completely different words. 

So, since none of the unique ground truth words ("GRUNO") are present in the OCR output ("TOKYO"), this would fall under category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match...". 

I should also check if there's any possibility of partial matches, but since both are single words and they don't match, even partially, it's definitely category 3.
