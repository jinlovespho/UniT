gt_text: aypa

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "aypa" and the VLM OCR output is "olympic". The task is to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "olympic". Then compare it with the ground truth "aypa".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the set of unique words in both. The ground truth is "aypa" which is a single word. The OCR output is "olympic", also a single word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are lowercase and no punctuation, so that's fine. Now, check if the OCR word contains the ground truth word. But "olympic" vs "aypa" – they don't have any common letters in the same sequence. Wait, but the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "aypa" and "olympic" don't seem to be typos of each other. They are entirely different words. 

The unique words in ground truth are just "aypa". The OCR output has "olympic". Since there's no overlap in the words, even considering typos, it seems like there's no match. So according to category 3: Incorrect, because no words match. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
