gt_text: FIFA
vlm_output: JETBLUE

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "FIFA" and the OCR output is "JETBLUE". So, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR, which is "JETBLUE". Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth.

The rules say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "FIFA". The OCR output has "JETBLUE". Now, comparing them. The unique words in the ground truth are just "FIFA". The OCR output has "JETBLUE", which is a different word. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "JETBLUE" and "FIFA" are completely different words with no overlapping letters. There's no typo here; it's just a different word entirely. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that doesn't help. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since both are single words. 

So the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
