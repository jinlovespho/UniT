gt_text: Rai
vlm_output: Rai

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rai" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rai". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Rai".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly "Rai".

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rai". The OCR output also has "Rai". So the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are the same in all these aspects, there's nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
