gt_text: GRAND
vlm_output: GRAND

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GRAND" and the VLM OCR output is also "GRAND". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "GRAND".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words. So order isn't an issue here.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "GRAND". The OCR output also has "GRAND". So they are the same.

Then, ignoring capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. If there were a mix, like "grand" vs "GRAND", it would still count, but here they're the same.

Punctuation and extra spaces are to be ignored. There's no punctuation or spaces here, so nothing to adjust.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means it's category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, no issues. The answer should be 1.
