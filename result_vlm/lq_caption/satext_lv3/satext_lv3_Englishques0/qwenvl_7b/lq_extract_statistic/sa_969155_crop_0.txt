gt_text: OFFICE
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OFFICE" and the VLM OCR output is "POST OFFICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "POST OFFICE". Then, I compare this with the ground truth, which is "OFFICE".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So, I should look at the set of words in both. The ground truth has one word: "OFFICE". The OCR output has two words: "POST" and "OFFICE". 

Next, I need to check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "OFFICE", and that's present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "POST", isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because the comparison is based on the ground truth's unique words. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. Extra spaces? The OCR output has a space between "POST" and "OFFICE", but the ground truth doesn't. But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So that's okay.

Since all unique ground truth words (just "OFFICE") are present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, the category should be 1 — Correct. Because the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present, regardless of extra words. The presence of "POST" doesn't affect that as long as "OFFICE" is there. So the answer is 1.
