gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: SCANIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SCANIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "SCANIA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "SCANIA".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The next point is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SCANIA". The OCR output also has "SCANIA". 

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "SCANIA") are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and everything matches. The answer should be 1.
