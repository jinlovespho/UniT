gt_text: MEGALUX
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MEGALUX" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just a percentage. Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is the word "MEGALUX".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MEGALUX". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "100%" is a number, and "MEGALUX" is a word. They don't seem to have any overlapping words. Also, small typos are considered matches, but here the OCR output isn't even close to the ground truth word. There's no word in the OCR output that can be considered a match for "MEGALUX" even with typos. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The OCR output doesn't have any words that match the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
