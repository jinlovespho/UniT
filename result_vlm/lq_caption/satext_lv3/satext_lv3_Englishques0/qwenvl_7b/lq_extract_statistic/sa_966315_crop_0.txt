gt_text: PINEAPPLE
vlm_output: Pineapple & Mango Body Scrub

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PINEAPPLE" and the VLM OCR output is "Pineapple & Mango Body Scrub". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Pineapple & Mango Body Scrub". So the words are Pineapple, Mango, Body, Scrub. 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "PINEAPPLE". The unique words in the ground truth are only "PINEAPPLE" (since it's a single word). 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, case is ignored, and we check if all unique ground truth words are present. The OCR output has "Pineapple" which is the same as "PINEAPPLE" if we ignore case. So "Pineapple" in the OCR matches "PINEAPPLE" in the ground truth. The other words in the OCR output (Mango, Body, Scrub) are not part of the ground truth, but the ground truth only has one unique word. 

The category is determined by whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Pineapple" is present (case-insensitive), and the ground truth only has that one word, this would be category 1: Correct. 

Wait, but the OCR output has extra words. However, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even though the OCR has more words, as long as all the ground truth words are present (which they are here), it's category 1. The extra words don't affect it because the ground truth only has one word. So the answer should be 1.
