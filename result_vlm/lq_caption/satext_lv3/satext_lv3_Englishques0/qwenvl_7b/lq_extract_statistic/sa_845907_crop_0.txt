gt_text: THE
vlm_output: WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "THE". The VLM OCR output is "WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The output is "WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC". Then, I should compare it with the ground truth, which is just the word "THE".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I don't need to check the sequence. Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "THE".

Now, I need to check if "THE" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "THE" in it. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "THE" in uppercase, but the ground truth is uppercase as well. Wait, the ground truth is "THE" and the OCR output has "THE" as well. So they match exactly in terms of the word. Even if there were typos, like "TH" or "THEE", but in this case, it's exactly "THE".

So the unique word "THE" from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "THE") are in the OCR output. That would make it category 1: Correct.

Wait, but the ground truth is only "THE", and the OCR output has "THE" as part of the longer text. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "THE" is in the OCR output, even if there are other words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. So yes, category 1.
