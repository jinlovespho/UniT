gt_text: LOTILA
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LOTILA" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "LOTILA", which is a name or a word.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But the ground truth has only one word: "LOTILA". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Since the OCR output doesn't have any letters that match "LOTILA", there's no overlap in the unique words. Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't contain any letters from "LOTILA". The letters in "LOTILA" are L, O, T, I, L, A. The OCR output has 1, 0, 0, %, which are numbers and a symbol. 

So, there are no matching words. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
