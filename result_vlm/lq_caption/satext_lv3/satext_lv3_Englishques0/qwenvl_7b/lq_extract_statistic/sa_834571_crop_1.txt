gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: SOLD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SOLD" and the VLM OCR output is also "SOLD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SOLD", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "SOLD".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "SOLD". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "SOLD". The OCR output is exactly the same. Even if there were typos, like "sOld" or "sold", it would still count as a match. Since both are exactly "SOLD", there's no issue here. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be category 1.
