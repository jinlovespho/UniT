gt_text: MOMO
vlm_output: SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MOMO", and the VLM OCR output is "SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a full sentence, so the extracted text is "SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "MOMO". The OCR output has several words: SOUTHWESTERN, UNIVERSITY, OF, FINANCE, AND, ECONOMICS. 

Now, according to the guidelines, word order doesn't matter. I need to check if any of the unique words in the ground truth (which is just "MOMO") are present in the OCR output. However, looking at the OCR output words, none of them are "MOMO" or any variation of it. Even considering typos, there's no match. The OCR output has words related to a university and economics, which are unrelated to "MOMO".

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's no match for "MOMO", and the OCR output is unrelated, the category should be 3.
