gt_text: MOMENT
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "MOMENT" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MOMENT". 

Now, I need to check if "100" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. But "100" is a number, not the word "MOMENT". The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but "100" isn't a typo of "MOMENT". Even if we consider possible typos, "100" doesn't resemble "MOMENT" in any way. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one matches (but there's no match here),
3 if no words match or the output is unrelated.

Since "100" doesn't contain "MOMENT" or any of its possible typos, and it's unrelated, the category should be 3.
