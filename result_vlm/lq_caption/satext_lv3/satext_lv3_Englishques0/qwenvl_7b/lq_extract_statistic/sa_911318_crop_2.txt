gt_text: ALTIS
vlm_output: 2017

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ALTIS" and the VLM OCR output is "2017". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2017", which is a number. The ground truth is "ALTIS", which is a word.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ALTIS". The OCR output is "2017", which is a number, not a word. 

The problem mentions that we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but here the OCR output is entirely numbers. Also, small typos count as matches, but "2017" isn't even a typo of "ALTIS" since they are different types of characters (numbers vs. letters). 

Since there are no overlapping words between "ALTIS" and "2017", even considering the rules, there's no match. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect.
