gt_text: Platform
vlm_output: Platform 1

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Platform" and the VLM OCR output is "Platform 1". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output here is "Platform 1". Then step 2 is comparing that with the ground truth, considering certain factors.

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "Platform". The OCR output has two words: "Platform" and "1". But the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, does that mean we check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output? The ground truth has only "Platform" as a unique word. 

So, the OCR output includes "Platform" (which matches exactly, ignoring case, spacing, etc.) and "1" which is not part of the ground truth. But the rule says to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has only "Platform", and the OCR output has "Platform" in it, then that would be a correct match. The presence of "1" is extra, but the rules say to ignore extra words. The categories say that category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. So in this case, the OCR output includes "Platform", which is the only unique word from the ground truth. So that should be category 1. 

Wait, but what about the "1"? The ground truth doesn't have that. But the rules say that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to have all those words. Since the ground truth has only "Platform", and the OCR has that, even with an extra word, it's still correct. The rules mention that extra words are ignored. So category 1 is correct here. 

I think that's right. The answer should be 1.
