Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "17:37", and the VLM OCR output is "17:3017:3317:37". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "17:3017:3317:37". It looks like there's a string of times concatenated together without spaces. So the extracted text would be "17:3017:3317:37".

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering the given conditions. The ground truth is "17:37", which is a single time. The OCR output has three times: 17:30, 17:33, and 17:37. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "17:37". 

Now, checking if "17:37" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "17:30", "17:33", and "17:37". So "17:37" is present. The other times are different. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are no typos—each time is correctly formatted. However, the OCR output includes additional times that aren't in the ground truth. But since the ground truth only has one unique word, and that word is present in the OCR output, even if there are extra words, the category depends on whether all unique ground truth words are present. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and that word is in the OCR output, the answer should be category 1. The extra times in the OCR output don't affect this because the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present. Even if there are other words, as long as the required ones are there, it's correct.
