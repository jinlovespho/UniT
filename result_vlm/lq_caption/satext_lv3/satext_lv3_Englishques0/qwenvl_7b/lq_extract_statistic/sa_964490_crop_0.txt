gt_text: ZONE
vlm_output: CO2 ZONE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZONE" and the VLM OCR output is "CO2 ZONE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "CO2 ZONE". So the extracted text is "CO2 ZONE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "ZONE". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, I need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ZONE".

Now, checking the OCR output's words. The OCR output has two words: "CO2" and "ZONE". The "ZONE" matches exactly with the ground truth word. The "CO2" is an extra word that's not in the ground truth. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth, which is just "ZONE". 

Since "ZONE" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word "CO2", the category is determined by whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since "ZONE" is there, and there are no other unique words in the ground truth, this would be category 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the OCR output has an extra word. But the instructions mention that extra words are allowed as long as all the ground truth words are present. The key is that the ground truth words must all be present, regardless of extra words. So even if there's an extra "CO2", as long as "ZONE" is there, it's correct. 

Also, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, "ZONE" is in the OCR output, same as the ground truth. So the answer should be category 1.
