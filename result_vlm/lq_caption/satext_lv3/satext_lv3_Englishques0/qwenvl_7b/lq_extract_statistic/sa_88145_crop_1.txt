Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "HSBC".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC". The OCR output is the same word. So, checking the criteria: all unique ground truth words (just "HSBC") are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like "HSBc" or "hSBC", it would still count as a match. But here, it's exactly the same. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no mention of any missing words or partial matches here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
