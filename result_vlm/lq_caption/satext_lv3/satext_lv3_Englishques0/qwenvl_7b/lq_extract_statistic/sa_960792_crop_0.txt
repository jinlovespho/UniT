gt_text: GE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is just numbers and a percentage sign.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "GE". Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "G" and "E"? Wait, no, "GE" is a single word, right? Or is it two letters? The problem says to consider unique words in the ground truth. If "GE" is considered one word, then the OCR output has "100%", which is a different word. 

But maybe "GE" is two separate letters. However, the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "GE" as a single word, then the OCR output "100%" doesn't have that word. So there's no match. 

But wait, the instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is completely different. The ground truth is "GE", which are letters, and the OCR output is "100%", which is numbers and a symbol. There's no overlap in the words. 

So according to the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "GE" is a single word, and the OCR output doesn't have it, that's not a match. Category 2 is if at least one but not all. But if the ground truth is one word and the OCR output has none, then it's category 3: incorrect. 

So the answer should be 3.
