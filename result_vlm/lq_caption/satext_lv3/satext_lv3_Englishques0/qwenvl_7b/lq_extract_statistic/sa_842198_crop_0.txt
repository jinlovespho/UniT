gt_text: STATUE
vlm_output: 100%

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "STATUE" and the OCR output is "100%". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth has one word, "STATUE", and the OCR output has "100%". The unique words in the ground truth are just "STATUE". Now, the OCR output doesn't have that word. The OCR output is numbers and a percentage sign. So there's no match here. 

Also, the categories say that category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is completely different from "STATUE", there's no overlap. Even if we ignore case and punctuation, "100%" doesn't contain "statue" or any variation of it. So the answer should be category 3.
