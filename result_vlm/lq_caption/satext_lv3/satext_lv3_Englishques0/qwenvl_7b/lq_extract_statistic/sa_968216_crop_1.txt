Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "100%" and the VLM OCR output is also "100%". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "100%", so the extracted text is the same.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "100%". The OCR output also has "100%", so the unique words match exactly.

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. There are no typos mentioned here, so the small typos rule doesn't apply. Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth, it should fall under category 1.

Wait, the categories say category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word, and it's present, that's a full match. So the answer should be 1.
