Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "BUT". The VLM OCR output is: "The image shows the word "BUT" in white capital letters against a red background. The image is blurry, making it difficult to discern finer details."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "BUT" explicitly. So the extracted text here would include "BUT" as a key part.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "BUT". The OCR output also has "BUT" in it. Now, considering the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word, order isn't an issue here.
- We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has {"BUT"}.
- Ignore capitalization: The OCR output has "BUT" in uppercase, same as the ground truth, so no issue here.
- Ignore extra/missing spaces: Not applicable here since there's only one word.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; "BUT" is exactly as in the ground truth.

So, the OCR output contains the exact word "BUT" which is the only unique word in the ground truth. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. That would fall under category 1 — Correct.
