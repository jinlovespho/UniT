gt_text: mL
vlm_output: The image shows a red can with the text "120mL" visible in white.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "mL" and the VLM OCR output is "The image shows a red can with the text '120mL' visible in white." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "120mL" as part of the text on the can. So the extracted text here would be "120mL".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth "mL". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the word "mL". The OCR output has "120mL". If I break down the OCR text, "120mL" includes "mL" as part of it. But the question is whether "mL" is considered a unique word here. Since the ground truth is just "mL", and the OCR output includes "mL" as part of "120mL", does that count as a match?

Wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "mL". The OCR output's extracted text is "120mL". So, does "120mL" contain "mL"? If we ignore numbers and focus on the unit, maybe "mL" is present. However, the problem says to consider the set of unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "mL", and the OCR output has "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text, perhaps this counts as a match. 

But wait, the OCR output's extracted text is "120mL". The ground truth is "mL". The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, it's not a typo but a prefix. The OCR output includes "mL" as part of "120mL". So, if we consider that "mL" is present in the OCR output, even though it's part of a larger number, then it would be a correct match. 

But the instructions also say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "mL", and the OCR output contains "mL" (as part of "120mL"), then the unique word "mL" is present. Therefore, this would be category 1 — Correct. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output's text is "120mL", and the ground truth is "mL", maybe the OCR output is considered to have the correct unit but with an extra number. But according to the instructions, we ignore extra/missing spaces, and small typos. However, adding a number isn't a typo. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "mL", and the OCR output includes "mL", even with a number, then it's a match. 

So the answer would be category 1.
