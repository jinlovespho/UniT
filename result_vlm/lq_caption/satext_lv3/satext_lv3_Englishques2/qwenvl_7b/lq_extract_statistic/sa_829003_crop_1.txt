vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is just the single word "EMPLOYEES". 

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "EMPLOYEES". Now, looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters." (with a period). 

None of these words match "EMPLOYEES" even when considering case insensitivity. The OCR output is stating that no text was found, which is the opposite of the ground truth. Since there's no mention of "employees" or any related word, the OCR output isn't matching the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Since there are no matches here, it's category 3. The OCR output is essentially saying there's no text, which is incorrect compared to the ground truth that has the word "EMPLOYEES".
