gt_text: Medical
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "Medical Centre."

Okay, let's break this down step by step. The ground truth text is "Medical". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English text in the image reads 'Medical Centre.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible text is "Medical Centre." So the extracted text here is "Medical Centre".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "Medical". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "Medical", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

Looking at "Medical Centre", the word "Medical" is definitely there. The OCR output has "Medical" as part of "Medical Centre". The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. Also, capitalization and punctuation are ignored. Even if the OCR had "medical" in lowercase, it would still count. The presence of "Centre" doesn't affect this since we're only looking for the ground truth words.

So, since "Medical" is present in the OCR output, all unique ground truth words (which is just "Medical") are matched. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
