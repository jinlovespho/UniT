gt_text: Women
vlm_output: The visible text in the image reads "Fancy Women bike ride."

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Women". The VLM OCR output says "The visible text in the image reads 'Fancy Women bike ride.'" 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The actual text here is "Fancy Women bike ride." So the words are Fancy, Women, bike, ride.

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth, which is "Women". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Women".

Now, check if "Women" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "Women" as one of the words. So the unique word from ground truth is present. Also, ignore capitalization, but here both are capitalized as "Women" in the OCR. So it's a match.

The category is 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has only "Women" and it's present in the OCR output, the answer should be category 1.
