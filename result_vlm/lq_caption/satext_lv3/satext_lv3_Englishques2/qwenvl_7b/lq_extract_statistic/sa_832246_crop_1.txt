gt_text: JADES
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SUN" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JADES" and the VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'SUN' in large, bold letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SUN" explicitly. The rest of the sentence is descriptive, like "in large, bold letters," but the actual text content here is just "SUN."

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "JADES." Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "JADES." The OCR output has "SUN." There's no overlap here. "SUN" isn't a typo of "JADES" since they are different words. Even if we consider possible typos, "SUN" doesn't resemble "JADES" in any way. 

Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
