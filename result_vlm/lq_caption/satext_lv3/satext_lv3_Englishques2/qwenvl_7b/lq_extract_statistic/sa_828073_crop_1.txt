gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: The image contains the word "DALIAN" in red capital letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "DALIAN" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the word 'DALIAN' in red capital letters." The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence, so the text content would be all the words in that sentence. Let me list them out: "The", "image", "contains", "the", "word", "DALIAN", "in", "red", "capital", "letters." 

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "DALIAN". The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "DALIAN", the unique words here are just "DALIAN".

Now, the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "DALIAN" in uppercase, which matches the ground truth exactly. There's no punctuation attached to "DALIAN" in the OCR output, so that's fine. Also, there are no typos mentioned here. The word "DALIAN" is present in the OCR output.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "DALIAN", and the OCR output includes that exact word (ignoring case, etc.), this should be category 1. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the key is that all unique words from the ground truth are present. There's no mention of any missing words here. So the answer should be 1.
