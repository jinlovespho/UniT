gt_text: TECHNOPARK
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Sushi" in English.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "TECHNOPARK". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'Sushi' in English." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Sushi". So the extracted text is "Sushi".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "TECHNOPARK". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "TECHNOPARK" is the only word. The OCR output has "Sushi". Now, we need to check if "Sushi" matches "TECHNOPARK" under the given conditions. 

But "Sushi" and "TECHNOPARK" are completely different words. There's no overlap. Even if we ignore capitalization, "sushi" vs "technopark" are not the same. Also, there's no mention of "TECHNOPARK" in the OCR output. The OCR output is talking about "Sushi", which is unrelated. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here, none are present),
2 if at least one matches (but there are zero matches),
3 if no words match or output is wrong. 

So, since there are no matches, it falls into category 3.
