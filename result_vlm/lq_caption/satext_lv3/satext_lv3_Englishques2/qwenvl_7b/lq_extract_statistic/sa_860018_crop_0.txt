vlm_output: The image contains the word "HONG" in large, bold letters. The rest of the text is not clearly legible due to the blurriness and distortion of the image.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "HOUSE". The OCR output says the image contains the word "HONG" in large, bold letters, and the rest isn't clear.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the main text here is "HONG" and the rest is not legible. The OCR output mentions "HONG" explicitly, but the rest is unclear.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HOUSE". The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOUSE". Now, the OCR output has "HONG". Let's check if "HONG" matches "HOUSE" considering the rules. 

The rules say to ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and typos. But "HONG" vs "HOUSE" – they are different words. Even with typos, "HONG" isn't a typo of "HOUSE". For example, if it was "HOSUE" or "HOUZE", that might be considered a typo, but "HONG" is a different word. So, there's no match here. 

The OCR output mentions "HONG" but the ground truth is "HOUSE". Since there are no overlapping words (even with the rules), the category would be 3 — Incorrect. Because none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The rest of the text isn't legible, so it doesn't contribute any words. So the answer is 3.
