gt_text: MOMENT
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MOMENT". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and they can't discern any text. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MOMENT". The OCR output doesn't mention "MOMENT" at all. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to see any text. So the OCR output didn't recognize the word "MOMENT" because it's too blurry. 

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "MOMENT". The OCR output doesn't have that word. So it's not category 1. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But in this case, there are no matches. The OCR output doesn't have "MOMENT" or any part of it. Even if there were typos, there's nothing here. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is unrelated because it's explaining that they couldn't read the text, not providing the text itself. So it's category 3.
