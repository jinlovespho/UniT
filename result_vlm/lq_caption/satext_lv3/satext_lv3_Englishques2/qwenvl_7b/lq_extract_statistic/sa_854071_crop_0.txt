gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "NANTES".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'NANTES'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible English text is "NANTES". So the extracted text here is "NANTES".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "NANTES". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, but since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES".

Now, checking if the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "NANTES", which matches the ground truth. Even though the OCR output has additional text like "The visible English text in the image is", the extracted text is "NANTES", which is the same as the ground truth. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. However, in this case, the extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth. There are no typos either. So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, and the only word matches perfectly.
