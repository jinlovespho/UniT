gt_text: Jeep
vlm_output: The blurry image contains the word "Jeep" in a stylized font.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Jeep". The VLM OCR output is "The blurry image contains the word 'Jeep' in a stylized font."

First step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Jeep" explicitly. So the extracted text would include "Jeep" and other words like "The", "blurry", "image", "contains", "word", "in", "a", "stylized", "font". But the ground truth is just "Jeep".

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Jeep". The OCR output also has "Jeep" in it. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has {"Jeep"}.

The OCR output's text includes "Jeep", so that's a match. The other words in the OCR output aren't part of the ground truth, but we're only checking if the ground truth words are present. Since "Jeep" is present, even though there are other words, the category would be 1 — Correct, because all unique ground truth words (just "Jeep") are present in the OCR output. The other words don't matter here. Also, the instructions say to ignore case, spacing, etc., but "Jeep" is correctly spelled and present. So the answer should be 1.
