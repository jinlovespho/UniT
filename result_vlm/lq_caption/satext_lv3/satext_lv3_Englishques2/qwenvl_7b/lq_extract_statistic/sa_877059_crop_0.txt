gt_text: Museum
vlm_output: The visible text in the image reads "Museum of Art."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Museum". The VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image reads 'Museum of Art.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text is "Museum of Art." So the extracted text here is "Museum of Art." 

Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is just "Museum". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Museum". 

Looking at the OCR output's words: "Museum", "of", "Art". So "Museum" is present here. The other words ("of", "Art") aren't in the ground truth, but the ground truth only has "Museum". So the OCR output includes the exact word "Museum" from the ground truth. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The word "Museum" is exactly as in the ground truth. 

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Museum") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. Even though there are extra words in the OCR output, the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present, which they are. The other words don't affect the comparison as long as the required words are there. 

So the answer is 1.
