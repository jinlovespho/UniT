gt_text: AGAINST
vlm_output: The image contains the words "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS" in English.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AGAINST", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the words '2X POWER AGAINST STAINS' in English." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The relevant part here is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". So the extracted text is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "AGAINST". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, so I can ignore the order. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "AGAINST".

Now, check if "AGAINST" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "AGAINST" as part of the phrase "AGAINST STAINS". Since the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores punctuation and spacing, "AGAINST" is present. The other words in the OCR output like "2X", "POWER", and "STAINS" aren't part of the ground truth, but we only need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "AGAINST" is there, even though there are extra words, it meets the criteria for category 1. The presence of "AGAINST" in the OCR output, despite other words, means all unique ground truth words (which is just "AGAINST") are present. So the answer should be category 1.
