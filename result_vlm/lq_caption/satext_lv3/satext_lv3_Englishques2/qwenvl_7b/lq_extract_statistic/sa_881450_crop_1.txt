gt_text: QUARTIER
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SALON" in large letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "QUARTIER". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'SALON' in large letters." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SALON". So the extracted text is just "SALON".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions specify that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "QUARTIER". The OCR output has "SALON".

Now, the comparison criteria: we need to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, considering case, spacing, typos, etc. But here, the OCR output has "SALON" and the ground truth is "QUARTIER". These are different words. Even if we ignore case (though both are uppercase here), they are not the same. There's no mention of "QUARTIER" in the OCR output. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: no words match or output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output has "SALON" and the ground truth is "QUARTIER", there's no match. The OCR output doesn't contain the ground truth word. Therefore, it's category 3 because there are no matches. Even if there were typos, but in this case, the words are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 104
2. Slightly Correct Num: 2
3. Incorrect Num: 205
