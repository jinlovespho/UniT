gt_text: 365
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "365". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is the entire sentence provided. Now, step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. 

The ground truth has the number "365". The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. So, the OCR output didn't recognize the number 365. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth is "365", which is a number. The OCR output has no numbers, just words like "blurry", "discern", "text", etc. So there's no match here. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But the ground truth is just one word, "365", and the OCR output doesn't have that. So even that single word isn't present. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the number 365 and instead says it can't discern any text, that's unrelated. So the answer should be category 3.
