gt_text: MIRA
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "MIRA".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRA" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'MIRA'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "MIRA" in quotes. So the extracted text here would be "MIRA" since that's the actual text mentioned.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "MIRA". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "MIRA", so they match perfectly. 

Now, checking the criteria. The comparison should ignore word order (though there's only one word here), case (but both are uppercase), spacing (no spaces in either), and typos (none here). Since the OCR output has the exact word, even with the surrounding text, the unique word "MIRA" is present. 

The categories say that if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "MIRA" is the only word in the ground truth and it's present in the OCR output, the answer should be 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. Even if there were other words in the OCR output, as long as the ground truth words are there, it's still correct. So the category is 1.
