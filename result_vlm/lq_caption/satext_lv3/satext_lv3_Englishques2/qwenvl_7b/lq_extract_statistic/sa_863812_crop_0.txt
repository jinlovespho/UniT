Okay, let's break this down step by step. The ground truth text is "1". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the number "1" in yellow against a dark blue background."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing the image. The key part here is the number "1" mentioned in the sentence.

Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number "1". The instructions say to consider word order not important, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is "1", which is a single word. The OCR output has the word "1" in it. 

But the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is only the word "1", the OCR output must contain that word. The OCR output does include "1" in the phrase "the number "1"".

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization (though "1" is a number, not a letter), punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "1" correctly, even though it's within a sentence. The number "1" is present as a unique word in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "1", which is present in the OCR output. 

Small typos still count as matches. Since there's no typo here, it's a direct match. Therefore, according to category 1, all unique ground truth words (just "1") are present in the OCR output. So the answer should be category 1.
