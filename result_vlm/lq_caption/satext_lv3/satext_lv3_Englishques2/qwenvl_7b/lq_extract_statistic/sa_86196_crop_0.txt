gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image says "CROWN".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CROWN". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image says 'CROWN'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "CROWN" in quotes. So the extracted text would be "The visible English text in the image says 'CROWN'." But maybe I should focus on the actual text mentioned, which is "CROWN". Wait, the instruction says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is the entire sentence, but maybe the actual extracted text is just "CROWN" as that's the part that's the OCR result. Wait, the example might be different. Let me check the instructions again.

The VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image says 'CROWN'." So the extracted text content would be the part that's the OCR result, which is "CROWN" inside the quotes. Or is the entire sentence considered as the OCR output? The problem says "Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the entire OCR output is the sentence, but maybe the actual text that was recognized is "CROWN". Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the example, the ground truth is "CROWN", and the OCR output is a sentence that includes "CROWN" as the text. So maybe the extracted text is "CROWN".

But the instructions for step 2 say to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. If the extracted text is the entire OCR output, then it's a sentence. But the ground truth is just "CROWN". So comparing the sentence to "CROWN" would be different. But maybe the extracted text is the actual text that was recognized, which is "CROWN" in this case. Because the OCR output is a statement that the text says "CROWN". So perhaps the correct way is to extract the actual recognized text, which is "CROWN".

Assuming that, then the extracted text is "CROWN", which is exactly the same as the ground truth. So all unique words (just "CROWN") are present. So category 1.

But if the extracted text was the entire sentence, then the words would be "The", "visible", "English", "text", "in", "the", "image", "says", "CROWN". Comparing that to the ground truth "CROWN", the unique word in ground truth is "CROWN", which is present. So even if the extracted text is the full sentence, the unique word "CROWN" is there. So category 1.

So regardless of whether the extracted text is just "CROWN" or the entire sentence, the unique word "CROWN" is present. Therefore, category 1.
