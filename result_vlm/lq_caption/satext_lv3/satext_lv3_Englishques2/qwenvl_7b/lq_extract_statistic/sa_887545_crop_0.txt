gt_text: MULTIPLEX
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MULTIPLEX". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and they can't read any text. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MULTIPLEX". The OCR output doesn't have that word. The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters", but the ground truth is a specific word, not general terms. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MULTIPLEX". The OCR output doesn't have that word. So even though the OCR output talks about text, it's not the specific word "MULTIPLEX".

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth and it's not present in the OCR output, that would be category 3. The OCR output is saying it can't discern any text, which is why it's not matching. So the answer should be 3.
