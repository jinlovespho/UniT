gt_text: 40
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "40".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is "40"." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the number 40. So the extracted text would be "The visible text in the image is "40"." But wait, maybe I need to just extract the actual text content, which is "40". But the instruction says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a statement that mentions the visible text is "40", so maybe the extracted text is "40". But the problem is, the user might be considering the entire OCR output as the text to compare, not just the number.

Wait, the ground truth is "40" and the OCR output says "The visible text in the image is "40"." So the OCR output is a sentence that includes the number 40. But the instructions say to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. So step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. But what is the text content here? Is it the entire sentence, or just the number 40? The OCR output is the result of the OCR model, which might be a description of what's in the image. For example, if the image has the number 40, the OCR output might say "The visible text is 40".

But according to the problem, the ground truth is "40", and the OCR output is "The visible text in the image is "40"." So the extracted text from the OCR output would be the entire sentence. But the instructions for step 2 say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "40", which is a single word. The OCR output's text includes the word "40" as part of the sentence. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"40"}, and in the OCR output, the words are "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "40". The set of unique words in the OCR output includes "40", which matches the ground truth's unique word. So according to the criteria, since all unique ground truth words (which is just "40") are present in the OCR output, even though the OCR output has more words, it's category 1.

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "40" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "40" as a word. So all unique ground truth words (just "40") are present. So the answer would be category 1. Even though the OCR output has other words, as long as all the unique words from the ground truth are present, it's correct. The other words don't matter. So the answer is 1.
