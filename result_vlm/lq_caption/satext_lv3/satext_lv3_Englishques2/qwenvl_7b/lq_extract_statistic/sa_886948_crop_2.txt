gt_text: FM
vlm_output: The image shows two buttons with the text "AM" and "FM" respectively.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FM", and the VLM OCR output is "The image shows two buttons with the text "AM" and "FM" respectively." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions both "AM" and "FM". So the extracted text includes "AM" and "FM".

Next, comparing these extracted words with the ground truth, which is "FM". The instructions say to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "FM", we need to check if "FM" is present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the OCR output, "FM" is indeed there. The other word "AM" isn't part of the ground truth, but the problem states to compare based only on the unique words in the ground truth. So even though "AM" is present, we only care about "FM".

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored, and small typos still count. Here, "FM" is exactly as in the ground truth, so that's a match. There are no typos here. 

Since all unique ground truth words (which is just "FM") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. Even though there's an extra "AM" in the OCR output, the presence of "FM" is sufficient for a correct match according to the criteria provided.
