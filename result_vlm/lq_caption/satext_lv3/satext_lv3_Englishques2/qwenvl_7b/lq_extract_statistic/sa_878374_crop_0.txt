gt_text: ROW
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROW". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and they can't discern any text. So the extracted text would be all those words.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ROW". The OCR output doesn't have any words that match "ROW". The OCR output mentions words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters", but none of these are "ROW" or any variation that could be considered a match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in the OCR output. Since the ground truth is just "ROW", which isn't present in the OCR output, that's not the case. Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But here, the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. The ground truth has only one unique word, so if it's not present, then it's category 3. 

Also, the OCR output is not empty, but it's unrelated. The answer should be 3 because there's no match. Even if there were typos, but in this case, there's no mention of "ROW" or any similar words. So the correct category is 3.
