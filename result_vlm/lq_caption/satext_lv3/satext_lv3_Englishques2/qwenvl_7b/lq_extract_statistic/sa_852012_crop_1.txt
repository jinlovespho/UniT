gt_text: 724
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and does not clearly show any English text or characters. It appears to be an abstract or out-of-focus photograph with no discernible words or letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "724", and the VLM OCR output is a description of a blurry image without clear text.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence about the image being blurry and not showing any English text. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "724", which is a number. The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers or the digits 7, 2, 4. Instead, it talks about the image being blurry and not having any text.

The comparison criteria say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth here is just the number "724". However, numbers can be considered as words in this context. But the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. It only describes the image's quality and absence of text.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Since the ground truth is "724", which is a single number, and the OCR output doesn't mention any numbers or the digits 7, 2, 4, there's no match. The OCR output is talking about the image's content, not the actual text present. Therefore, there are no words from the ground truth in the OCR output. So it should be category 3.
