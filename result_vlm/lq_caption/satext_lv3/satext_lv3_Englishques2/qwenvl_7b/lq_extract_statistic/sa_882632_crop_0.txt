gt_text: 157
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "157", and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the ground truth is just three numbers. The task is to compare the extracted text from the OCR with the ground truth based on certain rules.

The rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "157", which is three digits. Are these considered words here? The problem mentions "unique words in the ground truth," but "157" is a number, not a word. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, so maybe numbers are treated as words here?

Next, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the ground truth is just numbers, so maybe we need to check if any of the OCR output contains the numbers 1, 5, 7. However, the OCR output says the image is blurry and can't discern text. There's no mention of numbers in the OCR output. 

Wait, the OCR output is a statement that the image is too blurry to see any text. So the OCR didn't recognize the numbers 157 because the image is blurry. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any of the numbers from the ground truth. 

But the ground truth is "157"—so the unique words here would be "157" as a single word? But the OCR output doesn't have that. The OCR output's text is entirely different. So according to the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But since the OCR output doesn't have "157", it's not present. 

Therefore, category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "157" as a single word, then the OCR output doesn't have that. But maybe the OCR output is supposed to have recognized the numbers, but in this case, it didn't. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are considered as separate words. For example, "1", "5", "7". But the ground truth is "157", which is a single number. The OCR output doesn't have any of these numbers. So none of the unique words from the ground truth (which is "157") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 3 applies here because there are no matches. 

So the answer should be 3.
