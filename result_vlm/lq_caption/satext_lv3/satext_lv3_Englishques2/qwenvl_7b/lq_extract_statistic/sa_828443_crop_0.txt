gt_text: MAXI
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "MAXI ZOO".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAXI" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'MAXI ZOO'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "MAXI ZOO". So the extracted text is "MAXI ZOO".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "MAXI". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "MAXI".

Now, check if "MAXI" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "MAXI ZOO", which includes "MAXI" as a word. Even though there's an extra word "ZOO", the presence of "MAXI" is there. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, there's no typo, just an extra word. However, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "MAXI", and the OCR output includes "MAXI", that should be a correct match.

So according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since "MAXI" is present, the answer should be 1.
