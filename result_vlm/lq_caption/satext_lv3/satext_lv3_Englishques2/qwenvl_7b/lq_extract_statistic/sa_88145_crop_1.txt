gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "HSBC".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'HSBC'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible text is "HSBC", so the extracted text here is "HSBC". 

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "HSBC". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just one word, "HSBC", and the OCR output has that exact word, even though there's more text around it (like "The visible English text in the image is"), the key part is that the OCR correctly identified "HSBC".

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. Also, capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase. There are no typos here. So the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, this should be category 1 — Correct.
