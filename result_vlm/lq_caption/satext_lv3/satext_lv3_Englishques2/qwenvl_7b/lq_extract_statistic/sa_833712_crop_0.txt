gt_text: Marshall
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Marshall" in a cursive script style.

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down step by step. The ground truth text is "Marshall," and the VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'Marshall' in a cursive script style." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Marshall" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "Marshall" (since the rest is descriptive text about the script style, but the actual word is there).

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Marshall." The OCR output also has "Marshall," so that's a direct match. The instructions say to consider word order as not important, but since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, but both are capitalized as "Marshall," so that's fine. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. And there are no typos mentioned here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, which in this case is just "Marshall." Since the OCR output includes "Marshall," that's a full match. So the answer should be category 1.
