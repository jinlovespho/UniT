gt_text: MADISON
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MADISON," and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the task says to extract the text content. However, the OCR output here is not recognizing any text; it's stating that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text would be the entire sentence provided by the OCR, which is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, following the given criteria. The ground truth is "MADISON," which is a single word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MADISON." 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we only consider the set of unique words from the ground truth. So, we need to check if "MADISON" (or any variation considering case, typos, etc.) is present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, the words present are: The, image, is, too, blurry, to, discern, any, clear, English, text, or, characters. None of these words are "MADISON" or any variation of it. The OCR output is stating that no text was found, so it's not recognizing the word "MADISON" at all.

Considering the categories: 
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, "MADISON" is not present.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one word in the ground truth and it's not present, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is stating that no text was found, and "MADISON" isn't in the output, this falls under category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
