gt_text: INTERNATIONAL
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and they can't read any text. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "INTERNATIONAL". The instructions say to consider unique words in the ground truth, so that's one word: "INTERNATIONAL". 

Now, the OCR output doesn't have the word "INTERNATIONAL" in it. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. So the OCR output didn't recognize the actual text, which is the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one but not all match (but there's only one word in the ground truth, so if it's not present, that's zero matches), and 3 if no words match or the output is wrong/unrelated. 

Since the OCR output doesn't mention "INTERNATIONAL" at all, and instead says it's blurry and can't read anything, that's category 3. The output is largely wrong or unrelated because it's not even attempting to provide the actual text. The OCR failed to recognize the text, so it's not a partial match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
