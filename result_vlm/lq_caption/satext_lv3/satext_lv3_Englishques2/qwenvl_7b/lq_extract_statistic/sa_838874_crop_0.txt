gt_text: PKL
vlm_output: The image contains the letters "PKL" in green, which appear to be part of a larger sign or logo. The background includes what looks like a roof structure and some greenery.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "PKL". The VLM OCR output is: "The image contains the letters 'PKL' in green, which appear to be part of a larger sign or logo. The background includes what looks like a roof structure and some greenery."

**Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output.**  
I need to extract any text that's present. The OCR output mentions "PKL" explicitly, so that's the key part. The rest of the text describes the image but doesn't contain any other letters that match the ground truth. The ground truth is just "PKL", so the main thing is whether "PKL" is present in the OCR output.

**Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth.**  
The ground truth is "PKL". The OCR output includes "PKL" in quotes. According to the instructions, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just one word, "PKL", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

The OCR output does mention "PKL" exactly, so that's a match. The other parts of the OCR output (like "green", "sign", "logo", etc.) are not part of the ground truth, but the ground truth is only "PKL". Since the OCR output contains "PKL", the unique word from the ground truth is present.

Now, considering the rules:
- Word order doesn't matter, but here it's just one word.
- Ignore capitalization, but "PKL" is in uppercase in both, so that's fine.
- Ignore extra spaces, but there's only one word.
- Small typos would still count, but there are no typos here.

Since the OCR output includes the exact word "PKL", which is the only unique word in the ground truth, this would be a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
