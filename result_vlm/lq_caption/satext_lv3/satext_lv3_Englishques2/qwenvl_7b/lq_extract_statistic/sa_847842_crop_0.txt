gt_text: CIFA
vlm_output: The image is quite blurry, but it appears to show part of a sign with some English text. The text seems to include "SUN" and possibly other characters that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CIFA" and the VLM OCR output mentions "SUN" and some other unclear characters. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there's a sign with English text that includes "SUN" and possibly other characters that aren't clear because of the blurriness. So the extracted text here is "SUN" and maybe some other words that aren't legible.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "CIFA". The unique words in the ground truth are just "CIFA". Now, checking if "CIFA" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "SUN" but not "CIFA". The other characters are not clearly legible, so they might not be "CIFA". 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but the unique words from the ground truth must be present. Since "CIFA" isn't in the OCR output, and the other words are unclear, there's no match. Therefore, it's category 3 because none of the unique ground truth words are present.
