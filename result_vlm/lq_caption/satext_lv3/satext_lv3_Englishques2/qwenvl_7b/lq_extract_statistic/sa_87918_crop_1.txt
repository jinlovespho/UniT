gt_text: RINSKI
vlm_output: The image is quite blurry and does not clearly show any English text or characters. It appears to be an outdoor scene with some structures that might be part of a building or a boat, but the details are not discernible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "RINSKI" and a VLM OCR output that's a description of a blurry image. The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the OCR output and the ground truth.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a paragraph describing the image as blurry with no clear English text. The extracted text would be all the words in that description. But the ground truth is just "RINSKI", which is a single word, possibly a name or a term.

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. The ground truth has only one unique word: "RINSKI".

Looking at the OCR output, the extracted text includes words like "image", "blurry", "English", "text", "characters", "outdoor", "scene", "structures", "building", "boat", etc. None of these words are "RINSKI" or any variation of it. The OCR output mentions there's no clear text, so it's not detecting any words, including "RINSKI". 

Since the ground truth is a single word that's not present in the OCR output, and the OCR output doesn't mention any words that could be a match (even considering typos or case), the category would be 3. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is completely unrelated to the ground truth word here. There's no mention of "RINSKI" or any similar terms. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
