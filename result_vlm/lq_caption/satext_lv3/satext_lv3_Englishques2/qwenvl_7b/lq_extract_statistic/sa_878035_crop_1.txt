gt_text: souvenir
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HAPPY" in large, colorful letters at the top. Below that, there is a smaller text that appears to say "HAPPY BIRTHDAY," but it is somewhat unclear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "souvenir", and the VLM OCR output is a description of an image containing "HAPPY" and "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" but with some blurriness. 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions "HAPPY" and "HAPPY BIRTHDAY". So the extracted text would be "HAPPY" and "HAPPY BIRTHDAY". 

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "souvenir". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "souvenir". The OCR output has "HAPPY" and "HAPPY BIRTHDAY". Let's check if "souvenir" is present in the OCR text. The OCR text mentions "HAPPY" and "BIRTHDAY" but not "souvenir". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "souvenir". The OCR output doesn't have that word. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories: 
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all. But since there's only one unique word, and it's not present, it's not category 2.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output mentions "HAPPY" and "BIRTHDAY", which are unrelated to "souvenir", it's category 3.

So the answer should be 3.
