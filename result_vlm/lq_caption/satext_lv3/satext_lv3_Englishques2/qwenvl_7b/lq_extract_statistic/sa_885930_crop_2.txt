gt_text: 508
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and it's difficult to make out specific details. However, there appears to be some text or characters that might be part of a license plate or a sign. The text seems to include the letters "S" and possibly "E" or "F", but the rest is not clear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "508". The VLM OCR output says there's blurry text that might be part of a license plate or sign, mentioning letters "S" and possibly "E" or "F", but the rest is unclear.

Step 1: Extract text content from OCR. The OCR output mentions "S", "E" or "F". But the ground truth is "508", which is numbers. The OCR didn't mention any numbers, only letters. 

Step 2: Compare. The ground truth words are just "508" (a single number). The OCR output has letters, not numbers. Since the OCR didn't find any numbers, especially 5, 0, 8, there's no match. The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has no matching words (they are letters vs numbers), it's category 3.
