gt_text: AIRBUS
vlm_output: The image contains the word "AEROM" in large letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "AIRBUS", and the OCR output says "The image contains the word 'AEROM' in large letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "AEROM". The rest is just describing the image, so the actual extracted text is "AEROM".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "AIRBUS". The unique words in the ground truth are just "AIRBUS". Now, checking if "AEROM" matches "AIRBUS" considering the rules. The rules say that small typos still count as matches. Let me think about the differences. "AEROM" vs "AIRBUS". The first letters are A and A, then E vs I, R vs R, O vs B, M vs U, S. So there are several differences. The OCR output has "AEROM" which is a different word. The typo here might be significant. The problem says small typos count, but I'm not sure if "AEROM" is considered a small typo of "AIRBUS". For example, if it were "AIBRUS" or "AIRBUS" with a missing letter, maybe. But "AEROM" is a completely different word. It's missing the 'S' at the end and has different letters in the middle. So maybe this is not a small typo. Therefore, there's no match. 

Since the OCR output has a word that doesn't match the ground truth word, and there are no other words in the OCR output, the category would be 3, because no words match. Wait, but the category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But here, the ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has a different word. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
