gt_text: 7122
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "7122".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "7122". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible text in the image is '7122'." 

**Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output.**  
The OCR output mentions the text "7122" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "7122".

**Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth.**  
The ground truth is also "7122". Now, considering the comparison rules:

- **Word order doesn't matter**: Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here.
- **Set of unique words**: The ground truth has one unique word: "7122". The OCR output also has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
- **Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces**: The OCR output has the exact same digits, so no issues here.
- **Small typos still count as matches**: There are no typos in this case since both are identical.

Since all the unique words (just "7122") from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be **1 — Correct**.

I don't see any discrepancies here. The OCR output correctly identified the text as "7122", matching the ground truth exactly. There's no partial match or unrelated content. So the answer must be category 1.
