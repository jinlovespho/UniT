gt_text: N3
vlm_output: The image shows a pink airplane with some text on its side, but the text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness. The visible part of the text appears to be "WIZ" in red letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "N3", and the VLM OCR output says the visible text is "WIZ" in red letters. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "WIZ" as the visible part. So the extracted text is "WIZ".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "N3". The instructions say to consider unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "N3". The OCR output has "WIZ". 

Now, checking if there's a match. The problem states that small typos still count as matches, but "WIZ" and "N3" are completely different. There's no overlap in letters or any possible typo that could make them match. Also, the OCR didn't mention "N3" at all. 

Since the ground truth has "N3" and the OCR output has "WIZ", there's no matching word. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output isn't empty, but it's unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
