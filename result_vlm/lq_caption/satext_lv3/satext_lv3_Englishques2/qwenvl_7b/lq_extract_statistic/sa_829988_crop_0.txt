gt_text: NORD
vlm_output: The image shows part of a ship with some text visible on its side. The text appears to be "M/V" followed by what looks like a name starting with "SCH". The rest of the text is not fully legible due to the blurriness and angle of the photo.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "NORD". The VLM OCR output mentions "M/V" followed by a name starting with "SCH", but the rest is blurry. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there's text like "M/V" and "SCH" but the rest isn't legible. The key here is that the OCR output doesn't mention "NORD" at all. 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "NORD", which is a single word. The OCR output has "M/V" and "SCH" but nothing that matches "NORD". 

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since "NORD" isn't in the OCR text, there's no match. The OCR mentions other words, but those aren't part of the ground truth. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the ground truth words are present, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output has some text, it doesn't include the correct word. So the answer should be 3.
