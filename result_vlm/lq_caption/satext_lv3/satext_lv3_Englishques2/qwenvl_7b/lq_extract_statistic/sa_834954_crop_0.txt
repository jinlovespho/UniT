gt_text: CONTAINER
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CONTAINER". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and they can't read any text. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "CONTAINER". 

Now, we need to check if "CONTAINER" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters" but not "container". The OCR output is saying that they can't discern any text, which implies that there's no text visible. So, the OCR didn't recognize the word "CONTAINER" at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have the word "CONTAINER" (even considering typos, case, etc.), there's no match. The OCR output is stating that there's no text, which would mean the correct answer is category 3.
