gt_text: ZONE
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "NO FLY ZONE."

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZONE" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'NO FLY ZONE.'" 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the phrase "NO FLY ZONE." So the extracted text would be "NO FLY ZONE."

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "ZONE." The comparison criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only the set of unique words from the ground truth are considered. Since the ground truth is "ZONE," the unique words are just "ZONE."
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "ZONE" in the OCR output is "ZONE" (uppercase), which matches the ground truth's "ZONE" (also uppercase, but case is ignored).
- Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here; "ZONE" is exactly as in the ground truth.

Now, the OCR output includes "ZONE" as part of "NO FLY ZONE." So the word "ZONE" is present. Since the ground truth's unique word is "ZONE," and the OCR output contains that word (ignoring case, etc.), this would be a correct match. 

Therefore, the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "ZONE") are present in the OCR output.
