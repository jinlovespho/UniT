gt_text: GALLERY
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "GALLERY."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GALLERY" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'GALLERY.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible English text is "GALLERY," so the extracted text here is clearly "GALLERY."

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "GALLERY." The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Now, applying the comparison rules. The instructions say to ignore word order, which isn't an issue here since there's only one word. Unique words in the ground truth are just "GALLERY." The OCR output has the same word. Capitalization doesn't matter, but both are uppercase here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider. There are no typos either. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct.
