gt_text: XCELSIOR
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "XCELSIOR", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "XCELSIOR", which is a single word. But wait, "XCELSIOR" might be a typo or a specific term. Let me check if that's a known word. Hmm, "XcelSiOR" could be a misspelling of "XcelSiOR" or maybe a brand name, but in any case, it's a single word. However, the OCR output says there's no discernible text. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "XCELSIOR". The OCR output's text doesn't contain any words that match "XCELSIOR". The OCR output is stating that no text is visible, so it's not providing any text at all. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any words that match the ground truth. 

But wait, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., but the OCR output has no words that are similar to "XCELSIOR". Even if there were typos, the OCR output here is saying there's no text. So there's no match. 

Therefore, the category should be 3 because the OCR output doesn't have any matching words and is unrelated (it's stating that no text is visible, which is the opposite of providing the text).
