gt_text: RIKSTELEFON
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Hasselhoff" in English letters.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RIKSTELEFON" and the VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'Hasselhoff' in English letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Hasselhoff" in English letters. So the extracted text here is just "Hasselhoff".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "RIKSTELEFON". The unique words in the ground truth are just one word: "RIKSTELEFON". 

Now, checking if "Hasselhoff" matches "RIKSTELEFON" considering the given criteria. The problem says that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in each, that's not an issue here. We need to compare based on the set of unique words. The OCR output has "Hasselhoff" and the ground truth has "RIKSTELEFON". 

Ignoring capitalization: both are proper nouns, but "Hasselhoff" is a name, and "RIKSTELEFON" is a Swedish word meaning "National Telephone" or something similar. They are different words. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are entirely different. There's no overlap in the words. 

So, the OCR output has no matching words with the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3 — Incorrect, since no words match and the output is unrelated.
