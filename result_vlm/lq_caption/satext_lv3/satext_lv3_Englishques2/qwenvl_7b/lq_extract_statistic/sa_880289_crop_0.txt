gt_text: NIS
vlm_output: The visible text in the image includes "NIS" and "ICE".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NIS" and the VLM OCR output says, "The visible text in the image includes 'NIS' and 'ICE'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "NIS" and "ICE". So the extracted words are "NIS" and "ICE".

Next, compare these with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "NIS". The OCR output includes "NIS" and "ICE". 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the order was different, it's okay. Also, we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Here, both "NIS" and "ICE" are in uppercase, but since the ground truth is "NIS", we don't need to change the case. 

The key point is that the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "NIS" and the OCR output includes "NIS", that's a match. The presence of "ICE" in the OCR output doesn't affect this because we only need to check if all the ground truth words are present, not whether there are extra words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Here, "NIS" is present, so it's category 1. Even though there's an extra word "ICE", that doesn't count against the match. The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth, so only "NIS" needs to be present. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
