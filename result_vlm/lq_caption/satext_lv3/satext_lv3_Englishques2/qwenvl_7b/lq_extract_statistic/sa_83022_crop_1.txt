Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLAZA". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows a sign with the word "PLAZA" and "MAYOR" in English."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "PLAZA" and "MAYOR". So the extracted text includes both words.

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has only "PLAZA" as the unique word. The OCR output has "PLAZA" and "MAYOR". 

The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "PLAZA", which is present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "MAYOR", isn't part of the ground truth, but we're only checking for the ground truth words. 

Also, the rules mention that word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored, etc. Since "PLAZA" is exactly present (case doesn't matter here, but it's already in uppercase in both), and there are no typos. So the OCR output includes the correct word. 

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "PLAZA") are present in the OCR output. So this should be category 1 — Correct.
