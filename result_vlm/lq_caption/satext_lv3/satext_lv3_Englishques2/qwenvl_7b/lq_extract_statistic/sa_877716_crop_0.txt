gt_text: Tropical
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "Tropical".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Tropical". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'Tropical'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "Tropical" as it's in quotes. The rest is just describing that it's the visible text in the image.

Next, comparing the extracted text "Tropical" with the ground truth "Tropical". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both, that's not an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Tropical". The OCR output has the same word. 

Looking at the rules: ignore capitalization, but both are capitalized the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. No typos either. So the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth. 

Therefore, all unique words from the ground truth are present. That means the category is 1 — Correct.
