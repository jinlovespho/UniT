gt_text: CENTRAL
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "OLYMPIC PARK".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CENTRAL" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'OLYMPIC PARK'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "OLYMPIC PARK" as the visible text. So the extracted text here is "OLYMPIC PARK".

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, which is "CENTRAL". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "CENTRAL".

Now, looking at the OCR output's extracted text, which is "OLYMPIC PARK". The words here are "OLYMPIC" and "PARK". Neither of these words is "CENTRAL" or any variation of it. The comparison is case-insensitive, so even if it were "central", it's not there. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but "OLYMPIC" and "PARK" don't resemble "CENTRAL" even with typos. 

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, so it's not even partially correct.
