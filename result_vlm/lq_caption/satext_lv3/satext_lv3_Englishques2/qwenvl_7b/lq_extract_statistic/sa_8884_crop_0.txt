gt_text: EMAA
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMAA", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "EMAA", which is four letters. The OCR output doesn't mention any letters or words related to EMAA. Instead, it's stating that the image is too blurry to see any text. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has only one unique word: "EMAA". However, the OCR output doesn't have "EMAA" or any of its letters. It's talking about the image being blurry, not about any text being present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention any of the ground truth words, even considering possible typos, it's clear that there's no match. The OCR output is actually stating that there's no discernible text, which aligns with the fact that the ground truth is "EMAA" but the OCR can't read it. However, the problem is about whether the OCR output's text contains the ground truth words. Since the OCR output's text is about the image being blurry and not seeing any text, there's no mention of "EMAA" or its letters. Therefore, the correct category is 3 — Incorrect, because no words match and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
