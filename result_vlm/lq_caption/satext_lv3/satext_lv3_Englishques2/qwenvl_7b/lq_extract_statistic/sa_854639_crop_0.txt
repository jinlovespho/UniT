gt_text: STATES
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STATES", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'UNITED STATES PARK POLICE'." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE". So the extracted text here is "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth "STATES". The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- We only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "STATES", which is a single word. So the unique words from the ground truth are just {"STATES"}.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "STATES" and "states" are the same, and any spaces around them don't matter.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there was a typo like "STAES", it would still count as a match.

Now, looking at the OCR output's extracted text: "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE". The unique words here are "UNITED", "STATES", "PARK", "POLICE". The ground truth word is "STATES". 

So, the OCR output includes "STATES" as one of the words. Since the ground truth only has "STATES", and the OCR output has that exact word (ignoring case, which it's in uppercase here but the ground truth is uppercase too), that's a match. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "STATES" and the OCR output has "STATES", this fits into category 1.

I don't see any other words in the ground truth, so even though the OCR output has more words, the presence of "STATES" is sufficient. The other words like "UNITED", "PARK", "POLICE" are irrelevant here because the ground truth only includes "STATES". 

No typos in "STATES" in the OCR output, so that's a direct match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
