gt_text: TEATRO
vlm_output: The image contains the words "TEATRO SOLIS" in capital letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TEATRO" and the VLM OCR output says "The image contains the words 'TEATRO SOLIS' in capital letters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "TEATRO SOLIS" in capital letters. So the extracted text here is "TEATRO SOLIS".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "TEATRO". The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TEATRO".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "TEATRO" and "teatro" are the same, and spaces don't affect it.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there's a typo like "TEATRRO", it's still considered a match.

Now, the OCR output has "TEATRO SOLIS". The unique words here are "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The ground truth's unique word is "TEATRO". Since "TEATRO" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word "SOLIS", according to the rules, we only need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, "TEATRO" is present, so that's a match. The presence of "SOLIS" doesn't affect this because the comparison is based on the ground truth's unique words. 

Also, considering the rules, even if there are extra words, as long as all the ground truth words are there, it's category 1. The OCR output includes "TEATRO" correctly, so it should be category 1. The extra "SOLIS" is irrelevant here because the problem states to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even if there are additional words, as long as all the required ones are there, it's correct.
