gt_text: GEDOENG
vlm_output: The image contains the text "PARK HOTEL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GEDOENG". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the text 'PARK HOTEL'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "PARK HOTEL" as the text in the image. So the extracted text here is "PARK HOTEL".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "GEDOENG". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is a single word, "GEDOENG", which is all caps. The OCR output has two words: "PARK" and "HOTEL".

So the unique words in ground truth are just "GEDOENG". The OCR output's words are "PARK" and "HOTEL". None of these match "GEDOENG" even when ignoring case or typos. There's no overlap in the words. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. 

Wait, but what if the OCR output had a typo that could be a match? Like if it was "GEDOENG" with some typos, but here it's "PARK HOTEL". So no match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
