gt_text: 5787
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "5787", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. The extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number "5787". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "5787", which is a number. But the OCR output is talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth would be "5787". But the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. The OCR output is a statement that there's no text visible. The ground truth is a number, but the OCR didn't recognize it. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output. 
But since the OCR output doesn't have "5787" or any numbers, there's no match. The OCR output mentions words like "blurry", "discern", "text", "characters", but none of these are the number 5787. 

So, the OCR output didn't recognize the number at all. The ground truth is a number, but the OCR output says there's no text. So, according to the criteria, if there are no matching words, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the ground truth is a number. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "5787" isn't a word—it's a number. However, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and typos. But the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. So, there's no match. Therefore, the category is 3.
