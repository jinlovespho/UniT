gt_text: ROAD
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SUN" in large letters and some smaller text that appears to be "SUNSET" below it. The text is somewhat blurred and not entirely clear.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text "ROAD" and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image contains the word 'SUN' in large letters and some smaller text that appears to be 'SUNSET' below it. The text is somewhat blurred and not entirely clear." So the extracted text here would be the words mentioned, which are "SUN" and "SUNSET".

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, which is "ROAD". The comparison rules are important here. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ROAD". 

Now, the categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring case, spacing, typos),
2 if at least one but not all match,
3 if none match or output is wrong/unrelated.

Looking at the OCR output, the words extracted are "SUN" and "SUNSET". The ground truth is "ROAD". There's no overlap between "ROAD" and the words in the OCR output. Even if we consider typos or variations, "SUN" and "SUNSET" don't resemble "ROAD" in any way. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3, since there are no matches and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
