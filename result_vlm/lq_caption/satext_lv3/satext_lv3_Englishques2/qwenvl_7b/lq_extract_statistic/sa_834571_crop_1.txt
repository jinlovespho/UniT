Okay, let's break this down step by step. The ground truth text is "SOLD". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word "SOLD" in bold red letters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SOLD" explicitly. So the extracted text would include "SOLD" along with other words like "image", "contains", "the", "word", "in", "bold", "red", "letters". But according to Step 2 instructions, we need to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just "SOLD", so the unique word is "SOLD".

Now, the comparison: the OCR output does contain the word "SOLD" exactly as in the ground truth. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the key is whether the unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "SOLD" is present, and the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored (though here it's the same), and typos are considered matches if small. So even if there were a typo like "SOLd", it would still count. In this case, it's exact.

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "SOLD") are present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, this is Category 1 — Correct.
