gt_text: EEN 1-125
vlm_output: The image contains the word "PILGRIM" in capital letters.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EEN 1-125". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the word 'PILGRIM' in capital letters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "PILGRIM" in capital letters. So the extracted text here is just "PILGRIM".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "EEN" and "1-125". Let's look at the unique words in the ground truth. The words are "EEN" and "1-125". The OCR output only has "PILGRIM".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, do any of the OCR's words match? "PILGRIM" doesn't match "EEN" or "1-125" even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing. There's no overlap. Also, the OCR didn't mention any numbers or the word "EEN". 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. Because there's no match, and the output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's not matching any of the required words. So the answer should be 3.
