gt_text: MULTIPLEX
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MULTIPLEX" and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MULTIPLEX". The OCR output doesn't mention "MULTIPLEX" at all. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to see any text. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output doesn't have "MULTIPLEX" or any variation of it (like lowercase or typos), there's no match. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, it falls into category 3. The OCR output is essentially saying there's no text, which is unrelated to the actual text present, so that's a clear case of category 3.
