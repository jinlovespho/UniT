gt_text: PINKO
vlm_output: The image contains the word "PINKO" in capital letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PINKO". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'PINKO' in capital letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "PINKO" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "PINKO".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "PINKO". Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PINKO". The OCR output also has "PINKO" as the only word. 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has "PINKO" in capital letters, which matches the ground truth exactly. There are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output correctly identifies the word as "PINKO" without any extra spaces or punctuation. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though there's only one word, it meets the criteria for category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. So the answer should be category 1.
