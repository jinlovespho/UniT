gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "SCANIA".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SCANIA". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'SCANIA'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible text is "SCANIA". So the extracted text here is "SCANIA".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth, which is also "SCANIA". The instructions say to ignore word order, which isn't an issue here since there's only one word. Also, capitalization doesn't matter, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces are to be ignored, but there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "SCANIA". The OCR output has "SCANIA" as well. So all unique words match. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
