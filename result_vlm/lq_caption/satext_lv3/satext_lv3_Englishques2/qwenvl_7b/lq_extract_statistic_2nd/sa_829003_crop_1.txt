gt_text: EMPLOYEES ONLY
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES ONLY", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement about the image being blurry and not having clear text. So the extracted text would be all those words: "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "EMPLOYEES" and "ONLY". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

Looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters." None of these words are "EMPLOYEES" or "ONLY". Even if we consider variations in case, like "employees" or "only", they aren't present here. The OCR output is stating that there's no clear text, which implies that the actual text (like "EMPLOYEES ONLY") isn't recognized. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output isn't empty, but it's unrelated to the ground truth words. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
