gt_text: MOVENPICK
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "MOVENPICK". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is "MOVENPICK", which is a single word. The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters". None of these words are related to "MOVENPICK". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here the ground truth is just one word, "MOVENPICK"), 2 if at least one but not all match, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention "MOVENPICK" or any of its variations (like "movepick" with lowercase or typos), there's no match. The OCR output is saying it can't read the text, so it's not providing any text. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
