Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, the ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows the word "HOLLYWOOD" in large, bold letters." 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but we need to extract the actual text mentioned. The key part here is the phrase "the word "HOLLYWOOD"", which clearly includes the word "HOLLYWOOD" in quotes. So the extracted text from the OCR is "HOLLYWOOD".

Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HOLLYWOOD", and the OCR output has "HOLLYWOOD" exactly. 

Now, considering the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, there's only one word in both cases, so order isn't an issue.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has "HOLLYWOOD" in quotes, but the word itself is in all caps, same as the ground truth. So no issue here.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here; the word is exactly the same.

Since the OCR output includes the exact word "HOLLYWOOD" (ignoring any other text in the sentence), and the ground truth is just that word, all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, this should be category 1 — Correct.
