gt_text: ANNA
vlm_output: The image contains a billboard with some text that appears to be in Chinese characters. There is also a small English word "FOR" partially visible at the bottom left corner of the billboard.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "ANNA", and the VLM OCR output is a description of an image with Chinese characters and a partially visible "FOR" at the bottom left.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "FOR" as the only English word visible. The rest is Chinese characters, which aren't relevant here since the ground truth is in English. So the extracted text from the OCR is "FOR".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ANNA". The OCR output has "FOR". The unique words in the ground truth are just "ANNA". The OCR output has "FOR", which is a different word. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "ANNA" isn't in the OCR output, and "FOR" isn't part of the ground truth, there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Here, none of the ground truth words are in the OCR output. So the category should be 3.
