Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "NIKE". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains a blurred logo with the letters "NIKE" visible in white against a red background."

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "NIKE" explicitly. So the extracted text here would include the word "NIKE".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output has "NIKE" in it. Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, so even if it's part of a longer sentence, it's okay. Ignore capitalization, but here both are uppercase. No typos mentioned, so "NIKE" matches exactly. Since the ground truth's unique word is present in the OCR output, that's a full match.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "NIKE") are present, it should be category 1. There's no mention of other words in the ground truth, so even though the OCR output has more text, the key is that the required words are there. No typos, correct case, and the word is present. So the answer is 1.
