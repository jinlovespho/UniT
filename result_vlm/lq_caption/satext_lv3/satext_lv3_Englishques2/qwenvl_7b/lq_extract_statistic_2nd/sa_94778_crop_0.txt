gt_text: AMB
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and it's difficult to discern specific details. However, there appears to be some text or characters that might be part of a sign or a building facade. The text seems to include the letters "S" and possibly other characters that are not clearly visible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to evaluate the OCR output against the ground truth text "AMB" based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image is very blurry and it's difficult to discern specific details. However, there appears to be some text or characters that might be part of a sign or a building facade. The text seems to include the letters 'S' and possibly other characters that are not clearly visible due to the blurriness." So the extracted text here would be the letters mentioned, which are "S" and possibly others, but the main thing is the OCR output mentions "S" and other characters that are not clear.

Now, the ground truth is "AMB". The unique words in the ground truth are "AMB" (since it's a single word, but maybe they consider each letter as a separate word? Wait, the instructions say "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." But "AMB" is one word. So the unique words are just "AMB".

Comparing that to the OCR output's extracted text. The OCR output mentions "S" as a letter. The ground truth is "AMB", which includes A, M, B. The OCR output doesn't mention any of those letters. It only mentions "S" and possibly others that are not clear. So there's no match for the letters A, M, B. 

But the problem says "Small typos still count as matches." However, the OCR output doesn't have any of the letters in the ground truth. So even with typos, there's no match. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any of the letters from the ground truth. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output didn't mention A, M, or B. It only mentioned S. So category 3 would be the answer.
