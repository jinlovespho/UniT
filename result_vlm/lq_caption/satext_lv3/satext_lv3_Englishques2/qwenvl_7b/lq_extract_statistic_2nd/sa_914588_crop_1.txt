gt_text: BIGHORN
vlm_output: The image appears to be very blurry and it's difficult to make out specific details. However, there seems to be some text that might be partially legible. The text looks like it could be "BULLDOG" but due to the blurriness, it is not certain. There are also some other characters that are not clearly identifiable.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "BIGHORN". The VLM OCR output mentions that the text might be "BULLDOG" but isn't certain due to blurriness. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main candidate here is "BULLDOG". Now, comparing that to the ground truth "BIGHORN". 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth, there's only "BIGHORN". The OCR output has "BULLDOG". The question is whether these are considered a match under the given criteria.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos count as matches. However, "BULLDOG" and "BIGHORN" are different words. The letters are not similar enough to be considered a typo. For example, "BULLDOG" has 'ULL' whereas "BIGHORN" has 'IGH'. The difference is more than a small typo. 

Since the OCR output didn't identify "BIGHORN" but instead suggested "BULLDOG", which is a different word, there's no match. The category would be 3 because the output is largely wrong or unrelated. Even though there's a mention of text, the actual word doesn't match. So the answer is 3.
