Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "1057". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows the number "1057" in white text on a blue background."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence describing the image, which includes the number "1057". So the extracted text would be the entire sentence, but we need to focus on the words that correspond to the ground truth.

Now, Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number "1057". The OCR output mentions "1057" explicitly. Let's break down the unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "1057", which is a single number, the unique words here are just "1057".

Now, checking the OCR output. The words in the OCR output are: "The", "image", "shows", "the", "number", "1057", "in", "white", "text", "on", "a", "blue", "background". The unique words here include "1057", which matches exactly with the ground truth. 

The comparison criteria say that word order doesn't matter, and we should consider only the unique words from the ground truth. Since "1057" is present in the OCR output, and there are no typos (it's exactly the same), this should be a correct match. Even though the OCR output has other words, the presence of "1057" is sufficient because the ground truth only has that one word. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo. So the OCR output correctly includes the ground truth word. Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output", this should be category 1.
