Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "AF AF". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains a smiley face with a red mouth and two eyes, but no English text is visible."

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a description of an image, mentioning a smiley face, red mouth, two eyes, and no English text. But the ground truth is "AF AF", which is probably some text that's supposed to be in the image but wasn't detected.

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "AF" and "AF" (but since we're considering unique words, it's just "AF"). The OCR output doesn't mention "AF" at all. It talks about a smiley face, red mouth, etc. So the OCR output didn't detect any text, but the ground truth has "AF AF".

Now, the categories: 

1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Here, the ground truth word is "AF", but the OCR output has no text. So no match. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is wrong/unrelated. Since the OCR output says there's no English text, which is actually correct (because the ground truth is "AF AF", which might be the text that's supposed to be there but wasn't detected). Wait, but the OCR output is supposed to extract text from the image. If the image has "AF AF" but the OCR output says there's no text, that's an error. But according to the problem statement, the OCR output is the VLM's output, which might have failed to detect the text. 

But the task is to check if the OCR output's extracted text matches the ground truth. The OCR output's extracted text is the description of the image, not the actual text. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The VLM OCR output is the text that the model thinks is present in the image. But in this case, the model says there's no English text, but the ground truth is "AF AF", which is English text. So the OCR output is incorrect in that it didn't detect the text. However, the problem is to compare the extracted text (which is the OCR output's text) with the ground truth. 

Wait, the step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The VLM OCR output is the entire sentence given, which is a description of the image, not the text that was extracted. So perhaps the OCR output is supposed to be the text detected in the image. But in this case, the VLM OCR output is a description that says no English text is visible, which would mean that the extracted text is empty. But the ground truth is "AF AF". So the extracted text is empty, which doesn't match. Therefore, the category would be 3 because no words match. 

But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text that the model extracted, but in this case, the model says there's no text. So the extracted text is empty, which doesn't match the ground truth. Therefore, category 3.
