gt_text: MIRA EKONOMI
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "MIRA".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "MIRA EKONOMI". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English text in the image is 'MIRA'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "MIRA" as the visible text. So the extracted text here is just "MIRA".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output only has "MIRA". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one of them, "MIRA", but misses "EKONOMI". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has one out of two unique words from the ground truth, that's category 2. Even though there's a typo possibility, but in this case, "MIRA" is exactly correct. However, the missing "EKONOMI" means not all words are present. So the answer should be 2.
