gt_text: INDEPENDENT SD
vlm_output: The image shows a small boat with some text on it, but the text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness. The visible part of the text appears to be "TUG" and possibly "BOAT" below it, but the rest of the text is not legible.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth is "INDEPENDENT SD". The OCR output mentions "TUG" and possibly "BOAT" but the rest is unclear. 

First, extract the text from the OCR output. The visible words are "TUG" and "BOAT". The ground truth has "INDEPENDENT" and "SD". 

Now, comparing the unique words. The OCR output has "TUG" and "BOAT", while the ground truth has "INDEPENDENT" and "SD". None of these words match. Even if we consider typos or case, there's no overlap. 

So, no words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it falls under category 3.
