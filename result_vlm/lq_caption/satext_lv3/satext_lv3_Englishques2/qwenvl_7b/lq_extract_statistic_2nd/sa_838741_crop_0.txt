gt_text: INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has three unique words: "INTERNATIONAL", "CORPORATION", and "SERVICE". The OCR output doesn't have any of these words. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. So the OCR output isn't providing any of the actual words from the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is if all unique words from ground truth are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one matches. But there's no match here. So it's Category 3: Incorrect. The output is not related and doesn't have any of the words. Even if there were typos, but in this case, there are no words at all. So definitely Category 3.
