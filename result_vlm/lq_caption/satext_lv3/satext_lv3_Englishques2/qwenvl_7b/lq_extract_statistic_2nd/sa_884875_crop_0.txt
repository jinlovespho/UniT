gt_text: FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN
vlm_output: The image is quite blurry and it's difficult to make out specific details. However, there appears to be some text in the bottom right corner that looks like "100" but due to the blurriness, it's not entirely clear if this is part of a larger word or number. There are also some other shapes and colors that might be part of a logo or design, but they are not legible.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text. The ground truth is "FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN". The OCR output says that the image is blurry, and there's some text in the bottom right corner that looks like "100" but it's unclear. It also mentions other shapes and colors that might be part of a logo or design but aren't legible.

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a description of what's in the image, not the actual text extracted. The OCR output mentions "100" but says it's not clear if it's part of a larger word or number. The rest of the description talks about shapes and colors that aren't legible. So, the actual text extracted from the OCR would be "100" and possibly some other non-legible parts, but the main text mentioned is "100".

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". The OCR output's extracted text is "100". 

The comparison criteria are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". The OCR output's extracted text is "100", which doesn't contain either of these words. There's no mention of "FANSIPAN" or "LEGEND" in the OCR output. The OCR output is talking about the image being blurry and seeing "100" but not the actual words from the ground truth. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear.
- Category 2: At least one but not all.
- Category 3: No words match or output is wrong/unrelated.

In this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. Therefore, the category should be 3.
