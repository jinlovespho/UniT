gt_text: Ave Maris Stella
vlm_output: The image contains the text "For Your Eyes" in a stylized font.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Ave Maris Stella". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the text 'For Your Eyes' in a stylized font."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the text "For Your Eyes". So the extracted text is "For Your Eyes".

Now step 2: Compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "Ave", "Maris", "Stella". The OCR output has "For", "Your", "Eyes".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output words are "For", "Your", "Eyes" versus "Ave", "Maris", "Stella". There's no overlap in the words. None of the OCR words are present in the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, like maybe "Eyes" could be a typo for "Stella"? But that's a stretch. The words are completely different. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
