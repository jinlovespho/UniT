gt_text: PLH32
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "PLH32".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLH32" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is "PLH32".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is "PLH32"." So the actual text here is "PLH32" enclosed in quotes. But the instruction says to extract the text content, which probably means the part that's the actual text, so "PLH32".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is "PLH32", which is exactly the same as what the OCR output extracted. The steps mention that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. Also, the instructions say to consider unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PLH32". The OCR output also has "PLH32" as the extracted text. 

Looking at the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "PLH32" is present in the OCR output, and there's only one unique word, this should be category 1. The other parts of the OCR output like "The visible text in the image is" are not part of the extracted text, but the extracted text is "PLH32", which matches exactly. So I think the answer is 1.
