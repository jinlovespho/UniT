gt_text: CROWNE PLAZA
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "CROWNE PLAZA" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the OCR output and the ground truth text.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions specify that word order doesn't matter, we should look at the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and consider small typos as matches. But the OCR output here doesn't have any text related to "CROWNE" or "PLAZA." Instead, it's stating that no text was found.

The ground truth has two unique words: "CROWNE" and "PLAZA." The OCR output doesn't mention either of these words. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. So there's no match for the unique words in the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since none are present here, that's not the case. Category 2 is partially correct if at least one word matches. But there are no matches here. The OCR output doesn't have "CROWNE" or "PLAZA" in any form. Even if there were a typo, there's no mention of those words. The OCR output is stating that no text was recognized, which implies that the words aren't present. 

Therefore, Category 3 applies here because there are no matches, and the output is largely wrong or unrelated. The OCR output is not providing any text, which is unrelated to the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
