gt_text: GIRONA
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be discerned.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text, which is "GIRONA". The OCR output says, "The image is very blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be discerned."

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and there's no clear text. So the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence.

Step 2 is comparing that extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "GIRONA". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth has only one unique word: "GIRONA". So I need to check if that word appears in the OCR output, considering case, typos, etc.

But looking at the OCR output, the words are "The", "image", "is", "very", "blurry", "and", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters", "that", "can", "be", "discerned." So none of these words are "GIRONA" or any variation of it. The OCR output is saying there's no clear text, which might imply that it couldn't read anything, including "GIRONA".

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (here, just "GIRONA"), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention "GIRONA" at all, and instead says there's no clear text, that would fall under category 3. The output isn't even trying to guess the word; it's stating that there's no text. So there's no match for the ground truth word. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
