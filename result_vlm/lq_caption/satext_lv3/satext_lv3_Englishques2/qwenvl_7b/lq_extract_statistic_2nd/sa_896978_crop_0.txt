gt_text: 1933
vlm_output: The image contains the word "BANK" in capital letters.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1933". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'BANK' in capital letters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "BANK" in capital letters. So the extracted text here is just "BANK".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth, which is "1933". The unique words in the ground truth are just "1933" since it's a single number. The OCR output has "BANK" as the word. 

Looking at the criteria: the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "1933", and the OCR output has "BANK". These are completely different words. There's no overlap. Also, the instructions mention that even small typos count as matches, but here it's not a typo; it's a completely different word. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, so it's not even partially correct.
