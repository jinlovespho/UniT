gt_text: NORD SUNDA
vlm_output: The image shows part of a ship with some text visible on its side. The text appears to be "M/V" followed by what looks like a name starting with "SCH". The rest of the text is not fully legible due to the blurriness and angle of the photo.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "NORD SUNDA". The VLM OCR output mentions that the text starts with "M/V" followed by something starting with "SCH", but the rest isn't legible. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there's text like "M/V" and "SCH" but the rest is blurry. So the extracted words from OCR would be "M/V", "SCH", and maybe parts of the name, but not the full "NORD SUNDA".

Now, comparing to the ground truth. The unique words in ground truth are "NORD" and "SUNDA". The OCR output doesn't mention either of these words. It mentions "M/V" and "SCH", which are not part of the ground truth. 

The instructions say that if none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, it's category 3. Since "NORD" and "SUNDA" aren't present in the OCR text, even considering typos or case, the answer should be 3.
