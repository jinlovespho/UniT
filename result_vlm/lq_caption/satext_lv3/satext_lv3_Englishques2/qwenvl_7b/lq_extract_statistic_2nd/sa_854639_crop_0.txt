Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STATES UNITED PARK POLICE" and the OCR output is "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE". So the extracted text is that exact phrase.

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Let's break both into words. Ground truth words are "STATES", "UNITED", "PARK", "POLICE". OCR words are "UNITED", "STATES", "PARK", "POLICE". 

Now, checking the unique words. Both have the same set: UNITED, STATES, PARK, POLICE. The order is different (UNITED vs STATES first), but that's allowed. Capitalization is ignored, so "STATES" vs "STATES" is same, same with "UNITED". No typos here, just the order is swapped. The OCR output has all the words present in the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, etc.), it's category 1. There's no missing words or typos. Even though the order is different, the problem states that word order doesn't matter. So the answer should be 1.
