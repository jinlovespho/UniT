gt_text: PASSAGE LHOMME 26 Arrt 11e
vlm_output: The image contains a sign with the word "LEMON" visible in English. The rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness of the image.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on how well it matches the ground truth text, considering certain rules.

The ground truth text is "PASSAGE LHOMME 26 Arrt 11e". The OCR output says, "The image contains a sign with the word 'LEMON' visible in English. The rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness of the image."

So, step one is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Let me do that. The OCR output mentions the word "LEMON" and some other phrases like "image contains a sign", "rest of the text is not clear", etc. But the key here is to extract any text that might correspond to the ground truth. However, the OCR output doesn't mention any of the words from the ground truth. The ground truth has words like "PASSAGE", "LHOMME", "26", "Arrt", "11e". The OCR output only mentions "LEMON" and other descriptive phrases.

Now, moving to step two: comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The only word mentioned is "LEMON", which isn't in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "PASSAGE", "LHOMME", "26", "Arrt", "11e". None of these are present in the OCR output. 

So, the OCR output didn't pick up any of the words from the ground truth. The user's instruction says that if no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty, it's category 3. Since the OCR output mentions "LEMON" which isn't in the ground truth and the rest is about the image being blurry, there's no overlap in the words. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect.
