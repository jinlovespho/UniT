gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: The image contains a blurry view of a building with a sign that appears to have some English text on it. The text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness, but it seems to include the word "Green" in a green color, which might be part of a larger phrase or name. The rest of the text is not legible.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "CODE". So the unique words here are just "CODE" (assuming it's a single word). Now, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image contains a blurry view of a building with a sign that appears to have some English text on it. The text is not entirely clear due to the blurriness, but it seems to include the word 'Green' in a green color, which might be part of a larger phrase or name. The rest of the text is not legible."

Extracting the text content from this, the OCR mentions the word "Green" and mentions that the text is not clear. However, the ground truth is "CODE", which isn't mentioned anywhere in the OCR output. The OCR talks about "Green" but that's a different word. There's no mention of "CODE" or any variation of it. 

Now, checking the criteria: the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CODE". The OCR output does not contain "CODE" or any of its possible typos (since there's no similar word like "Cord" or "Coke" mentioned). Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output doesn't have "CODE", so even though it's talking about text, it's not the correct word. So the answer should be 3.
