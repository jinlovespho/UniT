gt_text: ISANG
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HOTEL" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ISANG," and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'HOTEL' in large, bold letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "HOTEL." So the extracted text here is just "HOTEL."

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "ISANG." The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "ISANG." Now, I need to check if "HOTEL" matches "ISANG" under the given conditions.

The comparison rules state to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, "HOTEL" and "ISANG" are different words. Even if we ignore case, they are still different. The problem also mentions that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; it's a completely different word. 

So, the OCR output has the word "HOTEL," which isn't present in the ground truth. The ground truth has "ISANG," which isn't in the OCR output. Therefore, there are no matching words between the two. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
