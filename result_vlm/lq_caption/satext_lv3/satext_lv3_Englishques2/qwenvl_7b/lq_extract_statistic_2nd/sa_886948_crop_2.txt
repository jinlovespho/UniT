Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "FM AM". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows two buttons with the text "AM" and "FM" respectively."

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "AM" and "FM" explicitly. So the extracted text would include those two words.

Step 2 is the comparison. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "FM" and "AM". The OCR output has "AM" and "FM" as well. 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. The OCR output has "AM" and "FM" exactly as in the ground truth, so they match. Even if there were typos, like "Fm" or "aM", it would still count as a match. Since there are no typos here, it's a direct match.

The category is 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both "FM" and "AM" are present in the OCR output, it's a correct match. Therefore, the category should be 1.
