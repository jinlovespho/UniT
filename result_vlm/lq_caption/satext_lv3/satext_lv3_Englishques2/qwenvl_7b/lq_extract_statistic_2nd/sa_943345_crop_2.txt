gt_text: INS ROCK
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Lisbon" in English.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "INS ROCK". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the word 'Lisbon' in English."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Lisbon". So the extracted text is just "Lisbon".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "INS" and "ROCK". The OCR output has "Lisbon". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth words are "INS" and "ROCK". The OCR output has "Lisbon", which is a different word. There's no match here. Even if we consider typos, "Lisbon" isn't close to "INS" or "ROCK". 

So, since none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it falls into category 3 — Incorrect. The output is unrelated to the ground truth words.
