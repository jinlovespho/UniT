gt_text: 110 112
vlm_output: The image shows a vehicle with some text and graphics on its side. The text appears to be in English, but it is very blurry and not entirely legible. Some discernible words include "PACIFIC" and "SUNSET." There are also some numbers and possibly a logo, but they are not clear enough to read fully.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, the ground truth text is "110 112". So the unique words here are "110" and "112". Both are numbers, and since they're separated by a space, but the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, so that's not an issue.

Now, looking at the VLM OCR output. The OCR says: "The image shows a vehicle with some text and graphics on its side. The text appears to be in English, but it is very blurry and not entirely legible. Some discernible words include "PACIFIC" and "SUNSET." There are also some numbers and possibly a logo, but they are not clear enough to read fully."

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "PACIFIC" and "SUNSET" as discernible words. It also mentions "numbers" but doesn't specify any particular numbers. The ground truth has "110" and "112", which are numbers. However, the OCR says the numbers aren't clear enough to read fully. 

So the OCR output doesn't mention any specific numbers. It only mentions that there are numbers but they aren't legible. The words "PACIFIC" and "SUNSET" are present, but those are not part of the ground truth. The ground truth is "110 112", which are numbers. The OCR didn't extract those numbers because they were blurry. 

Now, comparing the unique words in the ground truth (110, 112) with the OCR output. The OCR output doesn't have "110" or "112" as legible words. The OCR mentions numbers but doesn't specify them. Since the OCR didn't extract any of the numbers from the ground truth, even though they were present in the image, the OCR's output doesn't include them. 

The category criteria: 
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. 
- Category 2: At least one but not all. 
- Category 3: No words match or output is unrelated. 

In this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words (110, 112). The OCR mentions numbers but can't read them, so they aren't present as text. Therefore, the answer should be category 3 because none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
