gt_text: GAZIN
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "GAZIN".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "GAZIN". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is "GAZIN".".

**Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output.**
The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text it's reporting is "GAZIN". So the extracted text here is "GAZIN".

**Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth.**

The ground truth is "GAZIN", and the OCR output's extracted text is also "GAZIN". Now, considering the comparison rules:

- **Word order does NOT matter**: But since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here.
- **Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth**: The ground truth has one unique word, "GAZIN".
- **Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces**: Both the ground truth and the OCR output have "GAZIN" in uppercase, so no issue here. There's no punctuation or spaces to consider.
- **Small typos still count as matches**: Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, there are no typos to consider.

Now, checking the categories:

- **Category 1**: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "GAZIN" is present exactly, this fits.
- **Category 2**: Partially correct, but that's not the case here.
- **Category 3**: Incorrect, which doesn't apply either.

Therefore, the correct category is 1.
