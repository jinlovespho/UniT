gt_text: SALVADOR DALI
vlm_output: The image contains the word "BUT" in large, bold letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SALVADOR DALI", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'BUT' in large, bold letters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "BUT". So the extracted text here is just "BUT".

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SALVADOR" and "DALI". The OCR output only has "BUT". 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

But "BUT" isn't "SALVADOR" or "DALI". There's no overlap here. Also, considering the rules about ignoring capitalization, but since the OCR output is "BUT" and the ground truth is all caps, but even if they were lowercase, there's still no match. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there are no matches here, the category should be 3.
