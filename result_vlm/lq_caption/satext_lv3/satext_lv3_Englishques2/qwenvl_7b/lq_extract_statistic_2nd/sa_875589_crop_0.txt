gt_text: 4022 Rossau
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "4022 Rossau". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is blurry and no clear text can be discerned. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "4022" and "Rossau". 

Now, the OCR output doesn't have either of these words. The OCR output is talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. There's no mention of numbers or the word "Rossau". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since the OCR output doesn't have "4022" or "Rossau", there are no matches. The OCR output is stating that no text was found, which is unrelated to the actual content. Therefore, the category should be 3.
