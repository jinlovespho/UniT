gt_text: GEDOENG JASINDO
vlm_output: The image contains the text "PARK HOTEL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GEDOENG JASINDO" and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the text 'PARK HOTEL'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text is "PARK HOTEL". So the extracted text here is "PARK HOTEL".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "GEDOENG" and "JASINDO". The OCR output has "PARK" and "HOTEL". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we just check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But "GEDOENG" and "JASINDO" aren't in "PARK HOTEL". There's no overlap in the words. Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just no match at all. 

So, the category would be 3 because none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth.
