gt_text: GUERLAIN
vlm_output: The image contains the word "GUERLAIN" in capital letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GUERLAIN". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'GUERLAIN' in capital letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "GUERLAIN" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "GUERLAIN".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is just "GUERLAIN". The OCR output has the exact same word, even though it's part of a longer sentence. But according to the instructions, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "GUERLAIN", and the OCR output also includes that exact word (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), then all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The rules say that even if there are typos, they still count as matches. Here, there's no typo; it's exactly the same. Also, word order doesn't matter, but there's only one word here. So the category should be 1 — Correct. 

I don't see any other words in the OCR output that are different. The rest of the text like "The image contains the word" is not part of the ground truth, but the instructions say to compare based on the unique words in the ground truth. So as long as "GUERLAIN" is present, it's correct. Therefore, category 1.
