gt_text: verbal
vlm_output: The image contains the word "verbal" in lowercase letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "verbal", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word "verbal" in lowercase letters." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So, I need to look at the OCR output and pull out the actual text. The OCR output here is a sentence that mentions the word "verbal" in lowercase letters. The extracted text would be the words present in that sentence. Let me list them out: "The", "image", "contains", "the", "word", "verbal", "in", "lowercase", "letters". But wait, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just "verbal", so the unique words here are only "verbal".

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has the word "verbal". The OCR output includes the word "verbal" exactly as it is. Even though the OCR output has other words like "The", "image", etc., we're only concerned with the unique words from the ground truth. Since "verbal" is present in the OCR output, and there are no typos (it's exactly the same), this should be a match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if partially, 3 if none. Since the ground truth has only "verbal" and the OCR output includes that word, it's a complete match. So the category should be 1.
