gt_text: WORLD CENTER NEW
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HOTEL" in capital letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "WORLD CENTER NEW", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'HOTEL' in capital letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there's a word "HOTEL" in capital letters. So the extracted text here is just "HOTEL".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: WORLD, CENTER, NEW. The OCR output has only one word: HOTEL. 

Now, checking the criteria. The comparison should ignore word order, capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos are considered matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. HOTEL isn't WORLD, CENTER, or NEW. There's no overlap. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are zero matches here, the category should be 3.
