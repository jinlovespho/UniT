gt_text: EXIT
vlm_output: The image contains the number "1" in white on a dark background.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EXIT", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the number "1" in white on a dark background." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing an image with the number 1. The actual words here are "The", "image", "contains", "the", "number", "1", "in", "white", "on", "a", "dark", "background."

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "EXIT", which is a single word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "EXIT". 

Now, the comparison rules say to ignore word order, case, spacing, and typos. But the OCR output doesn't have the word "EXIT" anywhere. Instead, it mentions the number "1". The ground truth is "EXIT", which is a letter, not a number. 

So, the OCR output's text content doesn't include any of the unique words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, there's no mention of "EXIT" or any variation of it. The OCR output is talking about a number 1, which is unrelated to the word "EXIT". 

According to the categories, Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have "EXIT" and is instead describing a different element (number 1), it's unrelated. Therefore, the correct category should be 3.
