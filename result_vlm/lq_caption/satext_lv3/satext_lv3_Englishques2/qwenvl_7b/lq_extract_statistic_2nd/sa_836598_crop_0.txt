gt_text: RMERIE JANDA RMA JANDARMA
vlm_output: The image is blurry and does not clearly show any English text or characters. It appears to be an image of a horse with some equipment, but the details are not discernible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output to the ground truth text, following specific rules.

So, the ground truth is "RMERIE JANDA RMA JANDARMA". The OCR output says the image is blurry and doesn't show any English text or characters, mentioning a horse with equipment but no details. 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a description of the image, not actual text. It says there's no English text or characters visible. So, the extracted text would be the entire description, but the key part here is that it states there's no text. 

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has words like RMERIE, JANDA, RMA, JANDARMA. The OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. It's talking about a blurry image with a horse and equipment, not any text. 

The categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on unique words from the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. The ground truth words are all proper nouns, possibly names or terms, but the OCR output is completely unrelated, stating that there's no text. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even considering typos or case, the category would be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output is not matching any of the required words, and it's stating that there's no text, which is the opposite of the ground truth. Therefore, it's not partially correct or even correct. The answer should be 3.
