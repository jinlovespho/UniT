gt_text: km/h
vlm_output: The image shows the text "0 km/h".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, the ground truth text is "km/h". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows the text "0 km/h"."

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says "The image shows the text "0 km/h"." So the actual text content here is "0 km/h". 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "km/h". Let's break that down. The unique words here are "km/h". Wait, but "km/h" is a single unit, not a word. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "km/h" is a single token. However, the OCR output has "0 km/h". So the extracted text is "0 km/h".

Now, considering the rules: ignore order, case, spacing, and typos. The ground truth is "km/h". The OCR output has "0 km/h". So the OCR output includes "km/h" as part of the text. The "0" is an extra number, but the ground truth doesn't have that. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just "km/h". The OCR output contains "0" and "km/h". So the "km/h" is present. 

Wait, but the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has the word "km/h". The OCR output has "0" and "km/h". Since "km/h" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra "0", the unique words from the ground truth are all present. The "0" is an extra word not in the ground truth, but the ground truth's words are all there. 

But wait, the ground truth is "km/h", which is one unique word. The OCR output has "0" and "km/h". So the set of unique words in the OCR output includes "km/h", which matches the ground truth's unique words. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. So according to category 1, it's correct. 

But wait, the problem says "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has "km/h". The OCR output has "0 km/h". So the set of unique words in the OCR output includes "0" and "km/h". The ground truth's unique words are "km/h". So all the ground truth words (just "km/h") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it's category 1. 

But I need to check if the "0" is considered a typo or extra. The instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but the "0" is a number. However, the ground truth doesn't have a "0". But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must include all the unique words from the ground truth. Since "km/h" is present, even with an extra "0", it's still a match. 

So the answer would be category 1. However, I need to make sure that the OCR output's text includes the ground truth words. The OCR output's text is "0 km/h". The ground truth is "km/h". So "km/h" is present, so all unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output. Hence, category 1.
