gt_text: BEER
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "BEER".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEER". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English text in the image reads 'BEER'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "BEER" in quotes. So the extracted text here would be "BEER".

Next, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "BEER". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one word, "BEER", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

The OCR output has "BEER" exactly as in the ground truth. Even though the OCR output has more text around it, the key is that the word "BEER" is present. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if there were other words, as long as "BEER" is there, it's a match. Also, capitalization is ignored, but here both are uppercase, so that's fine. No typos either. 

So since the OCR output includes the exact word "BEER", which is the only unique word in the ground truth, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and all required words are present. Even if there were extra words, as long as the required ones are there, it's still correct. So the answer should be 1.
