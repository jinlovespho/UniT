gt_text: SOUTHPOINT
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HOTEL" in large, bold letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SOUTHPOINT", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'HOTEL' in large, bold letters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "HOTEL". So the extracted text is just "HOTEL".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth, which is "SOUTHPOINT". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "SOUTHPOINT" since it's a single word. 

Now, checking if "HOTEL" matches "SOUTHPOINT". Ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing, but the words themselves are different. There's no mention of "SOUTHPOINT" in the OCR output. The OCR output has "HOTEL" instead. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth ("SOUTHPOINT") and the OCR output has "HOTEL", which is a different word, there are no matches. Therefore, the category should be 3.
