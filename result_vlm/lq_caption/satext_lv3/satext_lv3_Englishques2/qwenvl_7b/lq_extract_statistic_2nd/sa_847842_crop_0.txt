gt_text: CIFA
vlm_output: The image is quite blurry, but it appears to show part of a sign with some English text. The text seems to include "SUN" and possibly other characters that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "CIFA". The OCR output from the VLM says the image is blurry but mentions "SUN" and possibly other unclear characters.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "SUN" and other characters that are not clear. The main text they extracted is "SUN" and possibly others, but the rest are not legible.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "CIFA", which is four letters. The OCR output has "SUN" as the only clear word. Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, unique words from ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just "CIFA" (assuming it's one word). The OCR output has "SUN" but that's not part of the ground truth. There's no mention of "CIFA" in the OCR output. The other characters are not legible, so they don't count. Since none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output, even considering typos or case, it's a mismatch. So the category would be 3 because there's no match. Even if there were typos, like if OCR had "cifa" but it's not there. So answer is 3.
