gt_text: NYHAVN randstraede
vlm_output: The image contains the word "MYHAVN" in large, bold letters. The text appears to be part of a larger phrase or sign, but the rest is not fully visible due to blurriness and the angle of the photo.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "NYHAVN randstraede". The VLM OCR output says it contains "MYHAVN" in large letters, but the rest isn't visible due to blurriness and angle.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "MYHAVN" as the only visible word. The rest is not fully visible, so the extracted text is just "MYHAVN".

Next, Step 2: Compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "NYHAVN" and "randstraede". The OCR output has "MYHAVN". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, compare unique words from the ground truth. Ignore capitalization and typos. So, "MYHAVN" vs "NYHAVN" – the letters are mostly the same except for the 'M' vs 'N'. But the problem says small typos still count as matches. However, "MYHAVN" is a typo for "NYHAVN"? Wait, but the OCR output has "MYHAVN" which is different from the ground truth's "NYHAVN". Is this a typo? If the OCR made a mistake in the first letter, like M instead of N, that's a typo. But the instruction says small typos still count as matches. But does "MYHAVN" count as a match for "NYHAVN"? 

Wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output has "MYHAVN" and the ground truth is "NYHAVN", the first letter is different. Is that considered a small typo? The 'M' vs 'N' is a single character difference. However, the problem is whether that's considered a small typo. But maybe the OCR output is "MYHAVN" and the ground truth is "NYHAVN", so the OCR is missing the 'N' and has an 'M'. But the user's instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output has "MYHAVN" and the ground truth is "NYHAVN", the OCR is missing the 'N' and has an 'M' instead. Is that considered a typo? It's a substitution of one letter. So maybe it's considered a small typo. However, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches," but I need to check if the OCR output contains the correct words with possible typos.

But the ground truth has two words: "NYHAVN" and "randstraede". The OCR output has "MYHAVN" and the rest is not visible. So the OCR output has one word that's a typo of the first ground truth word. The second word "randstraede" is not present in the OCR output. So the OCR output has one of the two unique words (with a typo), but not the other. 

According to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, only one of the two words is present (with a typo). So that would be category 2: partially correct. Because at least one word matches (assuming the typo is considered a match). But wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So even if it's a typo, it's considered a match. Therefore, "MYHAVN" is considered a match for "NYHAVN" (assuming the typo is acceptable). Then, the OCR output has one of the two words. So category 2 would be correct. 

But wait, the ground truth has "randstraede" which is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output only has "MYHAVN" (a typo of "NYHAVN"). So the OCR has one correct word (with typo) and the other word is missing. So category 2: partially correct. Therefore, the answer should be 2.
