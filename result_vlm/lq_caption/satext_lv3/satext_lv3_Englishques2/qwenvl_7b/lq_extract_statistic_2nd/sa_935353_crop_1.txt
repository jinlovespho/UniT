gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HOKKAIDO" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SCANIA", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'HOKKAIDO' in large, bold letters." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence, but the main text content is the word "HOKKAIDO". The rest is descriptive text like "The image contains the word... in large, bold letters." So the extracted text would be "HOKKAIDO".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "SCANIA", which is a single word. The comparison rules are:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word in each, that's not an issue here.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SCANIA".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "HOKKAIDO" which is all caps, but the ground truth is also all caps. However, the words themselves are different.
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, "HOKKAIDO" is not a typo of "SCANIA"; they are entirely different words.

So, the OCR output's extracted text is "HOKKAIDO", and the ground truth is "SCANIA". Since "HOKKAIDO" is not present in the ground truth, and there are no overlapping words, the comparison would result in zero matches. 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present.
- Category 2 is for partial matches. But since there's only one word in the ground truth and it's not matched, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated output. The OCR output mentions a different word entirely, so it's unrelated.

Therefore, the correct category should be 3.
