gt_text: Card only
vlm_output: The image contains the words "Card only" in white letters on a red background.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. Let me break down the steps as outlined.

First, the ground truth text is "Card only". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the words 'Card only' in white letters on a red background." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the words "Card only", so the extracted text here is "Card only". But wait, the OCR output has more text, but the instruction says to extract the text content. However, the example given in the problem might have the OCR output as the full sentence, but the user wants us to extract the actual text content. Wait, maybe the OCR output is the entire sentence, but we need to extract the words that are part of the text. Let me check the problem again.

The OCR output is: "The image contains the words 'Card only' in white letters on a red background." So the actual text content here is "Card only", which is in quotes. But maybe the OCR output is the entire sentence, and the task is to extract the words that are part of the text. Wait, the user says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So perhaps the OCR output is the full sentence, but the actual text that's extracted is "Card only" as that's the part that's in quotes. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is the full sentence, and we need to extract all the words from it, but the ground truth is "Card only".

Wait, the problem says: Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the OCR output is "The image contains the words 'Card only' in white letters on a red background." So the text content here would be all the words in that sentence. But the ground truth is "Card only". However, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Card" and "only".

So, Step 2: Compare the extracted text (from OCR) with the ground truth. The OCR output's text content includes "Card", "only", "white", "letters", "red", "background", etc. But the ground truth is "Card only". So the unique words in the ground truth are "Card" and "only".

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, typos. So in the OCR output, do "Card" and "only" appear? Yes, the OCR output says "Card only" in quotes. So the words "Card" and "only" are present. Therefore, both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, but here there are none. So according to category 1: Correct, all unique ground truth words appear.

Wait, but the OCR output has more words, but we only need to check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "Card" and "only" are both present, even if other words are there, it's okay. So the answer would be category 1.
