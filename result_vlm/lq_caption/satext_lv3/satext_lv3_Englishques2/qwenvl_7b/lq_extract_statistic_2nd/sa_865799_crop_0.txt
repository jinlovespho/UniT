Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "EY". The VLM OCR output is "The image shows the letters "EY" in white against a dark background. The letters appear to be part of a logo or sign."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "EY" explicitly. So the extracted text would include "EY" as part of the description.

Now, Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "EY". The OCR output has "EY" as well. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the OCR output has more words, as long as all unique words from the ground truth are present, it's category 1. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "EY". The OCR output includes "EY" exactly. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, since the ground truth only has "EY", and that's present, it's a correct match. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. So the answer should be category 1.
