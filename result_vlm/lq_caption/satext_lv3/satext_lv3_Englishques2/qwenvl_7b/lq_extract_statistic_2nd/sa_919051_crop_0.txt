gt_text: TRATTO
vlm_output: The image contains a blurry view of a building with some visible text. The words "WELCOME" and "HOTEL" are discernible, suggesting it might be part of a hotel sign. There is also a partial view of what appears to be a phone number, but it is not fully legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TRATTO". The VLM OCR output mentions "WELCOME", "HOTEL", and a partial phone number. So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The words there are "WELCOME", "HOTEL", and part of a phone number, but the phone number isn't fully legible.

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "TRATTO", which is one word. The OCR output doesn't mention "TRATTO" at all. The words present are "WELCOME" and "HOTEL", which are different. The phone number part isn't clear, but even if it had numbers, "TRATTO" isn't there. 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but the unique words in the ground truth are just "TRATTO". The OCR output doesn't have that word. So there's no match. Even if there were typos, like "Tratto" with a lowercase 't', but the OCR output has "WELCOME" and "HOTEL" which are unrelated. 

Therefore, the category should be 3 because none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is about a hotel sign, which is unrelated to "TRATTO". So the answer is 3.
