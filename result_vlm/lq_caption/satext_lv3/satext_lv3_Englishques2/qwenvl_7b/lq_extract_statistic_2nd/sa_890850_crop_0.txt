gt_text: OUTBACK SUPER-LITE
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "OUTBACK".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE" and a VLM OCR output that says "The visible English text in the image is 'OUTBACK'." The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible English text in the image is 'OUTBACK'." So, the extracted text would be "OUTBACK" since that's the actual text mentioned. The rest of the sentence is descriptive and not the text content itself. So, the extracted text is just "OUTBACK".

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE". The comparison rules are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only consider the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

So, the ground truth has two unique words: "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". The OCR output only has "OUTBACK". Let's check if "SUPER-LITE" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "OUTBACK", which is missing "SUPER-LITE". However, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output has one of the two words. Therefore, at least one unique word matches (OUTBACK), but not all. 

According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer should be 2. Wait, but let me make sure. The ground truth has two words. The OCR output has one. So, only one of the two words is present. That's partially correct, hence category 2. 

I need to check if there are any typos. The OCR output has "OUTBACK" which is exactly the same as the ground truth's "OUTBACK" (case doesn't matter, but here both are uppercase). So no typos here. The other word is "SUPER-LITE" which isn't in the OCR output. So, only one word matches. Therefore, category 2 is correct.
