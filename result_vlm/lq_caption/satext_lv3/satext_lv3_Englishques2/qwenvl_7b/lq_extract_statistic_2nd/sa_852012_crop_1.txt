Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "724". The VLM OCR output says that the image is blurry and doesn't show any English text or characters. It mentions abstract or out-of-focus photo with no discernible words or letters.

Step 1: Extract text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a description of the image, not the actual text. The user is probably trying to see if the OCR system correctly identified the text "724" from the image. But the OCR output here isn't giving any text; it's saying there's no text visible.

Step 2: Compare extracted text with ground truth. The ground truth is "724", which is a number. The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers or text. It says there's no English text or characters. So, the OCR didn't find any text, which is different from the ground truth. The question is whether the OCR output's text (which is a description) contains any words from the ground truth. But the ground truth is "724", which is a number. The OCR output's text is a description of the image, not the text present in it. 

Wait, the problem might be that the OCR is supposed to extract text from the image, but in this case, it's not detecting any text. The ground truth is "724", which is the actual text in the image. The OCR output says there's no text, which would mean it's incorrect. However, the instructions say to compare the extracted text from the OCR output with the ground truth. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't extract any text; it's a description of the image's content. So the extracted text would be the OCR's description, which is "The image is very blurry..." etc. But the ground truth is "724". The unique words in the ground truth are "724". The OCR output's extracted text has words like "image", "blurry", "English", "text", "characters", "abstract", "out-of-focus", "discernible", "words", "letters". None of these words are "724". So, the OCR output didn't find the text "724" in the image, which is the ground truth. Therefore, the category would be 3, since none of the unique words in the ground truth (which is just "724") are present in the OCR output's text. Even though the OCR output is talking about the absence of text, it's not mentioning the actual text that was supposed to be there. So the answer is 3.
