gt_text: JBL SONY
vlm_output: The image contains the following visible text:- "100%"- "100%"These appear to be percentages, possibly indicating a rating or score. The rest of the image is too blurry to discern any other details.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The ground truth text is "JBL SONY", and the VLM OCR output is a description that mentions "100%" twice and says the rest is blurry. The task is to compare the extracted text from the OCR output with the ground truth based on specific criteria.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a description, not actual text from an image. The visible text mentioned is "100%" and "100%", and the rest is blurry. So the extracted text would be "100%", "100%", and the rest is unclear. But the user probably wants the actual text that was recognized, which in this case is just the two instances of "100%".

Next, Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "JBL SONY", which are two brand names. The OCR output has "100%" repeated. Now, the comparison rules are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore case, punctuation, spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So the unique words in ground truth are "JBL" and "SONY". The OCR output has "100%", which is a percentage. There's no mention of "JBL" or "SONY" in the OCR output. The OCR output is talking about percentages, which are unrelated to the brands in the ground truth.

The categories are:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words are present.
2 — Partially correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: none or unrelated.

Since the OCR output doesn't mention "JBL" or "SONY" at all, there are zero matches. The OCR output is about percentages, which is unrelated. Therefore, it falls into category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 151
2. Slightly Correct Num: 73
3. Incorrect Num: 378
