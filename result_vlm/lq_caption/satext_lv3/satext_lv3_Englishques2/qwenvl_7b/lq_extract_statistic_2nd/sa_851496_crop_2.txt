gt_text: Jeep
vlm_output: The blurry image contains the word "Jeep" in a stylized font.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "Jeep" and the VLM OCR output is "The blurry image contains the word 'Jeep' in a stylized font." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so I need to look for any text that might be part of the content. The OCR output mentions the word "Jeep" explicitly. The rest of the sentence is descriptive, talking about a blurry image and a stylized font. But the main text here is "Jeep" as the word being mentioned.

Now, Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "Jeep". The OCR output has "Jeep" in it, so the unique word here is "Jeep". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "Jeep", we need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, which isn't an issue here since there's only one word. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "Jeep" in quotes, but the capitalization matches exactly. There are no typos in the OCR output's mention of "Jeep" compared to the ground truth. So, "Jeep" is a direct match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output includes that exact word, the category should be 1. The other parts of the OCR output like "blurry image" or "stylized font" are not part of the ground truth, but we're only checking for the presence of the ground truth words. The rest of the sentence is just context, and the key is that "Jeep" is present. So the answer should be 1.
