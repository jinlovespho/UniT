Okay, let's see. The user wants me to determine the category of the OCR output compared to the ground truth text. The ground truth is "9007", and the OCR output says "The image contains a sign with the word 'PARKING' written in English."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "PARKING" as the word on the sign. The ground truth is "9007", which is a number. 

Now, step 2 is to compare these. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth here is "9007", which is a number, not a word. So maybe the unique words in the ground truth would be just "9007"? But "9007" isn't a word; it's a number. However, the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is a number, does that count as a word? The instructions might be assuming that the ground truth is text, so maybe "9007" is treated as a single word here.

The OCR output's extracted text is "PARKING". Now, comparing the set of unique words. The ground truth has "9007", and the OCR output has "PARKING". These are completely different words. There's no overlap. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. 

But wait, the instructions mention that the OCR output might have typos but still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output didn't even recognize the number. It's possible that the OCR failed to detect the number and instead recognized the word "PARKING" which is present in the image. Since the ground truth is "9007", which isn't mentioned in the OCR output, there's no match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
