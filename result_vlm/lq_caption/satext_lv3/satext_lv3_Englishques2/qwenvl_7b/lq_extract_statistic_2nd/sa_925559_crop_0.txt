gt_text: SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "SPIETH".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is "SPIETH".".

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that mentions "SPIETH" once. So the extracted text from the OCR is just "SPIETH".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SPIETH" repeated three times. But according to the comparison rules, we need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth only has "SPIETH" as the unique word (even though it's repeated), we check if that word is present in the OCR output.

The OCR output has "SPIETH" once. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we ignore case, spacing, etc. Also, small typos still count as matches. Here, there's no typo; it's exactly "SPIETH" in both cases. So the OCR output contains the unique ground truth word "SPIETH".

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "SPIETH") are present in the OCR output, that would fall under category 1 — Correct. Even though the OCR only found one instance instead of three, the rules specify that we look at the set of unique words, not the count. So as long as all unique words are present, regardless of how many times they appear, it's a correct match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
