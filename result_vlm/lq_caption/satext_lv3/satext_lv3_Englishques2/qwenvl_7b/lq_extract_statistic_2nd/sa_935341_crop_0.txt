gt_text: CONTINENTAL
vlm_output: The image contains no visible English text or characters.

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "CONTINENTAL". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains no visible English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is stating that there's no text visible. So the extracted text would be the entire sentence provided.

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "CONTINENTAL". The OCR output says there's no text. 

The categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CONTINENTAL". The OCR output doesn't mention that word at all. It's saying there's no text, which is a negative statement. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output doesn't include "CONTINENTAL" (or any form of it, considering case and typos), there's no match. The OCR output is stating the absence of text, which is unrelated to the presence of the word "CONTINENTAL". 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output isn't even trying to mention the word; it's denying the presence of any text. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
