gt_text: CENTURY PARK HOTEL
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "CENTURY PARK HOTEL". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is blurry and no text is discernible. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the words: CENTURY, PARK, HOTEL. Let's look at the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters" but nothing about "century", "park", or "hotel". The OCR output is stating that there's no clear text, so it's not recognizing any words. 

Since none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even considering typos or different cases, the category should be 3. The OCR didn't recognize any of the words, so it's incorrect. The output is not related to the ground truth words at all. Therefore, the answer is 3.
