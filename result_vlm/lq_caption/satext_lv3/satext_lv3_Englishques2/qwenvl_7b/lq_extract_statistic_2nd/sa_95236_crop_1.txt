gt_text: TADANO ZE500
vlm_output: The image contains the text "TADANO" in English.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "TADANO ZE500" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the text 'TADANO' in English." The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The image contains the text 'TADANO' in English." So the extracted text would be "The image contains the text TADANO in English." But the user's instruction says to extract the text content, which I think refers to the actual words that are part of the OCR result. However, in this case, the OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "TADANO" and other words. But the ground truth is "TADANO ZE500". 

Now, Step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "TADANO" and "ZE500". The OCR output has the word "TADANO" (which matches exactly, case-insensitive, and ignoring spacing). However, there's no mention of "ZE500" in the OCR output. The OCR output's text includes "TADANO" but not "ZE500". 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match or output is unrelated.

Since the ground truth has two unique words, and the OCR output only has one of them ("TADANO"), that would be category 2 — partially correct. However, I need to check if "ZE500" is present in any form. The OCR output doesn't mention "ZE500" at all. So only "TADANO" is present. Therefore, it's partially correct. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "TADANO" and "ZE500". The OCR output has "TADANO" but not "ZE500". Therefore, only one of the two words is present. Hence, category 2.
