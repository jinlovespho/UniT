gt_text: 861 11940
vlm_output: The image is quite blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be read. The focus seems to be on a red vehicle, possibly an ambulance, but the details are not sharp enough to discern specific text or characters.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, the ground truth text is "861 11940". The VLM OCR output is a description that mentions a blurry image with a red vehicle, possibly an ambulance, but no clear text. 

Step 1 is to extract text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing the image, but there's no actual text extracted. The OCR didn't find any readable text, so the extracted text is probably empty or just the description. However, the user's instruction says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a paragraph, but it doesn't contain any numbers or words that match the ground truth. The ground truth is numbers, but the OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. 

Step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two numbers: 861 and 11940. The OCR output doesn't have any numbers. The OCR says there's no clear English text or characters. So, the extracted text from OCR is likely nothing related to numbers. 

Now, considering the categories: 
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. But the OCR output has no numbers, so the words (numbers) from the ground truth aren't present. 
- Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But there are no matches here. The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. 
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the numbers from the ground truth and is instead describing the image, it's unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 50
2. Slightly Correct Num: 21
3. Incorrect Num: 127
