gt_text: PARQUE LORO ANIMAL EMBASSY
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "LORO PARQUE" and "ANIMAL PARK".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text. The ground truth is "PARQUE LORO ANIMAL EMBASSY" and the OCR output says "The visible English text in the image reads 'LORO PARQUE' and 'ANIMAL PARK'." 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions "LORO PARQUE" and "ANIMAL PARK". So the extracted text here would be those two phrases. 

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to ignore word order, capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos are considered matches. The unique words in the ground truth are "PARQUE", "LORO", "ANIMAL", "EMBASSY". 

Looking at the OCR output, "LORO PARQUE" includes "LORO" and "PARQUE", which are both present in the ground truth. Then "ANIMAL PARK" has "ANIMAL" and "PARK". Now, "PARK" isn't in the ground truth; the ground truth has "EMBASSY" instead. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But "PARK" vs. "EMBASSY" isn't a typo—it's a different word entirely. So "PARK" isn't a match for "EMBASSY". 

So the OCR output has three words that match: "LORO", "PARQUE", and "ANIMAL". The fourth word in the ground truth, "EMBASSY", isn't present in the OCR output. Therefore, three out of four unique words are matched. But the categories are based on whether all unique words are present. Since "EMBASSY" is missing, does that make it partially correct (category 2) or incorrect (category 3)?

Wait, the categories are: 
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

In this case, the OCR output has three out of four words matching. So it's not all, but at least one. Therefore, it's category 2. But wait, the user said to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has four unique words: PARQUE, LORO, ANIMAL, EMBASSY. The OCR has LORO, PARQUE, ANIMAL, PARK. So three matches (LORO, PARQUE, ANIMAL) and one non-match (EMBASSY vs. PARK). Since all four are required for category 1, but three are present, it's category 2. 

But maybe I need to check if "PARK" is considered a typo of "EMBASSY"? No, that's not a small typo. So "EMBASSY" is missing entirely. Therefore, the answer should be category 2 because three words are correct, but not all four. Even though "PARK" is present, it's not part of the ground truth, so it's not counted. So category 2.
