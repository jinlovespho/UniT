gt_text: ROVER
vlm_output: The image contains the word "ROVER" in bold, uppercase letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "ROVER" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the word 'ROVER' in bold, uppercase letters." 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing the image, but the actual text content mentioned is "ROVER". So the extracted text would be "ROVER".

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "ROVER". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since both have the same word "ROVER", and ignoring case (though both are uppercase here), and there are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, even though the OCR output includes more context (like "in bold, uppercase letters"), the extracted text is "ROVER" which matches perfectly. Therefore, it should fall under category 1.
