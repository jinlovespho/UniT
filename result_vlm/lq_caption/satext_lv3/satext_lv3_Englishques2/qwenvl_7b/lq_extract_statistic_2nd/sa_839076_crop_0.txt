gt_text: NIKE zoomx
vlm_output: The image shows part of a shoe with some visible text. The text appears to be "NIKE" and possibly "AIR," but it is very blurry and not entirely clear due to the image quality.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE zoomx". The VLM OCR output says the text appears to be "NIKE" and possibly "AIR", but it's blurry.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "NIKE" and "AIR". But the ground truth has "NIKE" and "zoomx". 

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has two words: "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR output has "NIKE" and "AIR". 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, spacing, typos. But "zoomx" vs "AIR" – these are different words. The OCR didn't mention "zoomx" at all. It only got "NIKE" right, but the other word is "AIR" instead of "zoomx". 

So the unique words in ground truth are "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR has "NIKE" and "AIR". So only one of the two words matches. Therefore, it's partially correct. So category 2.
