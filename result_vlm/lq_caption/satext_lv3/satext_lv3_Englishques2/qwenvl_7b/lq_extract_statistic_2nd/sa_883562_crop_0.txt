gt_text: Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM
vlm_output: The image shows a sign with the number "2" prominently displayed in white against a blue background. The word "Portugal" is partially visible at the top left corner of the sign. There is also some additional text and numbers that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness of the image.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image shows a sign with the number '2' prominently displayed in white against a blue background. The word 'Portugal' is partially visible at the top left corner of the sign. There is also some additional text and numbers that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness of the image." 

So, the extracted text from the OCR would include the words: "number", "2", "prominently", "displayed", "white", "blue", "background", "Portugal", "partially", "visible", "top", "left", "corner", "sign", "additional", "text", "numbers", "not", "clearly", "legible", "blurriness", "image".

Now, the ground truth is "Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM". Let's break that down into unique words: "Platform", "Lumpur", "Kuala", "2", "SKTM".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the OCR output, the only word that matches the ground truth is "2". The other words in the ground truth ("Platform", "Lumpur", "Kuala", "SKTM") are not present in the OCR output. The OCR mentions "Portugal", "sign", "background", etc., which are not in the ground truth. 

Since the OCR output only has one of the unique words from the ground truth (the number 2), but the rest are missing, this would fall under category 2 — Slightly correct (partially correct), because at least one but not all unique words match. The category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present, which isn't the case here. Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated content, but since "2" is present, it's not category 3.
