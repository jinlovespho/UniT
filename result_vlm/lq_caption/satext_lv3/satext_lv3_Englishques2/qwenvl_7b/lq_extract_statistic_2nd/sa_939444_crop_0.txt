gt_text: PRESIDE DE
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SUNSET" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, let's look at the ground truth text: "PRESIDE DE". The user mentioned that we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. So breaking that down, the words are "PRESIDE" and "DE". 

Next, the VLM OCR output says: "The image contains the word 'SUNSET' in large, bold letters." The first step is to extract the text content from this OCR output. The extracted text here would be "The image contains the word 'SUNSET' in large, bold letters." But we need to process this text according to the given rules.

The rules state that we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "PRESIDE" and "DE". The OCR output's text includes words like "The", "image", "contains", "word", "SUNSET", "large", "bold", "letters". 

Now, considering the comparison rules:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only the unique words from the ground truth are considered. So we need to check if "PRESIDE" and "DE" are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos.

Looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The", "image", "contains", "the", "word", "SUNSET", "in", "large", "bold", "letters". None of these words are "PRESIDE" or "DE". Even if we ignore case, "preside" or "de" aren't there. The only word that might be similar is "SUNSET", but that's not related to the ground truth words.

Additionally, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo that would make "SUNSET" into "PRESIDE" or "DE". So there's no match for either of the ground truth words.

Therefore, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
