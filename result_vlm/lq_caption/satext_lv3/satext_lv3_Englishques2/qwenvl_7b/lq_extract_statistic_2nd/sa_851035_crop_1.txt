gt_text: HS-TXO
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "HS-TXO" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HS-TXO", which seems to be some kind of code or acronym. The comparison has specific rules:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

But wait, the ground truth is "HS-TXO". Let's break that down. The words here would be "HS" and "TXO" if we split by hyphens. However, the OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. The OCR output is stating that no text was discerned, which is a negative statement. So the OCR output is saying there's no text, but the ground truth is that there is text ("HS-TXO").

Now, the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Partially correct: At least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: No words match, or output is unrelated/empty.

In this case, the OCR output doesn't mention "HS" or "TXO" at all. It's actually saying the opposite: that no text was found. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3, since there are no matches and the output is unrelated (it's stating that there's no text, while the ground truth is that there is text).

But wait, maybe I should check if there's any possible match. The OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." The words here are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters". The ground truth is "HS-TXO", which is not present in any form. Even if we consider splitting "HS-TXO" into parts, like "HS" and "TXO", those are not present in the OCR output. The OCR output doesn't have any of those terms. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
