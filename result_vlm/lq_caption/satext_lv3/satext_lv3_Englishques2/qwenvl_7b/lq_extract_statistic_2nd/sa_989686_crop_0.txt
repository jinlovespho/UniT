Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1986 3d". The VLM OCR output says: "The image contains the following visible text: "3d" and "1986"."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "3d" and "1986". So the extracted text would be "3d" and "1986".

Now, comparing with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "1986" and "3d". The OCR output has exactly those two words. The order doesn't matter, so even if they were reversed, it's okay. Also, there's no capitalization difference here because "3d" is lowercase in both. The OCR output has the same words as the ground truth. No typos mentioned here. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1.
