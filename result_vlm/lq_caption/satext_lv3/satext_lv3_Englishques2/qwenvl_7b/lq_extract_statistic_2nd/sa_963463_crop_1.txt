gt_text: TOWERBANK
vlm_output: The image shows part of a building with a sign that includes the word "TOWERBANK" and a logo featuring a green star with a white outline, which is associated with Starbucks. The text appears to be partially obscured due to blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "TOWERBANK". The VLM OCR output mentions "TOWERBANK" explicitly. So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says it shows part of a building with a sign that includes "TOWERBANK" and a logo with a green star (Starbucks). 

Now, Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "TOWERBANK". The OCR output includes "TOWERBANK" exactly as in the ground truth. The other parts of the OCR output mention Starbucks and a logo, but those aren't part of the ground truth. However, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "TOWERBANK" is present in the OCR output, even though there's extra information, the key is that all unique words from the ground truth (just "TOWERBANK") are present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since "TOWERBANK" is there, even with extra text, it should be category 1. The other parts of the OCR output don't affect this because the ground truth only has "TOWERBANK". Also, the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, capitalization, etc., but here the word is exactly the same. So the answer should be 1.
