gt_text: Mercure Mercure
vlm_output: The image shows part of a sign with the word "Mercure" visible in English. The rest of the text is not clearly legible due to the blurriness of the image.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "Mercure Mercure". So, the unique words here are just "Mercure" since it's repeated. The VLM OCR output says: "The image shows part of a sign with the word 'Mercure' visible in English. The rest of the text is not clearly legible due to the blurriness of the image."

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "Mercure" once. The rest of the text is about the image being blurry and not legible, but the key part here is that "Mercure" is explicitly mentioned.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are {"Mercure"}. The OCR output has "Mercure" as well. 

Now, considering the criteria:
- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, which is present in the OCR output.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. The OCR output has "Mercure" which matches exactly in spelling (assuming the OCR didn't make a typo here, but the problem says small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo; it's exactly "Mercure").
- The OCR output has "Mercure" once, which is all that's needed since the ground truth has it twice but we're only considering unique words.

So, since all unique ground truth words (just "Mercure") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
