gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: The image contains the word "RESTAURACJA" which is Polish for "restaurant."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA", which is Polish for "restaurant". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'RESTAURACJA' which is Polish for 'restaurant.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "RESTAURACJA" and "restaurant". But the ground truth is only "RESTAURACJA". Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "RESTAURACJA". 

Now, the OCR output includes "RESTAURACJA" exactly as in the ground truth, even though it's in quotes. Also, it mentions "restaurant" in English. But the ground truth is the Polish word. The instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "RESTAURACJA" which matches exactly in terms of letters, case doesn't matter, but here it's all caps. But the ground truth is also all caps. Wait, the ground truth is "RESTAURACJA", which is the same as in the OCR output. So the OCR output includes the exact word from the ground truth. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "RESTAURACJA". The OCR output has that word. So according to the criteria, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Even though there's additional text ("which is Polish for 'restaurant'"), the main thing is that the ground truth word is present. 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, there's no typo. The OCR output has the exact word. So the answer should be category 1. The other part about "restaurant" is extra info but not relevant since the ground truth is only the Polish word. So the category is 1.
