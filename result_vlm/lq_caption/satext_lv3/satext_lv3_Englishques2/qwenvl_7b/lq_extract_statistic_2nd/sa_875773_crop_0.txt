gt_text: KAUPPAKATU
vlm_output: The image contains a blurry street sign with some text that appears to be in English. The visible text includes "KAMPUS" and what seems to be part of another word starting with "P". The rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "KAUPPAKATU". The OCR output from the VLM says there's a blurry street sign with "KAMPUS" and part of another word starting with "P". The rest is unclear.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "KAMPUS" and a word starting with "P", but the rest is blurry. So the extracted words are "KAMPUS" and "P..." (but the rest is unclear). However, the OCR output doesn't mention "KAUPPAKATU" at all. 

Now, Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "KAUPPAKATU". The OCR output has "KAMPUS" and a partial word starting with "P". Let's check if any of these match the ground truth words. 

The ground truth word is "KAUPPAKATU". The OCR output has "KAMPUS" which is different. The other part is a word starting with "P", but even if it's "PA" or something, it's not matching "KAUPPAKATU". Also, considering that the OCR might have typos, but "KAMPUS" is not close to "KAUPPAKATU" even with typos. The "P" part might be a typo for "PA", but that's not the full word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "KAUPPAKATU" (since it's a single word). The OCR output doesn't have that word. So, no matches. Therefore, according to the categories, since there are no matches, it's category 3: Incorrect.
