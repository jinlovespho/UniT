gt_text: DXC.technology
vlm_output: The image contains some blurry text and symbols. The most visible part appears to be "CXO" followed by what looks like a website address starting with "cxo.co.uk". There are also some geometric shapes above the text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided the ground truth text "DXC.technology" and the VLM OCR output. They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "CXO" and "cxo.co.uk". The rest is about blurry text and geometric shapes, which aren't text content. So the extracted text from OCR is "CXO", "cxo.co.uk", and maybe "website address" but the latter is not a word from the ground truth.

Next, Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "DXC.technology". Let's break it down into unique words. Since there's only one word here, "DXC.technology". But maybe we should consider splitting it into parts? Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is one word: "DXC.technology". But maybe "DXC" and "technology" are considered separate? Wait, the user says "unique words in the ground truth". The original text is "DXC.technology", which is a single word with a period. But maybe the period is part of the word. However, the instructions mention ignoring punctuation. So, if we remove punctuation, "DXC.technology" becomes "DXC technology".

Wait, the instructions say: "Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So, the ground truth is "DXC.technology", but when we process it, we remove punctuation and ignore case. So, "DXC technology" (without the period). But the OCR output has "CXO" and "cxo.co.uk". Let's process those as well. "CXO" becomes "cxo" (lowercase), and "cxo.co.uk" becomes "cxo co uk" (splitting on periods and dots, but maybe the OCR output is "cxo.co.uk" as a single term? Wait, the OCR output says "website address starting with 'cxo.co.uk'". So, the extracted text is "CXO" and "cxo.co.uk". But according to the instructions, we need to compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "DXC.technology", which, when processed (ignoring punctuation and case), becomes "dxc technology". So the unique words are "dxc" and "technology".

Now, looking at the OCR output's extracted text: "CXO" and "cxo.co.uk". Processing these: "CXO" becomes "cxo" (lowercase), and "cxo.co.uk" becomes "cxo co uk" (split into three words). So the unique words here are "cxo", "co", "uk".

Comparing the two sets:

Ground truth words (processed): {"dxc", "technology"}
OCR output words (processed): {"cxo", "co", "uk"}

None of these words match. "CXO" is not "DXC", and "technology" isn't present. So there's no overlap. Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect, since no words match. But wait, the user said "small typos still count as matches". However, "CXO" vs "DXC" is a typo? Well, "CXO" is different from "DXC", but maybe if there's a typo where letters are swapped. But the instruction says "small typos still count as matches". However, "CXO" and "DXC" are different. Let me check the exact wording: "Small typos still count as matches." So, if the OCR had "D XC.technology" with a space, or "DXC.technolog" missing an 'y', that would count. But "CXO" is not a typo of "DXC". It's a different set of letters. So, no match here.

Therefore, the answer is category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 250
2. Slightly Correct Num: 119
3. Incorrect Num: 608
