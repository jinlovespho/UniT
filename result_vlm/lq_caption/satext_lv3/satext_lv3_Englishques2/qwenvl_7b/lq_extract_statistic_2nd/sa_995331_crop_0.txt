Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "BSN". The VLM OCR output says, "The image shows a building with a sign that includes the letters 'BSN' and some other characters that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "BSN" explicitly. The rest of the text describes the image but doesn't contain any other words that match the ground truth. 

Now, Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The unique word in the ground truth is "BSN". The OCR output has "BSN" in quotes, so that's a direct match. The other parts of the OCR output don't have any other words that are part of the ground truth. 

Considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word to check. The OCR output includes "BSN" exactly as in the ground truth, ignoring case (though both are uppercase here), and there are no typos mentioned. Since the OCR output has the exact word, even though there's more text around it, the key is that the unique word from the ground truth is present. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "BSN") are present, it should be category 1.
