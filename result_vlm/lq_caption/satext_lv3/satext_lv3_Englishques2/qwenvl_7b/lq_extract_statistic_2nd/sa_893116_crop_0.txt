gt_text: ENTRANCE FERRY EXIT FOR BOARDING STEPS WESTERN
vlm_output: The image contains some blurry text that appears to be in English. The words "SUNRISE" and "SUNSET" are partially visible, suggesting it might be part of a sign or display related to times for sunrise and sunset.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text and categorize the result as 1, 2, or 3 based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image contains some blurry text that appears to be in English. The words 'SUNRISE' and 'SUNSET' are partially visible, suggesting it might be part of a sign or display related to times for sunrise and sunset." So the extracted text here is mentioning "SUNRISE" and "SUNSET" as the key words.

Next, the ground truth text is "ENTRANCE FERRY EXIT FOR BOARDING STEPS WESTERN". Let's break that down into unique words, ignoring case, punctuation, and spaces. The unique words here are: ENTRANCE, FERRY, EXIT, FOR, BOARDING, STEPS, WESTERN.

Now, comparing the OCR output's extracted words with the ground truth. The OCR output has "SUNRISE" and "SUNSET", which are not present in the ground truth. The ground truth words are all related to a ferry entrance and steps, while the OCR output is talking about sunrise and sunset times. There's no overlap in the unique words between the two. 

The criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, but we have to check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since none of the words like ENTRANCE, FERRY, etc., are in the OCR output, there's no match. The OCR output is talking about completely different words. Even if there were a typo, like "SUNRISE" being a typo for "SUNSET", but those aren't in the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated, this would fall under category 3. The OCR output didn't capture any of the ground truth words, and the content is unrelated.
