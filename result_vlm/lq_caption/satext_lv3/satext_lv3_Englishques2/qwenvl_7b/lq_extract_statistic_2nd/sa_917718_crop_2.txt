gt_text: KENDA
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any visible English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KENDA". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any visible English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be seen. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "KENDA". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one word, "KENDA", I need to check if that word appears in the OCR output.

But the OCR output doesn't mention "KENDA" at all. It talks about the image being blurry and not being able to discern any text. So there's no mention of the word "KENDA" in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words (only "KENDA"), it falls into category 3. The output is saying there's no text visible, which is unrelated to the actual ground truth text. So the answer should be 3.
