gt_text: GEOTAB
vlm_output: The image contains the word "GEOTAB" in blue capital letters.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a ground truth text "GEOTAB" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the word 'GEOTAB' in blue capital letters." The task is to determine the category based on the steps given.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "GEOTAB" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "GEOTAB" (since the rest is descriptive text about the image, but the actual word is there).

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "GEOTAB", which is a single word. The OCR output has "GEOTAB" exactly as the ground truth. Now, the comparison rules say to ignore word order (though there's only one word here), case (but both are uppercase), punctuation (none here), and extra/missing spaces (there are none). Also, small typos still count as matches. Since the OCR output has the exact word, there's no typo. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "GEOTAB". The OCR output also includes "GEOTAB" as a word. So all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words are present, the answer should be 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output includes the exact word, so it's fully correct. No other words are present that would cause confusion. The description around it doesn't affect the comparison since we only look at the extracted text. So the category is 1.
