gt_text: TEATRO SOLIS
vlm_output: The image contains the words "TEATRO SOLIS" in capital letters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "TEATRO SOLIS" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the words 'TEATRO SOLIS' in capital letters." The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific comparison rules.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions the words "TEATRO SOLIS" in capital letters. So the extracted text here is "TEATRO SOLIS".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is exactly "TEATRO SOLIS". The rules specify that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still be considered a match. However, in this case, the order is the same.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The OCR output also has these exact words. 

Now, checking the other rules: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output uses capital letters, same as the ground truth, so capitalization isn't an issue here. There's no punctuation in either, and the spacing is correct (one space between the words). 

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case. Both texts are identical in terms of words, case, and spacing.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, and there are no mismatches, this should fall under Category 1: Correct. The answer is 1.
