Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the number "1" in white, which is likely part of a sign or marker."

First, step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence describing the image, but the actual text content here is the number "1". Wait, but the OCR output is the description, not the extracted text. Wait, maybe I need to parse the OCR output for any text content. The OCR output says "the number '1'", so the extracted text would be "1".

Step 2: Compare the extracted text (which is "1") with the ground truth "1". The unique words in ground truth are just {"1"}. Now check if that's present in the OCR output's extracted text. The OCR output mentions the number "1", so the extracted text is "1". So the unique word "1" is present. Therefore, category 1: correct.

But wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "1", so the unique words are just "1". The OCR output's extracted text is "1", so it's present. Therefore, all unique words match. So category 1.
