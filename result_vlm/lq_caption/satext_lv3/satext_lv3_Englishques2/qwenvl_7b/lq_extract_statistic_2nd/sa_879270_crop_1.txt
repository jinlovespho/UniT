gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: The image contains the word "EVERGREEN" in capital letters.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN", which is a single word. The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'EVERGREEN' in capital letters." 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. So, the OCR output is a sentence, but the main text here is "EVERGREEN" as it's in quotes. The rest is descriptive text, like "The image contains the word... in capital letters." But the actual extracted text would be "EVERGREEN" since that's the word mentioned.

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "EVERGREEN". The OCR output's extracted text is also "EVERGREEN". Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word in both cases.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EVERGREEN".
- Ignore capitalization: the OCR output's word is in capital letters, same as the ground truth. So no issue here.
- Ignore punctuation and spaces. The OCR output has the word in quotes, but the actual word is "EVERGREEN" without any extra spaces or punctuation.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here; the word is exactly the same.

So, the OCR output correctly identified the word "EVERGREEN" as present. Since all unique words (only one here) from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. 

I don't see any other words in the OCR output that are different. The rest of the sentence is just describing the image, but the extracted text is the word itself. Therefore, the answer is 1.
