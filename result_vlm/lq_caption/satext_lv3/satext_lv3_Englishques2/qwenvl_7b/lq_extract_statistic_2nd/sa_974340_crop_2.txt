gt_text: 80
vlm_output: The image is blurry and does not contain any visible English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "80". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is blurry and does not contain any visible English text or characters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence describing the image as blurry with no visible text. The actual text in the image is supposed to be "80", but the OCR didn't detect any text.

Now, step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "80". The OCR output doesn't mention "80" at all. It talks about the image being blurry and no text being visible. 

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "80". The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "contain", "visible", "English", "text", "characters". None of these are "80". 

So, the OCR output didn't detect the "80" text. According to the criteria, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. Even if there were typos or partial matches, but here there's no match at all. The OCR output is saying there's no text, which is incorrect because the ground truth has "80". But the comparison is about whether the OCR output contains the ground truth words. Since it doesn't, category 3 applies.
