gt_text: HUIS ANNE FRANK
vlm_output: The image shows a door with a small sign attached to it. The sign appears to have some text on it, but due to the blurriness and angle, the text is not clearly legible. There are no distinct English words or characters that can be confidently identified from the image.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "HUIS ANNE FRANK". The VLM OCR output says that the image shows a door with a sign, but the text on the sign isn't clearly legible due to blurriness and angle. It mentions there are no distinct English words or characters that can be confidently identified.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is describing the image, not providing the actual text from the sign. The OCR didn't recognize any words, so the extracted text from the OCR output would be the description itself, which is about the door and the sign being blurry. But the user might be expecting that the OCR output should have the text from the sign, but in this case, the OCR output is stating that it couldn't read the text. 

Now, Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HUIS ANNE FRANK". The OCR output's extracted text doesn't include any of those words. The OCR says that the text is not legible and no English words can be identified. So, there's no mention of "HUIS", "ANNE", or "FRANK" in the OCR output. 

Considering the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Here, none are present. 
- Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But since the OCR output doesn't mention any words, even with typos or case differences, there's nothing here. 
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is unrelated because it's describing the inability to read the text, not providing the actual text. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
