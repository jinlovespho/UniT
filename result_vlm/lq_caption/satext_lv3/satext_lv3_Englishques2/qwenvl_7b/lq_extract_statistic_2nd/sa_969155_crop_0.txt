gt_text: OFFICE POST
vlm_output: The image contains the words "POST OFFICE" in capital letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OFFICE POST". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the words 'POST OFFICE' in capital letters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "POST OFFICE". The rest is just descriptive, like "The image contains the words... in capital letters." So the actual extracted text would be "POST OFFICE".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "OFFICE POST". The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Both have the words "POST" and "OFFICE". The OCR output has them in reverse order, but since order doesn't matter, that's okay. Also, they're both in capital letters, so case is ignored. There are no typos mentioned here, just the order. Since both words are present, even though the order is swapped, it should count as correct. The category would be 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, regardless of order, case, or spacing. There's no missing words or typos. So the answer should be 1.
