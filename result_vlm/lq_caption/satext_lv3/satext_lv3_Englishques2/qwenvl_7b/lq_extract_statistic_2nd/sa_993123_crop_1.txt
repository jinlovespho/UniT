gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "HSBC".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is "HSBC"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the phrase "HSBC" within quotes. So the extracted text here would be "HSBC". 

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "HSBC". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, but since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "HSBC". The OCR output also has "HSBC" as the only unique word. The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. There are no typos here, so that's a match. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they are), 
2 if partially correct, 
3 if none match. 

Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth word, even though it's within a sentence, the extracted text is "HSBC" which is the same as the ground truth. So the category should be 1.
