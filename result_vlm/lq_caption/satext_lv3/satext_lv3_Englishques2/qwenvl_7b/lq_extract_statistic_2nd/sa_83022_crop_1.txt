gt_text: PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K
vlm_output: The image shows a sign with the word "PLAZA" and "MAYOR" in English.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image shows a sign with the word 'PLAZA' and 'MAYOR' in English." So the extracted text here is "PLAZA" and "MAYOR". Wait, but the OCR output is a sentence, but the actual words mentioned are "PLAZA" and "MAYOR". The rest of the sentence is descriptive, like "the image shows a sign with the word... in English." So the OCR output's extracted text would be the words "PLAZA" and "MAYOR".

Now, the ground truth text is "PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K". Let's process that. The unique words here, ignoring case and punctuation, would be "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "madrid", and "Km". But since we're supposed to compare based on unique words in the ground truth, and ignore case, "madrid" and "MADRID" are the same. So the unique words are "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "Km". Wait, the original ground truth has "madrid" lowercase and "MADRID" uppercase, but we ignore case, so they count as one. Then "Km" and "K" — the ground truth has "Km. K". Let me check again. The ground truth text is "PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K". Breaking it down:

- "PLAZA" (uppercase)
- "MADRID" (uppercase)
- "MAYOR" (uppercase)
- "madrid" (lowercase)
- "Km." (with a period)
- "K" (uppercase)

But according to the instructions, we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring case, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So let's normalize them:

- "PLAZA" and "madrid" (case-insensitive) become "plaza" and "madrid".
- "MADRID" is same as "madrid".
- "MAYOR" is "mayor".
- "Km." would be "km" (ignoring the period).
- "K" is "k".

So the unique words in the ground truth are: plaza, madrid, mayor, km, k. Wait, but "Km" and "K" might be considered as separate? Wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "Km." and "K". If we ignore punctuation, "Km." becomes "km" and "K" is "k". So the unique words would be "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". However, the original ground truth text might have "Km. K" as part of the text. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So maybe "Km" and "K" are considered separate? Or does "Km" and "K" count as different? Let me recheck the instructions.

The instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has "Km." and "K". But if we ignore punctuation, "Km." becomes "km" and "K" is "k". So the unique words in the ground truth are "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". Wait, but the original text is "PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K". So the words are "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "madrid", "Km.", "K". When normalized (case and punctuation ignored), they become "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". So the unique words in the ground truth are plaza, madrid, mayor, km, k.

Now, looking at the OCR output's extracted text. The OCR says "PLAZA" and "MAYOR". So the words here are "plaza" and "mayor" (case-insensitive). So the OCR output has "plaza" and "mayor" as the words present.

Now, comparing the OCR output's words to the ground truth's unique words. The OCR has "plaza" and "mayor". The ground truth has "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". So the OCR output has two of the five unique words from the ground truth. The other three (madrid, km, k) are not present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, only two out of five, so not category 1.

2 — Slightly correct (partially correct): at least one but not all unique words match. Here, two words match, so this would be category 2.

Wait, but the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has five unique words (plaza, madrid, mayor, km, k). The OCR output has two of those (plaza, mayor). So that's at least one (actually two) but not all. So category 2.

But wait, the instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there are no typos in the OCR output. The OCR output has "PLAZA" and "MAYOR", which are exact matches (case-insensitive) to the ground truth's "PLAZA" and "MAYOR".

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
