gt_text: Phedra
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Phedra". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "Phedra". The OCR output doesn't mention "Phedra" at all. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read any text. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Phedra". The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters". None of these are "Phedra" or any variation of it. 

Also, the rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no mention of "Phedra" at all. So even with typos, there's nothing. The OCR output is not related to the ground truth word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, it's category 3.
