gt_text: M-3175
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be read.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text "M-3175" and the VLM OCR output "The image is very blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be read."

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing that the image is blurry and there's no clear text. So the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence: "The image is very blurry and does not contain any clear English text or characters that can be read."

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "M-3175," which is a single string. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the ground truth here is not a set of words but a single alphanumeric string. Wait, maybe I need to parse the ground truth into words. But "M-3175" is a single token, not multiple words. So the unique words in the ground truth would just be "M-3175".

Now, the comparison criteria: check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output's words are: The, image, is, very, blurry, and, does, not, contain, any, clear, English, text, or, characters, that, can, be, read. None of these words are "M-3175". The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters" but not the specific string "M-3175". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are in OCR (but here, the ground truth has only one unique word, which isn't present).
2 if at least one but not all (but since there's only one, if it's not present, it's 0).
3 if none match or output is wrong/unrelated.

Since the OCR output doesn't mention "M-3175" at all, and the ground truth's only word isn't present, the category would be 3. The OCR output is stating that there's no readable text, which is why it's not matching the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
