gt_text: CA △BC
vlm_output: The image is very blurry and it's difficult to make out specific details. However, there appears to be some text or characters that might be part of a logo or emblem. The text seems to include the letters "S" and possibly "A" or "R", but the rest is not clear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "CA △BC". The VLM OCR output says there's blurry text with possible letters "S" and maybe "A" or "R", but it's unclear.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "S", "A", or "R". But the ground truth has "CA" and "△BC". The triangle symbol might be a typo or a different character. Let me check the exact words. The OCR output doesn't mention "CA" or "BC" explicitly. It talks about "S", "A", or "R" but not the exact letters in the ground truth. 

Step 2: Compare. The unique words in ground truth are "CA" and "△BC". The OCR output has "S", "A", "R" as possible letters. But "CA" would be "C" and "A", and "△BC" has "B", "C", and a triangle. The OCR mentions "A" but not "C" or "B" or the triangle. Also, the OCR is unsure about the letters. Since the OCR didn't capture the exact words from the ground truth, even considering typos, there's no match for "CA" or "△BC". The OCR didn't mention "C" or "B" in the context of those words. So, no unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it's category 3.
