gt_text: PKP
vlm_output: The image contains a blurry blue sign with white text that appears to read "WELCOME".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PKP", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains a blurry blue sign with white text that appears to read 'WELCOME'." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the text on the sign is "WELCOME". So the extracted text here is "WELCOME".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth "PKP". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "PKP". The OCR output has "WELCOME". Now, checking if there's any overlap. "PKP" isn't present in "WELCOME". Are there any typos or variations? The problem mentions small typos still count as matches, but "WELCOME" and "PKP" are entirely different words. There's no overlap in letters or possible typos here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "PKP" isn't in "WELCOME" and there's no partial match, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Therefore, it's category 3.
