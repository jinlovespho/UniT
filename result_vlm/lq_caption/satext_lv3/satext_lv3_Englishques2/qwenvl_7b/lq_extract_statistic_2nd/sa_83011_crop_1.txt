gt_text: CJ03ADM DUSTER
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CJ03ADM DUSTER". The VLM OCR output says "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER". The OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read text. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique words here are "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER". The OCR output doesn't have either of these words. Even if we consider typos or case, the OCR output doesn't have any of those words. It's not even trying to guess them; it's stating that there's no text. 

So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is saying there's no text, which is incorrect because the ground truth has text. But since the OCR didn't recognize any words, there's no match. Therefore, category 3.
