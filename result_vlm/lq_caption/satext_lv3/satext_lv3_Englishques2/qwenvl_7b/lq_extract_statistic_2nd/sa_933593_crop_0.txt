gt_text: 03 -0700 8964 8964-0700
vlm_output: The image is very blurry, but it appears to show a pink background with some text in white and possibly other colors. The text includes the words "I'm" and "love" which seem to be part of a larger phrase that is not fully legible due to the blurriness. There might also be some other characters or symbols next to these words, but they are not clear enough to identify definitively.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on how well it matches the ground truth text.

So, the ground truth text is "03 -0700 8964 8964-0700". The OCR output says that the image is blurry with a pink background and some text in white and other colors. The text includes "I'm" and "love" but the rest is not legible.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions words like "I'm", "love", and mentions other characters or symbols that aren't clear. But the main text content here is "I'm" and "love".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has numbers and hyphens: "03", "-0700", "8964", "8964-0700". The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. Instead, it talks about words like "I'm" and "love", which are not part of the ground truth text. 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the ground truth is all numbers and symbols. The OCR output has words like "I'm" and "love", which are not in the ground truth. The ground truth doesn't have any words; it's all numbers and hyphens. So the unique words in the ground truth are "03", "0700", "8964", etc. But the OCR output has no numbers, only words. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match (which they don't here), 2 if at least one matches (but none do), so it's category 3: incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, as it's describing a blurry image with text that's not the numbers in the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 155
2. Slightly Correct Num: 76
3. Incorrect Num: 400
