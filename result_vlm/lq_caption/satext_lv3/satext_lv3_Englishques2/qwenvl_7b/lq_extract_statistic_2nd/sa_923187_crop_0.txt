gt_text: Cannabis
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Cannabis" in English.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "Cannabis" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the word 'Cannabis' in English." 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is the sentence "The image contains the word 'Cannabis' in English." So, the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "Cannabis." The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "Cannabis." The OCR output has several words: "The," "image," "contains," "the," "word," "'Cannabis'," "in," "English." But we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The key here is that the OCR output includes the exact word "Cannabis" (even with the quotes, but we ignore punctuation). Also, the case doesn't matter, so "Cannabis" is the same as "cannabis." 

Since the OCR output contains the word "Cannabis" exactly as in the ground truth (ignoring punctuation and case), and there's only one unique word in the ground truth, all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no mention of any typos here, and the word is present. Even if there were a small typo, like "Cannabis" vs. "Cannabiss," it would still count as a match. But in this case, it's exact. So the answer should be 1.
