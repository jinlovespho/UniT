vlm_output: The image contains a series of numbers and letters: "86346". There is also some text that appears to be in a non-English script, possibly Chinese, but it is not clearly legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided the ground truth text as "86346" and the VLM OCR output as "The image contains a series of numbers and letters: '86346'. There is also some text that appears to be in a non-English script, possibly Chinese, but it is not clearly legible due to the blurriness."

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions the numbers "86346" explicitly. The rest of the text talks about other elements like non-English script, but the main part here is the "86346".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "86346". The OCR output includes that exact number. Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "86346". The OCR output includes that same number. 

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Since the number is the same, there's no issue there. Typos are considered matches if they're small, but in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output correctly includes the exact number. 

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. The ground truth has one unique word, which is present in the OCR output. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
