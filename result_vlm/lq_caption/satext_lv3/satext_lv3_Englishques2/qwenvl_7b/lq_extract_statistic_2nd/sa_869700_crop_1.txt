gt_text: FURUNO
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FURUNO", and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is too blurry to read any text. The actual text extracted would be the entire sentence, but since we're looking for words that match the ground truth, I need to check if any words in the OCR output correspond to the ground truth words.

The ground truth is "FURUNO", which is a single word. The OCR output doesn't mention "FURUNO" at all. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to discern text. So there's no mention of the company name or any related terms. 

Now, moving to Step 2: comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "FURUNO". The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters". None of these words are "FURUNO" or any variation that could be considered a typo. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, even considering typos, the answer should be category 3.
