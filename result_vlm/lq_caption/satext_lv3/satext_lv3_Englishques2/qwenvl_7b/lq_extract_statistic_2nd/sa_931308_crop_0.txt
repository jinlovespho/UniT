gt_text: Platform
vlm_output: The image shows a sign with the word "Platform" partially visible and the number "1" in large white font on an orange background. The rest of the text is cut off and not fully legible due to blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "Platform" and a VLM OCR output. They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The image shows a sign with the word 'Platform' partially visible and the number '1' in large white font on an orange background. The rest of the text is cut off and not fully legible due to blurriness." So the extracted text here includes "Platform" and "1", along with other descriptive words like "sign", "partially visible", "number", "large white font", "orange background", "rest of the text", "cut off", "not fully legible", "blurriness".

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, which is just "Platform". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches. The categories are based on whether all unique ground truth words are present (category 1), some (category 2), or none (category 3).

The ground truth has only one unique word: "Platform". The OCR output includes "Platform" exactly as it is. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the key is that the ground truth's unique words are present. Since "Platform" is present in the OCR output, even if there are other words, that's all that's needed for category 1. The other words in the OCR output don't affect the comparison because the ground truth only has "Platform". 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any typos. The OCR output says "Platform" with a capital P and lowercase letters, which matches the ground truth exactly. So there's no typo here. Also, the rest of the text in the OCR output doesn't include any other words from the ground truth, but since the ground truth only has "Platform", and that's present, the answer should be category 1.
