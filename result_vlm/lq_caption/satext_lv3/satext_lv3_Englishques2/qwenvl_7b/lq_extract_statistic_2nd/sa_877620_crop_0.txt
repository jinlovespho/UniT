gt_text: ZONE NO FLY
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "NO FLY ZONE."

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZONE NO FLY" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'NO FLY ZONE.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible text is "NO FLY ZONE." So the actual extracted text here is "NO FLY ZONE."

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ZONE NO FLY." The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is different, the words are the same. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "ZONE," "NO," and "FLY." The OCR output has "NO," "FLY," and "ZONE." All three words are present. The OCR output might have extra words like "The visible English text in the image reads" but the key part is the quoted text "NO FLY ZONE," which includes all the necessary words. 

Also, the comparison should ignore capitalization, so "NO" and "NO" are the same. Punctuation like the quotes around the OCR text don't affect the words. There are no typos mentioned here. Since all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct.
