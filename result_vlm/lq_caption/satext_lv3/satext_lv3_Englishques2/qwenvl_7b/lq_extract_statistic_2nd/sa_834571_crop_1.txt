gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SOLD" in bold red letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "SOLD". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'SOLD' in bold red letters."

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SOLD" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "SOLD" (since that's the main text mentioned).

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "SOLD". The OCR output includes "SOLD" exactly as in the ground truth. 

Now, considering the comparison rules:
- Word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word.
- Unique words in ground truth: {"SOLD"}.
- Ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here.
- Punctuation and spacing: the OCR output has other words like "The", "image", "contains", "in", "bold", "red", "letters", but the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "SOLD", so we check if that word is present in the OCR output.

The OCR output definitely includes "SOLD". So all unique words from the ground truth are present. Therefore, category 1 applies.
