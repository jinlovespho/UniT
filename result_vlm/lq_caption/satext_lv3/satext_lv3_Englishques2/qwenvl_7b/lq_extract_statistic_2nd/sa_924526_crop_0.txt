gt_text: Hilton
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Hilton" in large, bold letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Hilton". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'Hilton' in large, bold letters."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "The image contains the word 'Hilton' in large, bold letters." But the task says to extract the text content, which probably means focusing on the actual words present. However, the instruction for step 2 says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Hilton".

Now, looking at the OCR output, the word "Hilton" is present. The other words like "The", "image", "contains", "word", "in", "large", "bold", "letters" are part of the OCR's description but not part of the ground truth. Since the ground truth is only "Hilton", the OCR output includes "Hilton" exactly as in the ground truth. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should ignore case, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. In this case, there's no typo; "Hilton" is spelled correctly in the OCR output. The other words in the OCR output are irrelevant because the ground truth only has "Hilton". 

Since the OCR output contains the exact word "Hilton" (which is the only unique word in the ground truth), this would fall under category 1: Correct. Even though the OCR output has more words, the key is that all unique ground truth words (just "Hilton") are present. The other words in the OCR output don't affect the comparison because the ground truth only has one word. 

So the answer should be category 1.
