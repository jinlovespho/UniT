gt_text: 11
vlm_output: The image shows a blurry view of what appears to be a train station platform with several signs. The most prominent sign reads "11" in large numbers, which could indicate a platform number. There is also some smaller text that is not clearly legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, the ground truth is "11". The OCR output mentions "the most prominent sign reads '11' in large numbers". So the OCR output does include the text "11", which is exactly the ground truth. 

Now, looking at the steps: Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has the words "11" in it. Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, only unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "11". The OCR output has "11" as well. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth is just "11", and the OCR output includes that, it should be category 1. The other parts of the OCR output like "blurry view", "train station platform", etc., are irrelevant here. The key is that the OCR correctly identified "11" even though there's other text. Also, the instructions say to ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. Here, there's no typo, so it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
