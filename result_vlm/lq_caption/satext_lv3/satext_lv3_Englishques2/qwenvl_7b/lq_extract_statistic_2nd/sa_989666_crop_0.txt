gt_text: COTTAGE MINT
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, the ground truth text is "COTTAGE MINT". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is too blurry to read any text. So the extracted text from the OCR is that entire sentence.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring word order, capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has two unique words: "COTTAGE" and "MINT". Now, looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters". None of these words are "COTTAGE" or "MINT", even when considering case insensitivity. 

The OCR output is stating that the text couldn't be discerned, which implies that it didn't recognize any text. Since the ground truth words aren't present in the OCR output, and there's no mention of any words that could be typos of "COTTAGE" or "MINT", the comparison would result in no matches. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1 is for all unique ground truth words appearing in the OCR output.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated/empty.

In this case, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, and the output is unrelated (it's explaining the image is blurry, not providing the text). Therefore, the correct category is 3.
