gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "NANTES".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "NANTES". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'NANTES'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main part here is "NANTES" inside quotes. The rest is just descriptive text, so the actual extracted text is "NANTES".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is also "NANTES". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output has the same word. 

We need to ignore capitalization, but both are all caps. There are no extra spaces or punctuation to worry about here. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth word. So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. Even if there were small typos, they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. So the answer should be 1.
