vlm_output: The image contains the word "HOLLYWOOD" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'HOLLYWOOD' in large, bold letters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "HOLLYWOOD" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "HOLLYWOOD".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same word. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both cases, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has that same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here. There's no typo in the OCR output; it's exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (which is just one) are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
