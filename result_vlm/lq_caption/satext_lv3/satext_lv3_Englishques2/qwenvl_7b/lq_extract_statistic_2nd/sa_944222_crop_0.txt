gt_text: PILOTS
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "PILOTS".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "PILOTS", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image reads 'PILOTS'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "PILOTS" in quotes. So the extracted text here is "PILOTS".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "PILOTS". Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one word, "PILOTS", we check if that word is present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, the extracted text is exactly "PILOTS", which matches the ground truth. The rules also mention that we should ignore capitalization, but in this case, both are uppercase. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos because the OCR output has the exact word.

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "PILOTS") are present in the OCR output, this falls under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The OCR output correctly identified the word, even though it was part of a larger sentence. The key is that the extracted text from the OCR output is exactly the ground truth word. So the answer should be category 1.
