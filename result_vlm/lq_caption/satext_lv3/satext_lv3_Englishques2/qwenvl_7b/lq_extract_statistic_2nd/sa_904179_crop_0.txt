gt_text: STUDENT CENTER
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "STUDENT CENTER".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "STUDENT CENTER" and a VLM OCR output that says "The visible English text in the image reads 'STUDENT CENTER'." 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the text "STUDENT CENTER" within quotes. So the extracted text would be "STUDENT CENTER" because that's the actual text captured by the OCR, even though the surrounding words are part of the OCR's description.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "STUDENT CENTER" as well. The comparison rules state that word order doesn't matter, we should consider only the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at both texts, the extracted text from OCR is exactly the same as the ground truth. Both have the words "STUDENT" and "CENTER". Since the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly, even though there's additional text around it in the OCR output, the extracted text is the same. Therefore, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There are no typos, and the words are in the correct order, but even if they weren't, the order doesn't matter here. Since everything matches perfectly, the answer should be category 1.
