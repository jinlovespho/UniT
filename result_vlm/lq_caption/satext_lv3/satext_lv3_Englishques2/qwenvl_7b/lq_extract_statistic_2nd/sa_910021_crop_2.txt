gt_text: HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A" and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement about the image being blurry and not having clear text. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "HEUNG" repeated three times with hyphens and a final "A". But the OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. The OCR output is talking about the image quality and inability to read text, which is unrelated to the actual content of the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but the unique words in the ground truth are "HEUNG" and "A" (since "HEUNG-" might be considered as part of the word, but maybe the hyphens are ignored? Wait, the ground truth is "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A". So splitting by spaces, it's three instances of "HEUNG-" and one "HEUNG-A". But when considering unique words, perhaps "HEUNG" and "A" are the key parts. But the OCR output doesn't have any of these words. The OCR output mentions "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters" – none of which are related to "HEUNG" or "A".

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, even considering typos or case, the category would be 3 – Incorrect. There's no match at all. The OCR output is completely unrelated, just explaining that the image is blurry and text can't be read, which doesn't provide any of the required words.
