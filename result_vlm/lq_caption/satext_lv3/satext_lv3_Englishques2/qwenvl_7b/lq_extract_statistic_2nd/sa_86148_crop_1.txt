gt_text: XCELSIOR
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "XCELSIOR". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "XCELSIOR". Let's check if that's a word. Wait, "XCELSIOR" might be a typo or a specific term. But in the OCR output, there's no mention of "XCELSIOR" or any similar word. The OCR output is saying that no text was recognized, so it's not providing any words. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "XCELSIOR". The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters". None of these match "XCELSIOR" even if we consider typos. Since the OCR output didn't recognize any text, there's no word that could be considered a match for "XCELSIOR". 

So according to the categories: Category 3 is when there are no words matching or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output didn't find any text, and the ground truth is a specific word not present, the answer should be 3.
