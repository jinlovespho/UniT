gt_text: JDA HB- HB-JDA
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "JDA HB- HB-JDA". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output here isn't actually extracting any text; it's stating that no text was found.

The ground truth has the words "JDA", "HB-", "HB-JDA". The OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. Instead, it's saying there's no clear text. So the OCR output is not providing any words that match the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth, and instead says there's no text, that's category 3. The output is largely wrong or unrelated because it's not even attempting to provide the text that's present in the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
