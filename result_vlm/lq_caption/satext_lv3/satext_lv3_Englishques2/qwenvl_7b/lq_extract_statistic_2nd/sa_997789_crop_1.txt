gt_text: PONANT
vlm_output: The image contains the word "PONANT" in capital letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PONANT", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'PONANT' in capital letters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "PONANT" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "PONANT".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "PONANT", which is a single word. The OCR output's extracted text is the same word. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PONANT". The OCR output has "PONANT" as well. 

We need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one word, and it's exactly the same (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), it's a match. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. Here, there are no typos, so it's a perfect match.

Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1: Correct.
