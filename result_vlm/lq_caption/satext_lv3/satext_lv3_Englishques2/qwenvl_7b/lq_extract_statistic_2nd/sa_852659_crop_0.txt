Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text. The ground truth is "TECHNOPARK POMERANIA CONSILEON" and the OCR output is "The image contains the word 'Sushi' in English."

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence, but the main text content is "Sushi." The rest is just a description of the image, so the actual extracted text would be "Sushi."

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has three words: TECHNOPARK, POMERANIA, and CONSILEON. The OCR output has "Sushi." Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the words: TECHNOPARK, POMERANIA, CONSILEON. None of these are similar to "Sushi." There's no overlap in words. Even if we consider case insensitivity, "sushi" doesn't match any of the ground truth words. Also, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since there are no matches here, the answer should be category 3.
