gt_text: demande permis DRIVE construire ICI de de L E.Leclerc Leclerc
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "E Leclerc DRIVE".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to compare the OCR output from a VLM with the ground truth text and categorize the result as 1, 2, or 3 based on specific criteria. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The given OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'E Leclerc DRIVE'." So the extracted text here is "E Leclerc DRIVE". 

Next, the ground truth text is "demande permis DRIVE construire ICI de de L E.Leclerc Leclerc". I need to process this ground truth to get the unique words, ignoring case, punctuation, and extra spaces. Let me break it down:

Original ground truth: "demande permis DRIVE construire ICI de de L E.Leclerc Leclerc"

First, I'll split the words, removing any punctuation. The word "E.Leclerc" has a period, so I should split that into "E" and "Leclerc" or treat it as "E.Leclerc"? Wait, the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so maybe split on spaces and then remove punctuation from each word. But "E.Leclerc" would become "E Leclerc" if we split on the period. Hmm, but the original ground truth has "de de L E.Leclerc Leclerc". Let me process each word:

- "demande" → "demande"
- "permis" → "permis"
- "DRIVE" → "drive"
- "construire" → "construire"
- "ICI" → "ici"
- "de" → "de"
- "de" → "de"
- "L" → "l"
- "E.Leclerc" → "e" and "leclerc" (splitting on the period)
- "Leclerc" → "leclerc"

So the unique words from the ground truth, ignoring case and punctuation, are: demande, permis, drive, construire, ici, de, l, e, leclerc.

Now, the OCR output is "E Leclerc DRIVE". Let's process that similarly. Split into words: "E", "Leclerc", "DRIVE". Converting to lowercase: e, leclerc, drive.

Now, compare the unique words from OCR output with the ground truth set. The OCR has e, leclerc, drive. The ground truth has e, leclerc, drive, demande, permis, construire, ici, de, l. 

So the OCR output matches the words e, leclerc, and drive from the ground truth. The other words (demande, permis, construire, ici, de, l) are not present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, only three words match, not all.
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match. That's the case here.
- Category 3: No words match or output is wrong. Not applicable here.

So the answer should be category 2.
