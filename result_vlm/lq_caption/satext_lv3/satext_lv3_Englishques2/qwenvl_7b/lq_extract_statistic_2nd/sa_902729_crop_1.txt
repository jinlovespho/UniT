gt_text: Keep clear
vlm_output: The image shows a sign with some text that appears to be in English. The text is partially obscured and blurry, but it seems to include the word "STOP" at the top, followed by other words that are not clearly legible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Keep clear," and the VLM OCR output is a description of an image with a sign that has some text. The OCR output mentions the word "STOP" at the top and other words that are not clearly legible due to blurriness.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says the text includes "STOP" and other words that are not clearly legible. But the actual ground truth is "Keep clear." 

Now, comparing the extracted text from the OCR output with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are "Keep" and "clear." The OCR output mentions "STOP" but doesn't mention "Keep" or "clear." The other words are not legible, so they might not be relevant here. 

Considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Keep" and "clear" aren't in the OCR output, and the only word mentioned is "STOP," which isn't part of the ground truth, there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none. Here, none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. So the category should be 3.
