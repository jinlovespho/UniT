gt_text: HYBRID4
vlm_output: The image contains the word "HYBRID4" in a stylized font.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "HYBRID4". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'HYBRID4' in a stylized font." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "HYBRID4" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "HYBRID4".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. Let's break down the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both have only one word, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HYBRID4".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output uses "HYBRID4" which is the same as the ground truth in terms of letters and case. No punctuation or spaces to consider here.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos in this case.

So, the OCR output contains the exact word "HYBRID4" as in the ground truth. Therefore, all unique words in the ground truth (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1.
- Category 2 would be if at least one but not all matched. But here all (the only one) matched.
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated content. That's not the case here.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
