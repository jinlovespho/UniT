gt_text: AIRWAYS DE
vlm_output: The image shows a blurry view of an aircraft with some text and numbers on its side. The text appears to be "KOSMOS" in large letters, followed by smaller text that is not clearly legible due to the blurriness. There are also some numbers below the text, but they are not fully visible.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "AIRWAYS DE" and a VLM OCR output that describes an image with some text. The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KOSMOS" in large letters and some smaller text that's not clearly legible. The numbers below are also not fully visible. So the extracted text from the OCR would be "KOSMOS" and some other text that's unclear. However, the problem says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Wait, but the OCR output is a description of the image, not the actual text extracted from the image. Hmm, maybe I need to parse the OCR output to find any text that's mentioned. The OCR output says the text appears to be "KOSMOS" followed by smaller text that's not legible. So the only clear word mentioned is "KOSMOS". The rest is not legible. So the extracted text would be "KOSMOS" and possibly some other words that are not clear, but since they are not legible, maybe they are not considered. Wait, the instruction says Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the OCR output is a description of what's in the image. The actual text in the image is "KOSMOS" and some other text that's not legible. But the OCR output's text content would be the words mentioned in the description. So the OCR output's text is "KOSMOS", and the rest is about the blurriness. So the extracted text is "KOSMOS".

Now, compare that with the ground truth "AIRWAYS DE". The unique words in the ground truth are "AIRWAYS" and "DE". The OCR output's extracted text is "KOSMOS". So none of the words "AIRWAYS" or "DE" are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it would be category 3. But wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "AIRWAYS" and "DE". The OCR output has "KOSMOS" as the only clear word. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, the answer is category 3.
