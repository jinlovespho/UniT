vlm_output: The image shows a vehicle with a sign that includes the word "Taxi" in English.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The ground truth text is "8237 HYL", and the VLM OCR output is "The image shows a vehicle with a sign that includes the word 'Taxi' in English." My job is to compare these two based on specific criteria and categorize the result into one of three categories: 1 (correct), 2 (partially correct), or 3 (incorrect).

Starting with Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence. Let me list them out: "The", "image", "shows", "a", "vehicle", "with", "a", "sign", "that", "includes", "the", "word", "Taxi", "in", "English."

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "8237 HYL". Let's break down the unique words in the ground truth. The words here are "8237" and "HYL". Wait, but "8237" is a number, and "HYL" is an abbreviation or maybe a word. However, the OCR output doesn't mention any numbers or the letters HYL. The OCR output talks about a vehicle, a sign, the word "Taxi", etc.

The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in the ground truth are "8237" and "HYL". Now, I need to check if these words appear in the OCR output. But looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of "8237" or "HYL". The OCR output mentions "Taxi" and other words related to the image description.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). Here, the ground truth words are "8237" and "HYL". The OCR output doesn't have either of these. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The next category is 2 if at least one but not all unique words match. But in this case, there are zero matches. So that would fall under category 3: Incorrect, because no words match, and the output is unrelated. The OCR output is describing an image with a taxi sign, which is unrelated to the ground truth text which is a number and an abbreviation. 

I should also check if there's any possibility of typos or different forms. For example, maybe "HYL" is misspelled as something else in the OCR output. But looking at the OCR output, there's no "HYL" or similar. The only word that might be close is "Taxi", but that's not related. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
