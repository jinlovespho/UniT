gt_text: STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text.

First, the ground truth text is "STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER". The unique words here are "STOLARZ", "BENJAMIN", and "HOLCER". 

Next, the OCR output mentions "HOLCER" in large letters, "BENJAMIN" above it, and "STOLARZ" below. So the extracted text from the OCR would be "HOLCER", "BENJAMIN", and "STOLARZ". 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, so even if they're in a different order, it's okay. The OCR has all three words. The ground truth words are all present in the OCR output. The OCR might have the words in a different order (HOLCER, then BENJAMIN, then STOLARZ), but since order doesn't matter, that's fine. Also, capitalization is ignored, and there are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output has all three unique words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words are present, it should be category 1.
