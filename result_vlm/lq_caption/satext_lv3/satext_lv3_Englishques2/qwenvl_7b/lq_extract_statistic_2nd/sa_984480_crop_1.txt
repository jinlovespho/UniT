Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "HOTEL VILLE DE". The OCR output from the VLM says it's a building with a sign that includes "MUNICIPALITE" and some other French characters, but the text is blurry.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "MUNICIPALITE" and some other French words, but the actual text extracted would be "MUNICIPALITE" and maybe other words. However, the problem says to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth, which are "HOTEL", "VILLE", and "DE".

Now, comparing the OCR output's text to these words. The OCR output mentions "MUNICIPALITE" but not "HOTEL", "VILLE", or "DE". The other characters are in French but not the specific words from the ground truth. Since none of the required words are present in the OCR output, even considering typos, case, etc., the category would be 3 because there's no match for the ground truth words.
