gt_text: G550
vlm_output: The image is very blurry, but it appears to show part of a vehicle with some text on it. The text seems to be in a non-English script and is not clearly legible due to the blurriness. There is no visible English text in the image.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "G550". The VLM OCR output says that the image is blurry, there's part of a vehicle with some text in a non-English script, which isn't clearly legible, and there's no English text visible.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "text" but says it's in a non-English script and not legible. There's no mention of any specific letters or numbers like "G550". 

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "G550", which is a specific string. The OCR output doesn't mention any letters or numbers. The OCR says there's text, but it's not legible. So the OCR didn't recognize the text, so there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output. The ground truth is "G550" which is a single word. The OCR output doesn't have that word. It says there's text but can't read it. So the OCR didn't find the correct text. Therefore, category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match. The OCR output doesn't have "G550" or any part of it. Even if there's a typo, but the OCR didn't recognize any text, so there's no match. So the answer should be 3.
