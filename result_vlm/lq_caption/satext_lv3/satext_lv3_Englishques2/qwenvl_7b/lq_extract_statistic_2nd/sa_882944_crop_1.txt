gt_text: SPORTAGE
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "SPORTAGE".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'SPORTAGE'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text they're referring to is "SPORTAGE" in quotes. So the extracted text would be "SPORTAGE".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is also "SPORTAGE". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. Since both have only one word, "SPORTAGE", and the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), even though the OCR output has extra text around it, the key is that the actual text extracted is the same.

Wait, but the step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So maybe the OCR output is the entire sentence, but the actual text they extracted is "SPORTAGE". So the extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth. Therefore, all unique words (just "SPORTAGE") are present. So category 1 would be correct.

I think that's right. Even though the OCR output includes extra words like "The", "visible", etc., the step 1 is to extract the text content, which in this case is "SPORTAGE" as per the OCR output. So the comparison is between "SPORTAGE" and "SPORTAGE", which is a perfect match. So category 1.
