gt_text: UQAM
vlm_output: The image contains a blurry view of a building with some windows and what appears to be a sign or part of a sign that includes the letters "C" and possibly "O" or "A". The rest of the text is not clear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "UQAM". The VLM OCR output mentions letters "C" and possibly "O" or "A". The rest is blurry and unclear.

First, step 1: Extract text content from OCR. The OCR output has "C", "O" or "A". But the actual ground truth is "UQAM". Let's see the letters in UQAM: U, Q, A, M. The OCR output mentions C, O, A. So the only overlapping letter is A. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word "UQAM", so the unique words are just "UQAM". But the OCR output doesn't have "UQAM" at all. However, the OCR output mentions "C", "O", or "A". Wait, maybe I need to check if the OCR output contains any of the letters in the ground truth. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "UQAM", which is one word. So the unique words in ground truth is {"UQAM"}. The OCR output's extracted text is "C", "O", or "A". So the OCR output doesn't have the word "UQAM" in it. However, maybe the OCR output is trying to describe parts of the sign, like letters C, O, A. But the ground truth is "UQAM", which includes letters U, Q, A, M. The OCR output has A, but not the others. However, the instruction says to compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "UQAM", and the OCR output doesn't have that word, but maybe the OCR output is trying to capture letters from the sign. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must have the same words as the ground truth. But the OCR output doesn't have "UQAM", it's talking about letters C, O, A. So that would be category 3, since no words match. But wait, the OCR output says "sign or part of a sign that includes the letters 'C' and possibly 'O' or 'A'". So the OCR output is trying to describe letters present in the sign. But the ground truth is the name of the sign, which is "UQAM". The OCR output is not recognizing the full name but is mentioning some letters. However, according to the instructions, we need to compare the extracted text (from OCR) with the ground truth. The extracted text from OCR is "C", "O", "A". The ground truth is "UQAM". Since none of the letters in the OCR output match the letters in the ground truth except for A, but the OCR output is not a word that matches "UQAM". Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain the ground truth word. Hence, category 3.
