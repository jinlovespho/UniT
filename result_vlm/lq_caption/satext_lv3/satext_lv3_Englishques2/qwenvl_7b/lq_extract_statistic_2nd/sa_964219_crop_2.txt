gt_text: HEAD
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "HEAD".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "HEAD". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is "HEAD"." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the visible text is "HEAD", so the extracted text here is "HEAD".

Now step 2: compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "HEAD". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "HEAD", which matches the ground truth. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. We check unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HEAD". The OCR output's extracted text also has "HEAD". 

Capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces. No typos either. So all conditions are met. 

Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present. Since "HEAD" is present, it's category 1.
