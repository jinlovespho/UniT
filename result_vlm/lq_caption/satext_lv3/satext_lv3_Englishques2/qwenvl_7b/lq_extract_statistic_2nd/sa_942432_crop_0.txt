gt_text: FARNESIVS
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters. It appears to show part of a building with architectural details and possibly a statue in the foreground, but no readable text is present.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text, which is "FARNESIVS", and an OCR output from a VLM that says the image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters. Then there are specific steps to follow for comparison.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing the image as blurry with no readable text. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "FARNESIVS", which looks like a Latin name, possibly a person's name. The OCR output doesn't mention any text at all; it says there's no readable text present. 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're only comparing the set of unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "FARNESIVS". The OCR output has words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters", "building", "architectural", "details", "statue", "foreground", "readable". None of these words match "FARNESIVS". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is wrong. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, even considering typos or case, it's category 3. The OCR says there's no text, so it's not even close to the actual text which is present in the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
