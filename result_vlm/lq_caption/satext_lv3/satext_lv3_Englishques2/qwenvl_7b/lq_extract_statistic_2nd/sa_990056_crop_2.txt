gt_text: EI-DEC
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SAL" in white letters against a green background.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "EI-DEC" and a VLM OCR output that says "The image contains the word 'SAL' in white letters against a green background." The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SAL". The ground truth is "EI-DEC". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "EI-DEC", which is a single word. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "EI-DEC".

Next, the OCR output has the word "SAL". Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "EI-DEC" and "SAL" are different words. There's no overlap here. Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and typos. But in this case, the words themselves are entirely different. There's no typo that would make "SAL" match "EI-DEC" even with some letter changes. For example, "EI-DEC" has letters E, I, D, E, C. "SAL" is S, A, L. No letters in common. So even with typos, they don't match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has "SAL" and the ground truth is "EI-DEC", there's no match. Therefore, the category would be 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. Even though the OCR output is about an image, the actual text content doesn't include any of the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
