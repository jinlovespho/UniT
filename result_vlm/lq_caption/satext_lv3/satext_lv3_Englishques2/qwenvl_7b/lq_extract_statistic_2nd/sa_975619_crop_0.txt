gt_text: CENTER MEDICAL
vlm_output: The image contains the word "SUN" in large, bold letters.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CENTER MEDICAL". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the word 'SUN' in large, bold letters."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "SUN". So the extracted text is just "SUN".

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CENTER" and "MEDICAL". The OCR output has "SUN". 

The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, spacing, etc. But "SUN" doesn't match either "CENTER" or "MEDICAL" even if we consider typos. There's no overlap here. 

So according to the categories: category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output has "SUN" which isn't related to the ground truth words, it's category 3.
