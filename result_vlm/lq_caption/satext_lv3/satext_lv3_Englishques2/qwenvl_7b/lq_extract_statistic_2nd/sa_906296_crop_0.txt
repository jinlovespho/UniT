gt_text: 86 23 39
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "86 23 39". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Now step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has three numbers: 86, 23, 39. The OCR output doesn't have any numbers; it's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read any text. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "86", "23", "39". But the OCR output doesn't have any of these numbers. The OCR output mentions words like "image", "blurry", "discern", "clear", "English", "text", "characters" — none of which are the numbers from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). But here, none of the numbers are present. The OCR output is saying it can't read any text, so it's not providing the numbers. Therefore, there are no matches. 

So according to category 3: Incorrect, because no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth numbers, as it's stating the image is too blurry to read anything. So the answer should be 3.
