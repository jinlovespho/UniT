gt_text: PEREYRA FLIA
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "PEREYRA FLIA". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "PEREYRA" and "FLIA". The OCR output doesn't mention either of these words. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read any text. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output doesn't have "PEREYRA" or "FLIA" in any form. It's not even close. The OCR output is stating that no text was recognized, so there's no match for the ground truth words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match (which isn't the case here), 2 if at least one matches (but none do), and 3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is entirely unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, the category should be 3.
