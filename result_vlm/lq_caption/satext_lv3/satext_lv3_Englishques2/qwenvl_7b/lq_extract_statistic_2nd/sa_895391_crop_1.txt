gt_text: Cervantes
vlm_output: The image shows a blurry section of a building with some visible text. The text appears to be "curtains" but is not entirely clear due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "Cervantes". The VLM OCR output says the text is "curtains" but it's blurry. So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "curtains" as the visible text.

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "Cervantes". The unique words in the ground truth are just "Cervantes". The OCR output has "curtains". Let's check if they match. The rules say to ignore case, so "curtains" vs "Cervantes" – they are different words. Even with typos, they don't look similar. "Curtains" and "Cervantes" don't share any common letters in the same order. So there's no match here. 

The categories: 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But here, there's no match. So it's category 3 – incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
