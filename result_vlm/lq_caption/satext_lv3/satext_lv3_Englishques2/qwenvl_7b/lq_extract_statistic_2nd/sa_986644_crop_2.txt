gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "FRUIT".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the ground truth text is "FRUIT". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'FRUIT'." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the word "FRUIT" in quotes. So the extracted text would be "The visible English text in the image is 'FRUIT'." But maybe the task is to extract the actual text that was recognized, which in this case is "FRUIT". Wait, the instruction says "Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the VLM OCR output is the entire sentence, but the actual text recognized is "FRUIT" as per the output. So maybe the extracted text is "FRUIT" because that's what the OCR detected. But the exact wording of the OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'FRUIT'." So perhaps the extracted text is the entire sentence, but the user wants us to extract the actual text that was recognized, which is "FRUIT". 

Wait, the problem says "Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the OCR output is a statement that includes the recognized text. So the VLM OCR output is the sentence "The visible English text in the image is 'FRUIT'." So the text content here would be the entire sentence, but the actual recognized text is "FRUIT". However, the problem might be that the VLM OCR output is the sentence, and the task is to extract the text that was recognized. But maybe the user wants to extract the actual text that was detected, which is "FRUIT" in this case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the OCR output is the sentence, and the task is to extract the text that is present in the OCR output. So the OCR output includes the text "FRUIT" as part of its statement. Therefore, the extracted text would be "FRUIT". But I need to be precise here. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The ground truth text is "FRUIT". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English text in the image is 'FRUIT'." Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "FRUIT" as the recognized content. Therefore, the extracted text would be "FRUIT" because that's the actual text detected. However, if the extraction is done by taking all the text in the OCR output, it would be the entire sentence. But the problem says "text content", which might refer to the actual recognized text, not the surrounding explanation. 

But maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let's think: the OCR output is the sentence that includes the recognized text. So the VLM OCR output is a statement that says the image contains the text "FRUIT". Therefore, the extracted text from the OCR output is "FRUIT", which is the same as the ground truth. 

Now, moving to step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "FRUIT". The OCR output's extracted text is "FRUIT". So they are exactly the same. However, the instructions mention that word order does not matter, but in this case, there's only one word. Also, they compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "FRUIT", and the OCR output also has "FRUIT", then all unique words match. 

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The ground truth is "FRUIT" (all caps), and the OCR output's extracted text is "FRUIT" (same as ground truth). So capitalization is the same here. No punctuation or spaces to consider. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Therefore, all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Hence, the category is 1 — Correct.
