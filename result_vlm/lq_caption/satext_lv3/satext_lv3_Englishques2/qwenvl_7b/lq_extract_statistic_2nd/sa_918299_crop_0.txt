gt_text: S32 32
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters. It appears to show an airport scene with a plane and some structures, but no legible text is present.

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "S32 32". The VLM OCR output says the image is too blurry and there's no legible text. 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that there's no clear English text or characters. So the extracted text here is about the image being blurry and no text present.

Step 2 is comparing that extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "S32" and "32". Now, the OCR output doesn't mention any text at all; it says there's no legible text. So the OCR output isn't recognizing the "S32 32" as text. 

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "S32" and "32" as unique words. The OCR output doesn't have any of these words. It's saying there's no text, so it's not matching any of the words from the ground truth. 

Even if we consider that maybe the OCR output is trying to say there's no text, which is the opposite of the ground truth, but the words themselves are not present. So according to the criteria, if none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated or empty in terms of the actual text content. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
