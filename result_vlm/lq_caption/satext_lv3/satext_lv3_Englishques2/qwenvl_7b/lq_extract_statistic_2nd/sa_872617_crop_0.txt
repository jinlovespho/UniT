gt_text: 40 40
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "40".

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "40 40". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible text in the image is '40'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "40" as the visible text. So the extracted text here is just "40".

Now step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of "40", but the OCR only found one. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "40". The OCR output has "40" as well. 

The criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should ignore case, punctuation, and spacing. Since both have "40", even though the ground truth has two of them, the unique words are the same. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (since "40" is present). Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words are present, the answer should be 1.
