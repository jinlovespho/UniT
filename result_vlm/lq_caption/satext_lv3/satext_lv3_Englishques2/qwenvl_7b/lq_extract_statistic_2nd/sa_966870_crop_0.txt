gt_text: DB
vlm_output: The image contains the letters "DB" in red and white.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DB". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the letters "DB" in red and white."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "DB" explicitly. So the extracted text would include "DB" as part of the sentence.

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has the unique word "DB". The OCR output has "DB" in it. The instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "DB", we check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

The OCR output has "DB" exactly as in the ground truth. Even though there are other words like "image", "contains", "letters", "red", "and", "white", the key is that "DB" is present. The comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth, which is just "DB". 

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, and we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, the OCR output has "DB" exactly as the ground truth. There's no typo mentioned here. So "DB" is a perfect match. 

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just "DB") are present in the OCR output. So according to category 1, it's correct. The answer should be 1.
