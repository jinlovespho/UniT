Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BUT", and the VLM OCR output is "The image shows the word "BUT" in white capital letters against a red background. The image is blurry, making it difficult to discern finer details."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a description of an image, but the main text mentioned here is "BUT". The rest of the text describes the image's attributes like color, blurriness, etc.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "BUT". The OCR output includes the word "BUT" exactly as it is, in capital letters. According to the guidelines, word order doesn't matter, and we should consider unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "BUT", and the OCR output contains that exact word, even though there are other words around it, the key is whether the unique words from the ground truth are present.

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, but here both are in capital letters. Also, typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. The OCR output correctly includes "BUT". Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just "BUT") are present in the OCR output. 

So, according to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
