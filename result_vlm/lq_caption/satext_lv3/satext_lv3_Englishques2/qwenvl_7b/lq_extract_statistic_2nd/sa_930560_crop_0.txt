gt_text: 15
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any visible English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "15", and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to discern any visible English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be seen. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number "15". The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. The words in the OCR output are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "visible", "English", "text", "or", "characters". 

The unique words in the ground truth are "15". Wait, but "15" is a number, not a word. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth is "15", which is a number. However, the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. It talks about text, but the actual number isn't present.

So, the OCR output doesn't have the word "15" or any form of it. The OCR says there's no visible text, so it's not even trying to extract the number. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "15") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention the number 15 at all and instead says there's no text, it's unrelated. So the answer should be category 3.
