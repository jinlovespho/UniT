gt_text: Murray Murray
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Murray Murray," and the VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence stating that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text here is that entire sentence.

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Murray" repeated twice. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique word here is just "Murray."

Now, I need to check if "Murray" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters," but not "Murray." There's no mention of the name Murray at all. The OCR output is stating that no text can be discerned, which implies that it didn't detect any words, including "Murray."

Considering the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Murray" isn't in the OCR output, this isn't the case.
- Category 2 is if at least one unique word matches. But there are no matches here.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is unrelated because it's saying there's no text, which contradicts the ground truth. So, it's category 3.

Wait, but the OCR output is saying it can't discern any text, which might mean that it's not detecting the text, but the ground truth is "Murray Murray." So the OCR output isn't providing any text, so there's no match. Therefore, it's category 3.
