gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: The image shows a portion of a building with the letters "UIT" visible at the top. The text appears to be part of a larger word or name, but the full context is not clear due to the blurriness and partial view.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "UIT". The VLM OCR output is a description that mentions the letters "UIT" visible at the top. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The relevant part here is the mention of "UIT". The rest of the description talks about the image and the blurriness, but the actual text extracted should be "UIT".

Next, comparing the extracted text "UIT" with the ground truth "UIT". Since the ground truth is just the word "UIT", and the OCR output also includes "UIT", they match exactly. 

The rules say to consider unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UIT". The OCR output has "UIT" as well. Even though the OCR output has more text, the key is that the unique word from the ground truth is present. 

Also, the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should ignore case, punctuation, and spacing. Here, both are the same. There are no typos mentioned, so that's a match. 

So, according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "UIT") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
