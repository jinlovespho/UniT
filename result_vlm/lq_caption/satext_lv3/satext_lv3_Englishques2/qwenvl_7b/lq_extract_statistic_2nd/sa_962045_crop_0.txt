Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NESSELBECK". The VLM OCR output says the image contains blurry Chinese characters and no visible English text.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Chinese characters" and states there's "no visible English text". So the extracted text here is about the presence of Chinese characters and absence of English text.

Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is the name "NESSELBECK", which is an English name. The OCR output claims there's no English text, which directly contradicts the ground truth. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we look at unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NESSELBECK". The OCR output doesn't mention this word at all. It talks about Chinese characters and absence of English text. Even if we consider typos or case, the OCR output doesn't have any mention of the name. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since the OCR output doesn't mention "NESSELBECK" or any part of it, there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3.
