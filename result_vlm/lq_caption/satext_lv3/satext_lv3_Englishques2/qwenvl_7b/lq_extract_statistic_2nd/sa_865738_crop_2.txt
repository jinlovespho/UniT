gt_text: 7122 NS GP60 712
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "7122".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "7122 NS GP60 712". The OCR output from the VLM is "The visible text in the image is '7122'." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So, the OCR output mentions "7122" as the visible text. The rest of the sentence like "The visible text in the image is" is probably not part of the actual extracted text, right? Wait, the problem says to extract the text content, but the example given in the OCR output includes the entire sentence. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the OCR output is supposed to be the raw text, which in this case is "The visible text in the image is '7122'." But the ground truth is just the numbers and abbreviations.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So, perhaps the OCR output is the entire sentence, but the actual text content they want is the part that's the OCR result. But the example given here is "The visible text in the image is '7122'." So maybe the OCR output is that entire sentence, and the extracted text would be the part that's the OCR result, which is "7122". But I'm not sure. Let me re-read the problem.

The VLM OCR output is given as "The visible text in the image is '7122'." So that's the entire output. Now, step 1 is to extract the text content from this. But the text content here is the part that's the OCR result. However, the way the problem is phrased, maybe the OCR output is the entire sentence, and the actual text content is the numbers. But that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is the raw OCR text, which in this case is "The visible text in the image is '7122'." So the extracted text would be that entire string. But the ground truth is "7122 NS GP60 712". 

Wait, the problem says: "Compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering..." So the extracted text from the OCR output is the entire sentence "The visible text in the image is '7122'." But the ground truth is "7122 NS GP60 712". So, when comparing, we need to look at the words in the OCR output. The OCR output's text is "The visible text in the image is '7122'." So the words here are "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "7122". The ground truth has "7122", "NS", "GP60", "712".

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter. Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are "7122", "NS", "GP60", "712". The OCR output's unique words are "The", "visible", "text", "in", "image", "is", "7122". 

So, the OCR output only has "7122" from the ground truth. The other words like NS, GP60, 712 are not present. So, according to the categories: category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the four is present. So category 2 is at least one but not all. So the answer should be 2. But wait, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in the OCR output, the text is "7122" which is the same as in the ground truth. The other words are not present. So the OCR output has only one of the four unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2.
