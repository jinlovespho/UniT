gt_text: OLIVER
vlm_output: The image shows a blurry stone archway with some greenery around it. There is a sign above the arch that appears to have the word "LIVELI" partially visible, but the rest of the text is obscured and not clear enough to read fully.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "OLIVER". The VLM OCR output mentions a sign with "LIVELI" partially visible. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The relevant part here is "LIVELI". Now, comparing this to the ground truth "OLIVER". 

Looking at the words, the ground truth has "OLIVER" and the OCR has "LIVELI". Let's check for matches. If we ignore case, "LIVELI" vs "OLIVER". The letters are similar but not exact. "LIVELI" is missing the 'O' and has an extra 'L' and 'I' instead of 'ER' at the end. However, the problem says small typos still count as matches. But wait, does "LIVELI" contain any parts of "OLIVER"? Let's see: "OLIVER" has O, L, I, V, E, R. The OCR's "LIVELI" has L, I, V, E, L, I. So, the letters L, I, V, E are present. But the ground truth is a single word "OLIVER", and the OCR output has "LIVELI". Since the OCR's text is a single word, but it's not exactly "OLIVER". However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OLIVER". The OCR output has "LIVELI" as a word. 

But considering that "LIVELI" is a typo of "OLIVER"? Well, "LIVELI" is not a correct spelling of "OLIVER". However, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. Wait, but does "LIVELI" contain all the letters of "OLIVER"? No. "OLIVER" has O, L, I, V, E, R. "LIVELI" has L, I, V, E, L, I. Missing the O and R, and has extra L and I. So maybe it's not a small typo. But the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output is "LIVELI" which is a different word. 

Wait, the ground truth is "OLIVER" and the OCR has "LIVELI". Are they considered a match? If the OCR output had "OLIVER" but with a typo like "OLIVR" or "OLIVRE", that would be a small typo. But "LIVELI" is missing the 'O' and has different letters. So maybe it's not a small typo. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have the correct word. 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OLIVER". The OCR output has "LIVELI" as a word. Since "LIVELI" is not the same as "OLIVER" even with typos, does that count as a match? The instructions say small typos count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output's word is not even close. So maybe it's not a match. Therefore, the answer would be category 3, since no words match. Wait, but maybe "LIVELI" is considered a partial match. However, the problem says that the set of unique words in the ground truth must be present in the OCR. Since the ground truth is "OLIVER", and the OCR has "LIVELI", which isn't a match. So category 3? Or is there any overlap?

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output mentions "LIVELI" which is part of "OLIVER"? But no, "LIVELI" isn't a substring of "OLIVER". So, no match. Therefore, category 3.
