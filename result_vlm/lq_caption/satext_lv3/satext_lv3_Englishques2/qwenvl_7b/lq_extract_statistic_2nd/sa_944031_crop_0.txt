Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "105". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the number "105" in white text on a dark background."

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. So, the OCR output is a sentence that includes the number 105. The main text here is "The image contains the number "105" in white text on a dark background." But when extracting the text content, maybe we just take the actual words. Wait, the instruction says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the OCR output is the sentence, but the text content would be the words in that sentence. But the ground truth is just "105". 

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "105", which is a single number. The OCR output has "105" in it. The unique words in the ground truth are just "105". The OCR output has "105" as part of the sentence. So the unique words in the OCR output include "The", "image", "contains", "the", "number", "105", "in", "white", "text", "on", "a", "dark", "background". But the ground truth's unique words are only "105".

So according to the instructions, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "105" as the unique word. The OCR output includes "105" as one of its words. So all unique words in the ground truth (just "105") are present in the OCR output. 

The other factors: word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored, punctuation and spaces are ignored. The OCR output has "105" exactly as in the ground truth. So even though the OCR output has more words, the only unique word from the ground truth is present. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
