gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: The image contains the word "MUSEUM" in red letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'MUSEUM' in red letters." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "MUSEUM" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "MUSEUM".

Now step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "MUSEUM". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both, order isn't an issue here. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MUSEUM".

The OCR output has the same word "MUSEUM". The comparison should ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. The OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, so even if there were typos, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos.

So all unique ground truth words (just "MUSEUM") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's a correct match. The answer should be 1.
