gt_text: MISS GILL
vlm_output: The image contains the word "TUG" in large, bold letters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MISS GILL". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the word 'TUG' in large, bold letters."

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "TUG". So the extracted text is just "TUG".

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "MISS" and "GILL". The OCR output only has "TUG".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "MISS" and "GILL" aren't in "TUG". The OCR output has "TUG", which isn't part of the ground truth. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here, none are), 2 if at least one matches (but none do), and 3 if no words match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no matching words, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is about an image containing a word, the actual words don't match. So the answer should be 3.
