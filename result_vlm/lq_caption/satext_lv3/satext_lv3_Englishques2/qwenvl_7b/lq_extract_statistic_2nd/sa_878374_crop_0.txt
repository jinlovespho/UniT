gt_text: ROW MARMONT
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ROW MARMONT". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence explaining that the image is blurry and no text can be discerned. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two unique words: "ROW" and "MARMONT". Now, looking at the OCR output, the words present are "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "discern", "any", "clear", "English", "text", "or", "characters." 

Comparing these, none of the OCR words match "ROW" or "MARMONT". The OCR output is stating that no text was found, which is different from the ground truth. Since the OCR didn't detect any words, there's no match for the unique words in the ground truth. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output isn't just missing some words; it's stating that no text was discernible, which is unrelated to the actual ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
