Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MOMO MOMO cafe". The VLM OCR output says it's blurry and mentions "SINGAPORE NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY" as partially visible.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the words "SINGAPORE NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY". So the extracted text is those words.

Now, step 2 is comparing with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "MOMO", "cafe". The OCR output has "SINGAPORE", "NATIONAL", "PHARMACEUTICAL", "TECHNOLOGY". 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "MOMO" and "cafe". The OCR output doesn't have either of these words. The OCR output's words are all different. So there's no match for any of the ground truth words. 

Even if we consider typos, but the words are completely different. "MOMO" isn't in the OCR text. "Cafe" isn't there either. So according to the criteria, category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output has none of the ground truth words, it's category 3.
