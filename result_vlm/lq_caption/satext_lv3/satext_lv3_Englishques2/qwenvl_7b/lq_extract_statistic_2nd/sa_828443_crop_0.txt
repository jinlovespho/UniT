gt_text: MAXI ZOO
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image is "MAXI ZOO".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the VLM OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, the ground truth text is "MAXI ZOO". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English text in the image is 'MAXI ZOO'." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So I need to look at the OCR output and pull out the actual text mentioned. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "MAXI ZOO" within quotes. So the extracted text here is "MAXI ZOO".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "MAXI ZOO". The comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "MAXI" and "ZOO".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR had "maxi zoo" or "MAXI ZOO" with extra spaces, it's still okay.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there was a typo like "MAXI ZO", that would be a problem, but maybe "MAXI ZOO" with a minor typo would still be considered a match.

Now, looking at the OCR output's extracted text: "MAXI ZOO" exactly matches the ground truth. Both words are present, in the correct order (but order doesn't matter), same capitalization (though case is ignored), and no typos. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth ("MAXI", "ZOO") are present in the OCR output, and there are no missing words, this should fall into category 1. There's no partial match here, and the output isn't empty or unrelated. 

I need to make sure there's no trick here. The OCR output's text is exactly the same as the ground truth. So all conditions for category 1 are met.
