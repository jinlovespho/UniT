gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: The image contains the word "Nikon" in English.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the word 'Nikon' in English." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the main text here is "Nikon". The rest is just descriptive text. So the extracted text would be "Nikon" since that's the actual word mentioned.

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "Nikon". Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word, that's not an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon".

Now, checking if the OCR output contains this word. The OCR output has "Nikon" exactly as in the ground truth. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Also, there are no typos. The OCR output correctly includes the word "Nikon".

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "Nikon") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
