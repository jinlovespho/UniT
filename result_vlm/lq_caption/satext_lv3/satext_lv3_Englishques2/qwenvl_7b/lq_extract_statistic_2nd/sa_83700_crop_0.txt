vlm_output: The image is blurry and does not contain any visible English text or characters.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "COVENT GARDEN COVENT GARDEN". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is blurry and does not contain any visible English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that there's no visible text. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Now Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "COVENT" and "GARDEN". 

But the OCR output doesn't mention either of those words. Instead, it talks about the image being blurry and no text being visible. So the OCR output is stating that there's no text, which is actually correct in this case because the ground truth is the text that's supposed to be there. Wait, but the ground truth is the actual text present, and the OCR output is trying to detect it. If the OCR output says there's no text, but the ground truth has text, that would be an error. But according to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match, or the output is unrelated or empty. 

The OCR output's text doesn't contain "COVENT" or "GARDEN" at all. It's saying there's no text. So the extracted text from OCR is completely different. Therefore, the category would be 3 because there are no matches. The OCR output is not even mentioning the words, so it's incorrect. Even though the OCR might be correct in that the image is blurry (maybe the image was actually blurry), the task here is to check if the OCR output's text matches the ground truth words. Since the OCR output says there's no text, it's not providing the words, so it's a category 3.
