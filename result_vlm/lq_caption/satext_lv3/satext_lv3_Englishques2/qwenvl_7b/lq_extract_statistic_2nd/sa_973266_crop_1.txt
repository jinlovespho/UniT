gt_text: HUBERT
vlm_output: The image contains no visible English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUBERT". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains no visible English text or characters." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a statement that there's no text visible. So the extracted text here is "The image contains no visible English text or characters."

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HUBERT". The OCR output mentions "text" and "characters", but does it mention "HUBERT"? Let me check again. The OCR output says there's no visible English text, which implies that it's stating that there's no text present. However, the actual ground truth is that the text exists ("HUBERT"). So the OCR output is saying there's no text, but the reality is there is text. 

Now, according to the categories: 

Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has "HUBERT" as the only unique word. The OCR output doesn't mention "HUBERT" at all. It's saying there's no text, which is the opposite. So there's no match here.

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But since the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words, it's not even partially correct. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention "HUBERT" and instead says there's no text, it's incorrect. So the answer should be category 3.
