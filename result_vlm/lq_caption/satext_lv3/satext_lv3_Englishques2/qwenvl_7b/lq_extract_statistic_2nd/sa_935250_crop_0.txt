gt_text: THE CHARLES HOTEL
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "THE CHARLES HOTEL."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "THE CHARLES HOTEL". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English text in the image reads 'THE CHARLES HOTEL.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "THE CHARLES HOTEL" within quotes. So the extracted text here would be "THE CHARLES HOTEL".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is exactly "THE CHARLES HOTEL". Now, according to the steps given:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both have the same words in the same order.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: THE, CHARLES, HOTEL. The OCR output also has these exact words.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps, same spacing. No punctuation differences here.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here.

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it should be category 1. The answer is 1.
