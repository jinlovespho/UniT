gt_text: Victoria Station
vlm_output: The visible English text in the image reads "Victoria Station."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided the ground truth text "Victoria Station" and the VLM OCR output which says "The visible English text in the image reads 'Victoria Station.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the phrase "Victoria Station" within quotes. So the extracted text here would be "Victoria Station" since that's the actual text captured by the OCR.

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Victoria Station" as well. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, the words are in the same order. 

Now, checking the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Victoria" and "Station". The OCR output also has exactly those two words. 

The guidelines say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has the same capitalization as the ground truth, but even if it were different, like "victoria station" or "VICTORIA STATION", it would still be considered a match. Also, there's no extra or missing spaces here. 

Small typos are still considered matches. Since there are no typos in the OCR output, this is straightforward. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Here, both words match perfectly. So the category should be 1.
