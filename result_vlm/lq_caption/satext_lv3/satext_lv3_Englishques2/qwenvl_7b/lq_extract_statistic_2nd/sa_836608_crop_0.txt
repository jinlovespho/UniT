gt_text: LAMBORGHINI
vlm_output: The image contains the word "LAMBORGHINI" in capital letters.

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LAMBORGHINI". The VLM OCR output says, "The image contains the word 'LAMBORGHINI' in capital letters." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the word "LAMBORGHINI" explicitly. So the extracted text here is "LAMBORGHINI".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "LAMBORGHINI". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "LAMBORGHINI", we check if that word is present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, the extracted text is exactly "LAMBORGHINI", same as the ground truth. Even though the OCR output has additional text ("The image contains the word..."), the extracted text is the same. The rules mention ignoring word order, which isn't an issue here since there's only one word. Also, capitalization is ignored, but both are in all caps. There are no typos here either. So the OCR output correctly includes the ground truth word.

Therefore, category 1 applies because all unique words (just one here) from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
