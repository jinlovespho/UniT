gt_text: ZRINSKI
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "ZPRINSKI".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "ZRINSKI" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is 'ZPRINSKI'." 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is 'ZPRINSKI'." So, the actual extracted text would be "ZPRINSKI" because that's the part in quotes. But wait, the instruction says to extract the text content, so maybe I should consider the entire sentence? Hmm, but the example given in the problem might clarify that. Let me check the example again. The ground truth is "ZRINSKI" and the OCR output is "The visible text in the image is 'ZPRINSKI'." So the extracted text from the OCR output is "ZPRINSKI" because that's what's in the quotes. So the OCR output's text content is "ZPRINSKI".

Now, step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ZRINSKI". The comparison rules are:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "ZRINSKI", the unique words are just that one.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "ZPRINSKI" which is all caps, same as the ground truth's "ZRINSKI" (assuming the ground truth is also all caps, but the problem statement shows it as "ZRINSKI" with capital Z and R, but maybe the OCR output is "ZPRINSKI" which is Z-P-R-I-N-S-K-I. Wait, the ground truth is ZRINSKI (Z-R-I-N-S-K-I) and the OCR output is ZPRINSKI (Z-P-R-I-N-S-K-I). So the difference is the second letter: R vs P.

Now, the rules say that small typos still count as matches. So, even if there's a typo, like P instead of R, it's considered a match. Wait, but the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output has a typo but the word is otherwise the same except for that typo, it's considered a match. But here, the OCR output is "ZPRINSKI" vs the ground truth "ZRINSKI". The difference is the second letter: P vs R. That's a single character typo. According to the rules, even small typos count as matches. So does that mean that "ZPRINSKI" is considered a match for "ZRINSKI"?

But wait, the instruction says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." The ground truth has one unique word: "ZRINSKI". The OCR output's extracted text is "ZPRINSKI". So the question is whether "ZPRINSKI" is considered a match for "ZRINSKI" given the typo.

The rules state that small typos still count as matches. So even if there's a typo, it's considered a match. Therefore, "ZPRINSKI" would be considered a match for "ZRINSKI" because the typo is small (just one letter difference). Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just "ZRINSKI") appear in the OCR output, considering the typo as a match.

So according to category 1: Correct, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
