gt_text: MADISON SQUARE GARDEN CHASE
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MADISON SQUARE GARDEN CHASE". The VLM OCR output says, "The image is too blurry to discern any clear English text or characters."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that the image is blurry and no clear text can be discerned. So the extracted text from the OCR is that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. But the OCR output here isn't providing any text; it's stating that there's no discernible text.

The ground truth has the words: Madison, Square, Garden, Chase. The OCR output doesn't mention any of these words. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read text. So there's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider that maybe "text" is a word in the OCR output, but the ground truth words are specific names (Madison Square Garden Chase), which are not present in the OCR output.

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match at all. The OCR didn't recognize any words, so it's not even partially correct. Even if there was a typo, but there's no mention of any words here. So the answer is 3.
