Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "3" and the VLM OCR output is also "3". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "3", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are just "3", so order isn't an issue.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "3". The OCR output also has "3". So the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since there's only one character here, none of these factors apply. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both have the same word, this fits Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
