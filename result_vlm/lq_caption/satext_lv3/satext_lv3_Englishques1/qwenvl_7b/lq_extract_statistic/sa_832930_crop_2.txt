gt_text: Victoria
vlm_output: Victoria Station

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria," and the VLM OCR output is "Victoria Station." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Victoria Station," which consists of two words: "Victoria" and "Station."

Next, I compare this with the ground truth, which is just "Victoria." The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are only "Victoria." 

Now, checking if "Victoria" is present in the OCR output. Yes, it is. The OCR output has "Victoria" as the first word. Even though there's an extra word "Station," that doesn't affect the presence of "Victoria." 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output is correctly capitalized and has a space between the words, but since we're only looking for the presence of "Victoria," the extra word doesn't matter. 

Since all unique words in the ground truth (just "Victoria") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. The presence of an additional word doesn't make it incorrect because the category is based on the unique words from the ground truth being present, not on the OCR output being exact. 

I should make sure I'm not overcomplicating it. The key points are that the ground truth's unique words are all in the OCR output, even if there are extra words. So the answer is category 1.
