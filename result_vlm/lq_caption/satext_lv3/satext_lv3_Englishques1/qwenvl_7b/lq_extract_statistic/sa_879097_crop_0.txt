Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "251" and a VLM OCR output "251". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "251", which is straightforward. There's no additional text or formatting mentioned, so the extracted text is just "251".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order does NOT matter. However, in this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are single numbers. Since there's only one "word" (or number), order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "251".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Again, since both are just numbers without any letters or punctuation, this doesn't affect the comparison.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are exactly "251".

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, this condition is met. The unique word "251" is present in the OCR output.

2 — Slightly correct: At least one but not all unique words match. This doesn't apply here because all unique words (just one) do match.

3 — Incorrect: No words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. This is not the case here.

Therefore, the category should be 1. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, meeting all criteria for a correct match.
