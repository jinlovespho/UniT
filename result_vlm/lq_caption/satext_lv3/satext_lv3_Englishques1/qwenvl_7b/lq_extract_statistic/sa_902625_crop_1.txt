gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "NIKE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. There's no typo either because they're identical. 

So all unique ground truth words (just "NIKE") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. Everything matches perfectly.
