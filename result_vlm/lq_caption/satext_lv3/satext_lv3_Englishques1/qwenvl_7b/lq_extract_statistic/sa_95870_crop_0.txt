Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Wolt" and the VLM OCR output is also "Wolt". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Wolt", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Wolt".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are exactly the same word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Wolt". The OCR output also has "Wolt". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization (all caps?), but the original text is "Wolt" which is capitalized, and the OCR output is also "Wolt". So no issues here. No extra spaces or missing spaces since it's a single word.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because they are identical.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
