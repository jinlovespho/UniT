gt_text: 80
vlm_output: WORLDS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "80", and the VLM OCR output is "WORLDS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "WORLDS", which is a single word. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "80", which is a number. The unique words in the ground truth would be just "80". Now, the OCR output has "WORLDS", which is a different word entirely. 

Looking at the criteria: the comparison is based on unique words from the ground truth. Since "80" is a number and "WORLDS" is a word, they don't match. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and typos, but "WORLDS" isn't a typo of "80". It's a completely different word. 

So, the unique ground truth word "80" isn't present in the OCR output. Therefore, there are no matches. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output isn't related to the ground truth at all. Even if I consider "WORLDS" as a typo, it's not a small typo of "80". So the answer should be 3.
