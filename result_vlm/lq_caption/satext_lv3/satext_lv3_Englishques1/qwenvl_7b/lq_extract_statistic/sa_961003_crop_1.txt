gt_text: REIMS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "REIMS" and the VLM OCR output is "2014". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is a number. The ground truth is "REIMS", which is a proper noun, likely a place name. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches. 

Wait, the ground truth is "REIMS" which is one word. The OCR output is "2014", which is four digits. Let's break it down. The unique words in the ground truth are just "REIMS". The OCR output has "2014", which is not a word but numbers. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, the OCR output doesn't have "REIMS" at all. It's numbers. So there's no match. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have that word, there's zero matches. 

Category 3 is if no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. In this case, the OCR output is numbers, which are unrelated to the ground truth word "REIMS". So this would fall into category 3. 

But wait, are there any typos that could be considered? For example, if the OCR had "reims" or something similar. But "2014" is completely different. There's no overlap in characters or possible typos. So no, there's no match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
