gt_text: KLM
vlm_output: KLM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KLM" and the VLM OCR output is also "KLM". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are just "KLM", the order is the same, but even if it weren't, it wouldn't matter. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "KLM". The OCR output also has "KLM", so that's a match. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because they're identical.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, the answer should be 1.
