gt_text: FABBRI

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FABBRI" and the VLM OCR output is "1048". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1048", which is numbers. The ground truth is "FABBRI", which is a name, probably Italian. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is numbers, while the ground truth is letters. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "FABBRI" (assuming it's one word). The OCR output is "1048", which are numbers. Since there's no overlap in characters between the two, even considering typos, numbers can't be considered as letters. For example, "1" isn't a typo for "F", they are different characters. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the letters in "FABBRI". Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. 

I think the answer is 3.
