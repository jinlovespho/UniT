gt_text: Mercure
vlm_output: MERCURY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Mercure" and the VLM OCR output is "MERCURY". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MERCURY". Then, I compare it with the ground truth, which is "Mercure". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Mercure". The OCR output has "MERCURY". 

Next, I need to consider ignoring capitalization. Both words are in different cases, but if I convert them to the same case, like lowercase, they become "mercure" and "mercury". Now, checking for typos: "mercure" vs. "mercury". The correct spelling is "Mercure" (which is the French word for Mercury, the planet). However, "Mercury" is the English spelling. But the problem states that small typos still count as matches. Wait, but in this case, the OCR output is "MERCURY" which is the English spelling, while the ground truth is "Mercure" (French). Are they considered the same? 

But the instructions mention that small typos count as matches. However, "Mercure" and "Mercury" are different words in different languages. But the problem might be treating them as the same if the OCR is supposed to capture the same content. However, since the ground truth is "Mercure" and the OCR is "Mercury", they are different words. But maybe the OCR made a mistake in the spelling. However, according to the criteria, small typos still count as matches. Wait, but "Mercure" and "Mercury" are not typos of each other; they are different words. So maybe this is considered a typo? Or is it a different word altogether?

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "Mercure" as the only unique word. The OCR output is "MERCURY". So, if we ignore capitalization, it's "mercury" vs. "mercure". Are these considered the same? The problem states that small typos still count as matches. However, "mercure" and "mercury" are not typos but different words. Unless the OCR is supposed to recognize the same word but in a different language. But the problem doesn't mention language differences. So, if the OCR output is "Mercury" and the ground truth is "Mercure", they are different words. Therefore, the OCR output does not contain the ground truth word. 

But the user might be considering that "Mercure" is the French spelling of Mercury, so maybe the OCR is supposed to recognize it as the same entity. However, the problem's instructions don't mention language differences. The criteria say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces, but not language. So, if the OCR output is "Mercury" and the ground truth is "Mercure", they are different words. Therefore, the OCR output does not contain the ground truth word. 

In that case, the answer would be category 3, because no words match. But wait, the problem says "small typos still count as matches". However, "Mercure" and "Mercury" are not typos but different words. So, even with the typo consideration, they are different. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have the correct word. Hence, category 3: Incorrect. But wait, maybe the problem considers that the OCR output has "Mercury" which is a close variant. But according to the instructions, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "Mercure", and the OCR has "Mercury". Since they are different words, even if they are related, the category would be 3. But maybe the user intended that "Mercure" is a typo for "Mercury", but in reality, they are different. Therefore, the answer is 3.
