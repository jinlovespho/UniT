gt_text: YP700
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "YP700" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "10%", which is just the numbers 1 and 0 and the percent sign. The ground truth is "YP700" which has letters Y, P, and numbers 7, 0, 0.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "YP700" which is one word. So the unique words in ground truth are just "YP700". But the OCR output is "10%", which is a different word. 

But the instructions mention considering typos, but here the OCR output doesn't have any letters at all. The ground truth has letters Y and P, which are not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has numbers and a percentage symbol. So there's no overlap in the characters. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 otherwise. Since the OCR output has no matching words (even considering typos, but the letters Y and P aren't there), it's category 3. The OCR output is "10%", which is unrelated to "YP700". So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 266
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 630
