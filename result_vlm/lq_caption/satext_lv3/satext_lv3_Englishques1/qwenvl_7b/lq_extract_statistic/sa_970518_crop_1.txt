Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NIKE", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NIKE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output is exactly the same. So when comparing, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. Since the OCR output has the exact same word, it's a correct match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, that's category 1. There's no case where the OCR output is missing words here. So the answer should be 1.
