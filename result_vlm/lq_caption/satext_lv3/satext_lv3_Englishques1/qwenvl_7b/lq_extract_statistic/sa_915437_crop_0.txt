gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: Duty

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Duty" and the VLM OCR output is also "Duty". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Duty".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Duty". The OCR output also has "Duty". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (both start with uppercase D), no punctuation, and no extra spaces. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the words are identical.

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
