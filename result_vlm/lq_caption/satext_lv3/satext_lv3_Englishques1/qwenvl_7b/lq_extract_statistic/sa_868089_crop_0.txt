gt_text: Phoenix
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Phoenix". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is the entire sentence about the image not containing text. But the question is about comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "Phoenix", which is a single word. The OCR output is a statement that there's no visible English text.

Now, Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter, and only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Phoenix". The OCR output's extracted text includes words like "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text". None of these words are "Phoenix" or any variation of it. 

Even if we consider typos, the OCR output doesn't have any word that could be a typo for "Phoenix". The output is stating that there's no text, so it's not mentioning "Phoenix" at all. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, Category 3 is when no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since the OCR output is saying there's no text, which is unrelated to the ground truth word "Phoenix", and there's no match, the category should be 3.
