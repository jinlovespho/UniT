gt_text: VERITÀ
vlm_output: 10%

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VERITÀ" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%". Then, I compare this with the ground truth "VERITÀ".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "VERITÀ". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. Now, checking if there's any overlap. The word "VERITÀ" is a noun meaning truth in Italian. The OCR output has "10%", which is a number. There's no overlap in words here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

Even if we consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "VERITÀ" in any way. The letters are completely different. So, according to the criteria, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The output is largely wrong or unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
