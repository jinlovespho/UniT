gt_text: STATES
vlm_output: UNITED STATESPARK POLICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STATES", and the VLM OCR output is "UNITED STATESPARK POLICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "UNITED STATESPARK POLICE". I should split this into individual words. Let me see: "UNITED", "STATESPARK", "POLICE". Wait, "STATESPARK" might be a typo or a combination of "STATES" and "SPARK". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "STATES". The OCR output has "STATESPARK". Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the order. I need to check if "STATES" is present in the OCR output's words, considering possible typos and ignoring case, punctuation, and spaces.

Looking at "STATESPARK", if I remove the "SPARK" part, does it become "STATES"? Well, "STATESPARK" is a single word. But the ground truth is "STATES". The rule says small typos still count as matches. However, "STATESPARK" has extra letters ("SPARK") added to "STATES". Is that considered a small typo? The problem says small typos count as matches, but adding extra letters might be more than a small typo. Alternatively, maybe "STATESPARK" is a misspelling where "STATES" is part of it. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "STATES" as the unique word. 

So, does "STATESPARK" contain "STATES"? If we consider that "STATESPARK" is a typo where "SPARK" is an extra part, but the main part is "STATES", maybe it's considered a match. But the problem says small typos still count as matches. However, adding "SPARK" might be considered a larger error. Alternatively, maybe "STATESPARK" is a merged word, and the OCR might have merged "STATES" and "SPARK" into one word. In that case, the presence of "STATES" as a substring in "STATESPARK" might not be sufficient unless it's a typo. 

But according to the rules, we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth is "STATES", which is a single word. The OCR output has "STATESPARK" as a word. If "STATESPARK" is considered to contain "STATES" as a typo (maybe the OCR misread "SPARK" as part of "STATES"), then it's a match. But if "STATESPARK" is a separate word that doesn't include "STATES", then it's not a match. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output has "STATES" and "SPARK" as separate words, but the OCR output is "UNITED STATESPARK POLICE". Wait, the OCR output is "UNITED STATESPARK POLICE". So the words are "UNITED", "STATESPARK", "POLICE". There's no "STATES" as a separate word. The "STATESPARK" is a single word. So, does that count as containing "STATES"? If we consider that "STATESPARK" is a typo where "SPARK" is an extra, then maybe it's a partial match. But according to the rules, small typos still count as matches. However, "STATESPARK" is not just a small typo of "STATES"; it's adding letters. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output has "STATES" as part of "STATESPARK", but since it's not a separate word, it's not considered. The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "STATES", so the OCR output must have "STATES" as a word. But in the OCR output, the word is "STATESPARK". Therefore, "STATES" is not present as a separate word. Hence, the unique word from the ground truth is not present in the OCR output. 

But then, the category would be 3 if no words match. However, the OCR output has "STATESPARK" which might be a typo. But the rules state that small typos still count as matches. However, "STATESPARK" is not a small typo of "STATES"; it's a longer word. So maybe it's not considered a match. 

Therefore, the OCR output does not contain "STATES" as a word. The only words are "UNITED", "STATESPARK", "POLICE". None of these are "STATES". So the category would be 3, since no words match. But wait, the problem says that small typos still count as matches. If "STATESPARK" is considered a typo of "STATES" (maybe OCR added "SPARK" by mistake), but that's a larger error. However, the problem says small typos count. So maybe "STATESPARK" is not considered a match. Therefore, the answer is category 3. 

But wait, maybe "STATESPARK" is a misspelling where "SPARK" is an extra, but the main part is "STATES". However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "STATES", the OCR output must have "STATES" as a word. Since it doesn't, even with a typo, the answer is 3. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output is "STATESPARK", and "STATES" is a substring, but the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So the OCR output's words are "UNITED", "STATESPARK", "POLICE". None of these are "STATES", so no match. Therefore, category 3.
