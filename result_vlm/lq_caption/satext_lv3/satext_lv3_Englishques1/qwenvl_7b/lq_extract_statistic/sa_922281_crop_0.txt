gt_text: 700
vlm_output: TNT

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "700" and the VLM OCR output is "TNT". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "TNT". Now, comparing that to the ground truth "700". The instructions say to consider word order as not mattering, but the ground truth has only one word, "700", which is a number. The OCR output is "TNT", which is three letters.

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has a single unique word: "700". The OCR output has "TNT" as its only word. Now, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but "TNT" and "700" don't look like typos of each other. They are entirely different characters. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, but "TNT" is already uppercase, and "700" is numeric, so case doesn't apply here. Punctuation and spacing are to be ignored, but neither of these examples have any. 

Since the ground truth is "700" and the OCR output is "TNT", there's no overlap in the words. The unique words in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's not matching any part of the ground truth. So the answer should be category 3.
