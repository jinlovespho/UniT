gt_text: TREZOR
vlm_output: TREZOR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TREZOR" and the VLM OCR output is also "TREZOR". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors.

First, word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TREZOR". The OCR output also has "TREZOR". So the set of unique words matches exactly.

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces—there are none here. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if there were typos, like "TREZOR" vs "TREZOR", but in this case, they are the same. So definitely category 1.
