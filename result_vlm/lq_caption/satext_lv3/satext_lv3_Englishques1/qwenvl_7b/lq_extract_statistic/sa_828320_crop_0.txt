gt_text: HOTEL
vlm_output: 100

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOTEL" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HOTEL", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100", which is three digits. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here the OCR output has no words related to "HOTEL". The unique word in the ground truth is "HOTEL", but the OCR output doesn't have that word. 

Also, they mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but "100" is just numbers. There's no typo here because "100" isn't a variation of "HOTEL". So, there's no match. 

Since the OCR output has no words matching the ground truth, according to the categories, that's category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is unrelated.
