gt_text: MOD
vlm_output: MOD PIZZA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MOD" and the VLM OCR output is "MOD PIZZA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MOD PIZZA". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, which is "MOD". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So, I can ignore the order of words. The ground truth has one unique word: "MOD". The OCR output has two words: "MOD" and "PIZZA". 

Next, I need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since "MOD" is present in the OCR output, that's a match. The other word in the OCR output, "PIZZA", isn't part of the ground truth, but the rules say we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, even though there's an extra word, as long as all the ground truth words are there, it's correct.

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are in uppercase, so that's fine. There's no punctuation to worry about. The OCR output has an extra space between "MOD" and "PIZZA", but the rules say to ignore extra spaces. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The word "MOD" is exactly as in the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words from the ground truth ("MOD") are present in the OCR output, even with an extra word, the category should be 1 — Correct.
