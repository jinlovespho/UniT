gt_text: Steelers
vlm_output: Steelers

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Steelers" and the VLM OCR output is also "Steelers". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Steelers".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Steelers". The OCR output is the same word. So, checking the conditions: since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (just "Steelers"), even though there's no difference, it's a correct match. The categories say category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's exactly the same, it's category 1. There's no typo here, but even if there were a small typo, it would still count as a match. But in this case, it's perfect. So the answer should be 1.
