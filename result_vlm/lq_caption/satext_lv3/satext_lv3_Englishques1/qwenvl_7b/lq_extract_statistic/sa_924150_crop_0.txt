gt_text: New
vlm_output: FIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "New" and the VLM OCR output is "FIT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "FIT".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "New". The OCR output has "FIT". 

Now, checking if there's a match. The ground truth word is "New" and the OCR output is "FIT". Are these considered a match? The guidelines mention that small typos still count as matches, but "FIT" isn't a typo of "New". They are completely different words. Also, ignoring capitalization, but "New" and "FIT" are both capitalized, but that doesn't make them the same. 

Since there are no overlapping words between "New" and "FIT", the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3—Incorrect. 

So the answer should be 3.
