gt_text: EY
vlm_output: EY

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EY" and the VLM OCR output is also "EY". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "EY", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Both texts here are just two letters, so order isn't an issue here. 

Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "EY". Wait, but "EY" is a single word here. The OCR output is also "EY", so the unique words in both are the same. 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and no spaces. So that's all the same.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly "EY".

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The output matches exactly, so it's a correct match. No partial matches or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
