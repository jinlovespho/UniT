gt_text: SQUARE
vlm_output: Coca-Cola

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SQUARE" and the VLM OCR output is "Coca-Cola". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is clearly "Coca-Cola". Now, comparing that to the ground truth "SQUARE".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SQUARE". The OCR output has "Coca-Cola", which is a different word. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at unique words from the ground truth. Since "Coca-Cola" isn't "SQUARE" and there are no other words in the ground truth, there's no match. Also, typos are considered, but here it's not a typo; it's a completely different word. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain the ground truth word. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect, because no words match.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 175
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 407
