gt_text: CASINO
vlm_output: CASINO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CASINO" and the VLM OCR output is also "CASINO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "CASINO".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "CASINO". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, but both are all caps. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here since they're identical. So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. So the answer should be 1.
