gt_text: TELEPHONE
vlm_output: TELEPHONE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TELEPHONE" and the VLM OCR output is also "TELEPHONE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. The next point is to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TELEPHONE". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Both are all caps, but even if they were different cases, like "telephone" vs "TELEPHONE", they would still match. There's no punctuation or extra spaces here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case.

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should fall under category 1. The answer should be 1.
