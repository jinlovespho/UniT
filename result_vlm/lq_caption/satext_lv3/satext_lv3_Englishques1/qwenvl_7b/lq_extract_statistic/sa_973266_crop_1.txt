gt_text: HUBERT
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUBERT". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a statement that there's no visible English text. So the actual text extracted here is "The image does not contain any visible English text."

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HUBERT". The OCR output doesn't mention "HUBERT" at all. It's saying there's no text present. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HUBERT". The OCR output has words like "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text." None of these are "HUBERT". 

Even if we ignore case, capitalization, etc., "HUBERT" isn't in the OCR output. The OCR is stating that there's no text, which is different from the actual content. So, since the OCR output doesn't include the ground truth word at all, it's not matching. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Here, the OCR output doesn't have "HUBERT" and is actually stating there's no text. So it's category 3 because there's no match and the output is unrelated (it's a statement about absence of text rather than the content itself).
