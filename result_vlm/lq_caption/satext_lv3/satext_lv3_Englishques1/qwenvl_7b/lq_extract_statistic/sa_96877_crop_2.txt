gt_text: Toilets
vlm_output: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Toilets" and the VLM OCR output is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "Toilets", which is just one word. 

Now, I need to check if "Toilets" (or any variation considering case, typos, etc.) is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has words like The, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, lazy, dog. None of these words are related to "Toilets". 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output doesn't have the word "Toilets" at all. Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word ("Toilets") and it's not present in the OCR output, the category should be 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth.
