gt_text: EVERY
vlm_output: chicken salad

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EVERY" and the VLM OCR output is "chicken salad". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "chicken salad", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "EVERY". The OCR output has "chicken" and "salad". Now, looking at the criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EVERY".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. So "EVERY" is the same as "every" or "Every".
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo in the OCR output; it's just different words.

Now, checking if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth. The OCR output has "chicken" and "salad", neither of which are related to "EVERY". There's no overlap in the unique words. Since the ground truth only has "EVERY" and the OCR output doesn't have that word, even considering case and typos, there's no match.

Therefore, according to the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Here, none are present.
- Category 2 is for at least one match, but there are none.
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated output.

So the answer should be category 3.
