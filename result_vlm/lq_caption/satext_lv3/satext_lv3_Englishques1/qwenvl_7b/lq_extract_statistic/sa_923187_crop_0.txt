gt_text: Cannabis
vlm_output: Cannabis

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Cannabis" and the VLM OCR output is also "Cannabis". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The extracted text is "Cannabis".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Cannabis". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, check for capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are exactly the same, so no issues there. The problem mentions small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So, all unique ground truth words (just "Cannabis") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect elements here. The answer should be 1.
