----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TCM", and the VLM OCR output is "W 4652 TCM03-23". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has "W", "4652", "TCM03-23". But the ground truth is just "TCM". 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "TCM". 

Next, I need to check if "TCM" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "TCM03-23". The question mentions that small typos still count as matches. Here, "TCM03-23" has "TCM" as a prefix. But does that count as a match? The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is only "TCM", I need to see if "TCM" is present in the OCR output. 

But "TCM03-23" is a longer string. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces and consider small typos. However, adding numbers and hyphens might not be considered a typo. Wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches". So maybe if the OCR output has "TCM" as part of a longer string, but the exact word isn't there. For example, if the OCR output was "TCM" with some typos like "TcM", that would still count. But here, the OCR output is "TCM03-23". Is "TCM" considered a match even though it's part of a longer string?

Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "TCM". The OCR output has "TCM03-23". So the question is whether "TCM03-23" is considered to contain the word "TCM" when ignoring punctuation and extra characters. The instructions also mention to ignore punctuation and extra/missing spaces. So maybe we should process the OCR output by removing punctuation and splitting into words. But the OCR output is "W 4652 TCM03-23". If we split by spaces, the words are "W", "4652", "TCM03-23". Then, we need to check if any of these contain "TCM" when ignoring punctuation. 

If we remove the hyphen and numbers, "TCM03-23" becomes "TCM". But the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so maybe we can consider that. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "TCM03-23" as a word, and the ground truth is "TCM", does that count? The instructions say that small typos still count as matches. But adding numbers and a hyphen might be more than a typo. However, the instruction doesn't specify whether adding numbers is considered a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe we should split the OCR output into tokens and check if any token contains the ground truth word as a substring. But the instructions don't mention substring matching, only exact word matches with some flexibility. 

Wait, the problem says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has "TCM" as a unique word. The OCR output has "TCM03-23" as a word. If we consider that "TCM03-23" contains "TCM" as a prefix, but the instruction says to ignore punctuation and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output's word is "TCM03-23", which includes numbers and a hyphen. The instruction says to ignore punctuation, so maybe we can remove the hyphen and numbers. If we do that, then "TCM03-23" becomes "TCM". 

But how to process that. The problem says to ignore punctuation, so perhaps we can process each word in the OCR output by removing non-alphanumeric characters. So "TCM03-23" becomes "TCM0323". Then, does "TCM" appear as a substring in "TCM0323"? If yes, then maybe it counts as a match. However, the instructions don't specify substring matching. The original ground truth is a single word, and the OCR output's word is a longer string. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have "TCM" as part of the text, even if it's part of a longer string. But the instructions don't explicitly say that. The problem is a bit ambiguous here. However, given that the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and the OCR output's words are "W", "4652", "TCM03-23", none of which exactly match "TCM". However, if we consider that "TCM03-23" could be a typo where "TCM" is the intended word, perhaps with some extra characters. 

But the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So if the OCR output had "TcM" instead of "TCM", that would count. But adding numbers and a hyphen may not be considered a small typo. However, the problem might be expecting that the presence of "TCM" as a substring in the OCR output counts as a match, even if it's part of a longer string. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have the word "TCM" if it's present in the text, even if it's part of a longer string. For example, if the OCR output was "TCM123", then "TCM" is part of that. But the instructions don't specify this. 

Given the ambiguity, but considering the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and the OCR output's words don't exactly match "TCM", but "TCM" is a prefix of "TCM03-23", perhaps the answer is that it's a correct match. However, I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have the word "TCM" if it's part of the text, even with extra characters. But the problem's instructions don't explicitly say that. If we strictly compare exact words, then "TCM" is not present in the OCR output. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so maybe we can remove the hyphen and numbers from "TCM03-23" to get "TCM", which would match the ground truth. 

In that case, the category would be 1 — Correct, because all unique ground truth words (only "TCM") are present in the OCR output when ignoring punctuation and extra characters. 

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the OCR output is "W 4652 TCM03-23". If we split into words and remove punctuation, we have "W", "4652", "TCM0323". Then, does "TCM" appear as a substring in "TCM0323"? Yes. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the ground truth is "TCM", and the OCR output has a word that contains "TCM" as a substring, does that count as a match? The instructions don't specify substring matching, only exact word matches with some flexibility. 

If the OCR output had "TCM" as a separate word, then it's a match. But since it's part of a longer string, maybe not. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So perhaps the OCR output is considered to have "TCM" as part of the text, even if it's in a longer string. 

This is a bit unclear, but given that the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, and "TCM03-23" could be seen as a typo where "TCM" is the intended word with some extra characters, maybe it's considered a correct match. Therefore, the answer would be category 1.
