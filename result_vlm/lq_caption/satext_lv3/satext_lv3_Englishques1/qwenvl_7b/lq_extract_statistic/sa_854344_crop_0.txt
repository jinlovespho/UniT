gt_text: MARIO
vlm_output: The image shows a sign with the text "THE BAY" and below it, there is another line of text that appears to be "BAY BREEZE". The text is partially obscured by the angle and resolution of the image.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "MARIO". The VLM OCR output says the image has "THE BAY" and "BAY BREEZE", but the text is partially obscured. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR mentions "THE BAY" and "BAY BREEZE". So the extracted text would be those two phrases. 

Next, compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MARIO", which is a single word. The OCR output has words like "THE", "BAY", "BREEZE". None of these words are "MARIO" or similar. Even if I consider typos or variations, there's no match. 

The categories are based on unique words from the ground truth. Since "MARIO" isn't present in the OCR text, there's no match. So according to category 3, which is for no matches or unrelated outputs, the answer should be 3.
