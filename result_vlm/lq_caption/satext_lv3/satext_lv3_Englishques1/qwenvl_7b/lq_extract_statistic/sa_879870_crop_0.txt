gt_text: TOPAZ
vlm_output: SANT JOAN DE VILANOVA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TOPAZ", and the VLM OCR output is "SANT JOAN DE VILANOVA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SANT JOAN DE VILANOVA". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "TOPAZ". The OCR output has multiple words: "SANT", "JOAN", "DE", "VILANOVA". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "TOPAZ", I need to check if "TOPAZ" appears in the OCR output. 

Looking at the OCR output words: "SANT", "JOAN", "DE", "VILANOVA". None of these are "TOPAZ". Even considering typos, but "TOPAZ" isn't close to any of these words. The OCR output has entirely different words. 

Also, the categories: category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one, and it's not present, that's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
