gt_text: DB
vlm_output: DB

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DB" and the VLM OCR output is also "DB". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth.

The comparison has some specific rules. First, word order doesn't matter. Since both are just "DB", order isn't an issue here. Then, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DB". The OCR output also has "DB". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or anything missing. So the answer should be 1.
