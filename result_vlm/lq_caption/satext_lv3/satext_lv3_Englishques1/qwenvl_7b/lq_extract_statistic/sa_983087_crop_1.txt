gt_text: BONIA
vlm_output: BONIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BONIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "BONIA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BONIA".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "BONIA". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but there are no typos here.

So all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would be category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
