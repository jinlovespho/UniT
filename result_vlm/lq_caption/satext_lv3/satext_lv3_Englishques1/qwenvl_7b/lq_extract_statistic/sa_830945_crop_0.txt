Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "HYBRID4".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "HYBRID4". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "HYBRID4" since it's a single word. The OCR output is the same, so the set of unique words in the OCR output is also {"HYBRID4"}.

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just one) are present. So that's category 1.

Wait, but what if there were multiple words? For example, if the ground truth was "HYBRID 4" and the OCR was "HYBRID4", but the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So in that case, it would still count as correct. However, in this case, the ground truth is a single word "HYBRID4" and the OCR output is the same. So no issues here. Also, the problem mentions small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. So the comparison is exact.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
