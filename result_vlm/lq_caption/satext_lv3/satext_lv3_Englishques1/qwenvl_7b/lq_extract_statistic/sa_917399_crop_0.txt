gt_text: SMOKING
vlm_output: SMOKING

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "SMOKING" and a VLM OCR output that's also "SMOKING". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "SMOKING", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, but here both texts are single words. So order isn't an issue here.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "SMOKING", which is one unique word. The OCR output is the same word. So the set of unique words in the OCR output should match the ground truth's set. 

The instructions also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. So no issues there. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, that's a full match. There's no missing words or partial matches. So this should fall under category 1. 

I need to make sure there's no trick here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Even if there were a typo, like "SMOKIN" or "SMOKEING", the category would still be 1 because small typos are considered matches. But in this case, it's perfect. So definitely category 1.
