Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "verbal" and the VLM OCR output is also "verbal". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "verbal", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "verbal".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "verbal". The OCR output also has "verbal". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a match. So category 1 applies here. There's no partial match or no match. So the answer should be 1.
