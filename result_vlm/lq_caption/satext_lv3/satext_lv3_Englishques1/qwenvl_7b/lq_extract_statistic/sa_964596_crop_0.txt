gt_text: PADDLE
vlm_output: Paddle or Die

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PADDLE" and the VLM OCR output is "Paddle or Die". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Paddle or Die". So the extracted text is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PADDLE". The OCR output has three words: "Paddle", "or", and "Die". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: we look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just "PADDLE". The OCR output has "Paddle", which is a variation in capitalization and possibly a typo if we consider the original "PADDLE" has all caps. But the rules say to ignore capitalization, so "Paddle" and "PADDLE" are considered the same. 

So "Paddle" in the OCR output matches "PADDLE" from the ground truth. The other words "or" and "Die" don't appear in the ground truth. But since the ground truth only has "PADDLE", and the OCR output includes that word (even with a different capitalization), then all unique ground truth words are present. 

The category is 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "PADDLE" is matched by "Paddle", even though there are extra words, the requirement is met. The other words don't affect the category because the ground truth only has one word. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
