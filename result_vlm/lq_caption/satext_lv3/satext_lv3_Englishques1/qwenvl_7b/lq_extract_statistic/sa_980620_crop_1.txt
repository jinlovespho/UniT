gt_text: 4

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "4" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "4".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "4". The OCR output has "10%", which is a different number. 

But wait, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. However, "10%" isn't a typo of "4"; they are entirely different numbers. Also, we need to consider if "10%" could be considered a match for "4" in any way. But since the ground truth is just "4", and the OCR output is "10%", there's no overlap in the unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "4" isn't present in "10%", and there's no partial match, this would fall into category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text here.
