Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "39" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "39".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "39". The OCR output has "100%", which includes the number 100 and a percentage sign. 

But wait, the problem mentions considering unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth is a single number, "39". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different number. Since "100%" doesn't contain "39" or any part of it, even considering typos or ignoring punctuation, there's no match. The percentage sign is punctuation, which we should ignore. However, "100" is still not "39". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Since there's no overlap between "39" and "100%", the category should be 3. Even if we consider that "100" might have a typo, but "39" isn't present. So the answer is 3.
