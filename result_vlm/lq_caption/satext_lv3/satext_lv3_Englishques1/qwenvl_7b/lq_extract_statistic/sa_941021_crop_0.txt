gt_text: DiGi
vlm_output: The image appears to be very blurry, making it difficult to read any text. If there is any text present, it is not legible due to the image quality.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text "DiGi" and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is: "The image appears to be very blurry, making it difficult to read any text. If there is any text present, it is not legible due to the image quality." So, the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "DiGi". The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only consider the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth. The ground truth text is "DiGi". The unique words here are "DiGi". However, since the OCR output is a sentence about the image being blurry and text not being legible, I need to check if any of the words in the OCR output match "DiGi" when considering the rules.

Wait, the ground truth is "DiGi", which is a single word. But the OCR output doesn't mention "DiGi" at all. The OCR output is talking about the image quality and inability to read text. The words present in the OCR output are: The, image, appears, to, be, very, blurry, making, it, difficult, to, read, any, text, If, there, is, any, text, present, it, is, not, legible, due, to, the, image, quality. 

So, the unique words from the OCR output are: The, image, appears, to, be, very, blurry, making, difficult, read, any, text, If, there, is, present, not, legible, due, quality. 

Now, the ground truth word is "DiGi". The OCR output doesn't have "DiGi" or any variation of it. Even if we consider case insensitivity, the OCR output doesn't have "dig" or "digi" or similar. The closest might be "text" but that's unrelated. 

Since there are no matches for the ground truth word "DiGi" in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, and it's not related to the content of the ground truth. The OCR output is about the image being blurry, which is a different context than the ground truth text "DiGi". 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
