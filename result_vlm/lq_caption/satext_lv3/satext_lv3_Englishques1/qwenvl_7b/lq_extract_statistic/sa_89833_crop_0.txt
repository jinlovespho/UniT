gt_text: BREST
vlm_output: The image provided does not contain any visible English text. It appears to be a close-up of a stone or monument with some inscriptions, but the resolution is too low to read the text clearly. If you have a higher-resolution version of the image, I would be happy to assist further.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "BREST". The VLM OCR output is a description saying there's no visible English text, just a stone or monument with inscriptions but too low resolution. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "inscriptions" but doesn't mention any specific words. The ground truth is "BREST", which is a proper noun, likely a place name.

Now, comparing the extracted text (which is the OCR output) to the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't mention "BREST" at all. It talks about inscriptions but can't read them due to low resolution. So there's no mention of the actual word "BREST" in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since "BREST" isn't present in the OCR output, and the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words (since it's just a description of the image without the actual text), the answer should be category 3.
