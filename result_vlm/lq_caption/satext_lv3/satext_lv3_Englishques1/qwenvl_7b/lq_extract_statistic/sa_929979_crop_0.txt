gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: SCANIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SCANIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "SCANIA". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "SCANIA", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one word: "SCANIA". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor differences like capitalization, but in this case, they are exactly the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SCANIA", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be category 1.
