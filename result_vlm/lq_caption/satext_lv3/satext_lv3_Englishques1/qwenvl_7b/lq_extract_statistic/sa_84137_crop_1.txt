Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1947" and the VLM OCR output is also "1947". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "1947", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, both texts are exactly the same: "1947".

The ground truth has the words "1947". The OCR output has the same. Since the words are the same, and all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though there's only one word, it's a match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since all (the only one) matches, it's category 1. I don't see any typos or differences here. So the answer should be 1.
