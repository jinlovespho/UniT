Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "52093" and the VLM OCR output is also "52093". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "52093", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "52093" is a single number with no spaces or punctuation. The OCR output is exactly the same. So, the set of unique words here is just {"52093"} for both. Since they are identical, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all match, 2 if partially, and 3 if none. Since both are exactly the same, it's a perfect match. Even if there were minor typos, the note says small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos. So the answer should be category 1.
