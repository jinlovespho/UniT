gt_text: 936
vlm_output: PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "936" and the VLM OCR output is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "936". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is "936", which is a number. So the unique words here would just be "936". However, the OCR output is a phrase with multiple words: "PONTE", "DE", "SANTO", "DOMINGOS". 

Now, the key points from the guidelines: word order doesn't matter, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and typos. But the ground truth is a number, not a word. The OCR output has no numbers at all. So the unique words in the ground truth are "936", but the OCR output has none of that. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. 
2 if at least one but not all. 
3 if none or unrelated.

Since the ground truth is a number and the OCR output is a phrase with no numbers, there's no match. Therefore, category 3 applies here. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, which is just a number. Even if we consider typos or other factors, there's no overlap in the words. So the answer should be 3.
