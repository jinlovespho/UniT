Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HEYKERS" and the OCR output is "2018". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2018", which is just numbers. Then Step 2 says to compare with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, unique words from ground truth, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth has one word: "HEYKERS". The OCR output is "2018". Let's break it down. The ground truth word is "HEYKERS". The OCR output is numbers, which are not letters. So, there's no overlap in characters. Even if we consider typos, "2018" doesn't resemble "HEYKERS" in any way. The letters H, E, Y, K, E, R, S are all letters, while the OCR output is numbers. So there's no matching words here. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth. Even if we ignore case and spacing, the OCR output is entirely different in terms of characters. So, the answer should be 3.
