Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "40" and a VLM OCR output "40". They want me to determine the category based on the comparison rules given.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "40", which is straightforward. The ground truth is also "40". 

Now, moving to Step 2: comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are the same. 

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "40". The OCR output also has "40". So the unique words match exactly. 

The rules also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are just "40", there's nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos are considered matches. But there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, this should be a Category 1. 

Wait, but what if the OCR had something like "40" vs "40"? Well, they are exactly the same. So no issues. No other words are involved. So the answer should be 1.
