gt_text: SABAH
vlm_output: Hotel

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "SABAH" and the VLM OCR output is "Hotel". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Hotel", so that's straightforward. Then Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth, considering the specified factors.

The ground truth has the word "SABAH". The OCR output is "Hotel". Now, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we just look at the set of unique words. The ground truth has one unique word: "SABAH". The OCR output has one unique word: "Hotel".

Next, we need to compare these, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are single words, no punctuation or spaces. But "SABAH" vs. "Hotel" – are they considered matches? The note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are completely different. "SABAH" is a name, maybe a place, and "Hotel" is a type of establishment. There's no overlap in the words. So the unique words in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Here, none match. So it would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated. Even though they are both single words, they are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
