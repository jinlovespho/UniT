gt_text: MAXI
vlm_output: MAXI ZOO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MAXI" and the VLM OCR output is "MAXI ZOO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MAXI ZOO", so the words are "MAXI" and "ZOO".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MAXI". The OCR output has two words: "MAXI" and "ZOO". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so we don't need to check the order. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are {"MAXI"}.

Now, check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output includes "MAXI", which is the same as the ground truth word. Even though there's an extra word "ZOO", the presence of "MAXI" is sufficient. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Capitalization and spacing are ignored, but in this case, the case matches exactly.

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even with an extra word, the category should be 1 — Correct. The presence of "ZOO" doesn't affect the category because the requirement is that all ground truth words are present, not that the OCR output has exactly the same words. The extra words are allowed as long as the required ones are there.
