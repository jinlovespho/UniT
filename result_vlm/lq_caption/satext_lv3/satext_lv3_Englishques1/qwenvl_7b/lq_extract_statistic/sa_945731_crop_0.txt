gt_text: Richards
vlm_output: W 4th St

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "Richards" and the VLM OCR output is "W 4th St". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "W 4th St". So the words are "W", "4th", and "St".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "Richards". The ground truth has only one word: "Richards".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the order. But I need to compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Richards".

Now, I have to check if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth word, considering case, spacing, typos, etc. The OCR output has "W", "4th", and "St". None of these are "Richards" or any variation of it. 

Wait, but the problem says that small typos still count as matches. However, "W" is just a single letter, "4th" is a number and abbreviation, and "St" is a common abbreviation for street. None of these are close to "Richards" even with typos. There's no overlap in the words. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word and the OCR output doesn't contain it, the category would be 3 — Incorrect. Because there are no matching words. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth.
