gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is straightforward since it's just "BUT". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But here, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT". The OCR output also has "BUT". 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "BUT" (same case, no spaces), that's already matching. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "BUT") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words or extra words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as partially correct or incorrect. The only possible issue could be if there were additional words, but since both are the same single word, it's a perfect match.
