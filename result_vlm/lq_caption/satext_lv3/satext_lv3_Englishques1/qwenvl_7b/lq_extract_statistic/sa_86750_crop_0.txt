gt_text: D&G
vlm_output: D&G

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "D&G" and the VLM OCR output is also "D&G". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "D&G", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "D&G" as a single entity. The OCR output has the same. Since they match exactly, even considering the special character &, and ignoring case (though both are uppercase here), there's no issue. 

No typos are present, so the small typos rule doesn't come into play. Also, there's no extra or missing spaces because both are just "D&G". 

Since all unique words (which is just "D&G") from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, this should fall under Category 1. There's no partial match here because the output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
