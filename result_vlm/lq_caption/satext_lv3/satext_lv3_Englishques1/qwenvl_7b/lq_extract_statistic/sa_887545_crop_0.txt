Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "MULTIPLEX" and the OCR output is "100". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. But the ground truth is a single word, "MULTIPLEX", and the OCR output is "100". Now, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "MULTIPLEX", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

But the OCR output is "100", which is a number. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces, but "100" is a number, not a word. Also, the ground truth is "MULTIPLEX", which is a word. There's no overlap here. Even if I consider typos, "100" doesn't resemble "MULTIPLEX" in any way. So, there are no matching words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there are no matches, the answer should be 3.
