Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "32" and the VLM OCR output is also "32". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, that's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The set of unique words in the ground truth is just {"32"}, and the OCR output has the same. So all unique words match. Also, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces—there are none here. Typos are considered as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
