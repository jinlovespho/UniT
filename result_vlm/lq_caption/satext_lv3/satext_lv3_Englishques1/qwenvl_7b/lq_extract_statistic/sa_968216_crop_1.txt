Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "100%", and the VLM OCR output is also "100%". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "100%", so the extracted text is the same.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "100%". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if there were typos, like "100%" vs "100%", but since they are the same, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
