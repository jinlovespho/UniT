gt_text: Epsom
vlm_output: Epsom

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Epsom" and the VLM OCR output is also "Epsom". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Epsom", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos are still considered matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "Epsom" is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Since both are exactly the same, even if there were minor differences like capitalization (but here both are capitalized), they would still match. There are no typos here, so that's a perfect match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("Epsom") and the OCR output has the same, this would be category 1. There's no case where part of the words match or none. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
