Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "13" and the VLM OCR output is also "13". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "13", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are just "13", which is a single number. Since there's only one word, order isn't an issue here.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "13". The OCR output also has "13", so that's a match. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since both are exactly "13", there's nothing to ignore here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be category 1.
