gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CODE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "CODE". Let's break down the OCR output. The OCR says "100%", which is a percentage. The words here are "100" and "%" (but the percentage sign might be considered punctuation). However, the ground truth is "CODE", which is a four-letter word. 

Now, the comparison needs to check if any unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has only one unique word: "CODE". The OCR output has "100%" which doesn't contain "CODE" in any form. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spaces, "100%" doesn't have any letters that match "CODE". There's no overlap in characters or words. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here there's only one, and it's not present),
2 if at least one but not all (but none are present here),
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, even considering the given leniencies, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 47
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 78
