gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "NIKE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they're the same. Also, we should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
