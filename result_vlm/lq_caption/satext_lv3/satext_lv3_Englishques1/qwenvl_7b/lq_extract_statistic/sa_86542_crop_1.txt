Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "88" and the VLM OCR output is also "88". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "88", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are just "88", there's only one word here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "88". The OCR output has the same word. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Even if there were typos, they say small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
