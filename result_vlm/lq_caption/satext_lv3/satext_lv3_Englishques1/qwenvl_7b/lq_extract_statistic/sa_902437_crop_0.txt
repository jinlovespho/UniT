gt_text: ALFA
vlm_output: ALFA ROMEO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ALFA" and the VLM OCR output is "ALFA ROMEO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "ALFA ROMEO", which consists of two words: "ALFA" and "ROMEO".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ALFA". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so we don't need to check the sequence. Also, we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But since both are in uppercase and there's no punctuation, that's straightforward.

Now, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has {"ALFA"}. The OCR output has {"ALFA", "ROMEO"}. 

The rules state that for category 1, all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Since "ALFA" is present in the OCR output, that's a match. However, the OCR output includes an extra word "ROMEO" which isn't in the ground truth. But the instructions mention that we should only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even though there's an extra word, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

Also, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has a space between "ALFA" and "ROMEO", but the ground truth doesn't have any spaces. However, since we're considering the words as a set, the space doesn't affect the comparison. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. "ALFA" is exactly as in the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (even though there's an extra word), the answer should be category 1.
