Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "911" and the VLM OCR output is also "911". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "911".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are the same number. Since there's only one word here, "911", the order isn't an issue. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "911". The OCR output also has "911". So the unique words match.

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are "911", there's no issue here. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
