gt_text: FURLA
vlm_output: 1024

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FURLA" and the VLM OCR output is "1024". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "1024", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FURLA", which is a proper noun, probably a brand name. 

Now, step 2 says to compare considering word order doesn't matter. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "FURLA". The OCR output has "1024" which is numbers. So, do numbers count as words here? The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but numbers aren't mentioned. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "FURLA" as the only word. The OCR output has "1024", which is not a word but a number. 

Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth (assuming numbers aren't considered words here), then there's no match. So according to the categories, category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

But wait, maybe there's a typo? The OCR might have misread letters as numbers. For example, "F" could be "1" or "0" depending on the font. But "FURLA" is five letters. The OCR output is four digits. So even if there were some letters, the length is different. 

So, since there's no overlap in words (assuming numbers aren't considered words), the answer would be category 3.
