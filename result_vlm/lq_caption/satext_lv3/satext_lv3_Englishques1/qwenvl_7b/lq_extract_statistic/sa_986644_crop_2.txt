gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: FRUIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "FRUIT", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both are the same word.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "FRUIT" which is all caps, same as the ground truth. So no issue here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "FRUIT" which is the only unique word in the ground truth, this matches perfectly. 

2 — Slightly correct if at least one but not all words match. But here, all words (just one) do match.

3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is wrong. Not applicable here.

So the answer should be category 1.
