gt_text: D-ATUG
vlm_output: TNT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "D-ATUG" and the VLM OCR output is "TNT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "TNT", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth: "D-ATUG". If we split this into words, it's a single word "D-ATUG". But maybe the hyphen is part of the word. However, the problem says to compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word, "D-ATUG", so the unique words here are just that one word.

Now, the OCR output is "TNT", which is three letters. The question is whether "TNT" matches "D-ATUG" considering the rules. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "D-ATUG" has a hyphen and uppercase letters. The OCR output is all uppercase, but the ground truth has a mix of uppercase and lowercase? Wait, the ground truth is "D-ATUG"—the D is uppercase, then the rest are uppercase as well. Wait, no, the ground truth is written as "D-ATUG"—so D is uppercase, then hyphen, then ATUG. But the OCR output is "TNT", which is all uppercase. However, the rules say to ignore capitalization. So maybe we should convert both to lowercase or uppercase for comparison. Let me check the rules again: "Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces." So, we can ignore case. So, "D-ATUG" would become "d-atug" if we ignore case, but the OCR output is "TNT".

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "D-ATUG" (assuming it's one word). The OCR output is "TNT", which is three letters. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, does "TNT" contain any of the unique words from the ground truth? The ground truth has "D-ATUG", which is a different set of letters. "TNT" doesn't have any of the letters D, A, U, G. So, there's no overlap. But wait, maybe the hyphen is considered a punctuation mark and is ignored. So, if we remove the hyphen from the ground truth, it's "DATUG". Then, comparing "TNT" to "DATUG"—they have no letters in common. Therefore, there's no match. 

But the rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output is completely different. There's no overlapping letters. So, according to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there's no match here. So, it would be category 3: incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the unique words. If the ground truth is "D-ATUG", maybe it's considered as multiple words? Like "D", "ATUG"? But the hyphen might be part of the word. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is considered as a single word, then the OCR output has no matching words. If it's split into "D" and "ATUG", then the OCR output has "TNT" which doesn't contain "D" or "ATUG". Either way, no match. So the answer would be 3.
