gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are exactly the same word.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Nikon". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same way. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. Also, there are no typos because they're identical. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
