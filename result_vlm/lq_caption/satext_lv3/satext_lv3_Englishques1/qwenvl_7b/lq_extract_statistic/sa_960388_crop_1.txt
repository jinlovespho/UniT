gt_text: EVA
vlm_output: HOTEL

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVA" and the VLM OCR output is "HOTEL". I need to follow the steps provided.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "HOTEL". Then compare it with the ground truth, which is "EVA". The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are just "EVA" since it's one word. The OCR output is "HOTEL", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "EVA" and "HOTEL" are both uppercase, but even if they were lowercase, they are different words. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are completely different. There's no overlap in the words. The ground truth has "EVA" and the OCR has "HOTEL". So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word, "EVA", and it's not in the OCR output, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches here. So category 3 is incorrect: no words match, or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
