gt_text: DELTA
vlm_output: Delta

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DELTA" and the VLM OCR output is "Delta". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Delta", which is straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore the sequence. Also, we should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "DELTA". The OCR output has "Delta", which is the same word but with a lowercase 'd'. 

The comparison should ignore capitalization, so "Delta" and "DELTA" are considered the same. There's no punctuation or extra spaces here. The OCR output has exactly one word, which matches the ground truth's unique word. 

Small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—just a difference in capitalization. Since the OCR output contains the same word as the ground truth, even with different casing, it's a correct match. 

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "DELTA") are present in the OCR output. So the category should be 1 — Correct.
