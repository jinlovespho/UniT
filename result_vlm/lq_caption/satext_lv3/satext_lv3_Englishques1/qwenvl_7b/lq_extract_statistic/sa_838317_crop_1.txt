Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FLUVIAL" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "FLUVIAL", which is a 7-letter word related to rivers or fluvial processes.

Step 2 is comparing them. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "FLUVIAL". The OCR output is "1970", which is numbers. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But here, the OCR output has no words—just numbers. So there's no match. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one unique word matches. But "1970" doesn't have any words from the ground truth. The OCR output is numbers, not the word "FLUVIAL" or any variation. Even if there were typos, like "fluvial" being misspelled, but here it's not even close. 

So category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is numbers and the ground truth is a word, there's no overlap. Therefore, it's category 3.
