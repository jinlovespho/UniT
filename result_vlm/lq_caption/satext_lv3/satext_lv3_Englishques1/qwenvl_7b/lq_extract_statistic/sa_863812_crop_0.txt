Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "1", which is a single unique word. The OCR output also has "1". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "1") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would be category 1 — Correct. There's no possibility of partial matches here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
