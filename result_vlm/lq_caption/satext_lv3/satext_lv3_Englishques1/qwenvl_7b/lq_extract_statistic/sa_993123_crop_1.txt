Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "HSBC".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC". The OCR output also has "HSBC". So the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's a perfect match.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
