gt_text: Schweppes
vlm_output: Schweppes

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Schweppes" and the VLM OCR output is also "Schweppes". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Schweppes", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the OCR output.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Schweppes". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, but both are capitalized the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here because they're identical. 

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, even with the same capitalization and no typos, it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
