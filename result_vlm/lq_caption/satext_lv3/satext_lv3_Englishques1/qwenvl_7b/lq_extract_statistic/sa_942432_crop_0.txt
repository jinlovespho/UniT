gt_text: FARNESIVS
vlm_output: The image provided does not contain any visible English text. It appears to be a low-resolution image of a building with architectural details, possibly a historical or cultural site, but no text is discernible.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FARNESIVS" and the VLM OCR output is a statement that there's no visible English text in the image. 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says there's no text, so the extracted text would be the entire sentence provided. But since the ground truth is "FARNESIVS", which is a Latin name (maybe a person's name), the OCR didn't detect any text. 

Now, Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "FARNESIVS". The OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. The OCR output mentions "English text" but the ground truth isn't in English; it's Latin. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "FARNESIVS" is the only word in the ground truth, and the OCR output doesn't mention that word at all, there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none. Since there are no matches here, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is about the absence of text, it doesn't contain the actual word from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
