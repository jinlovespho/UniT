gt_text: RUELLE
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RUELLE" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "RUELLE", which is a name, probably a French name.

Next, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RUELLE". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, considering the criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But "10%" doesn't contain any letters. The ground truth is all letters. Since the OCR output has no letters, there's no overlap. Also, "10%" is not a typo of "RUELLE" because they are completely different characters. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "10%" can't be a typo of "RUELLE" because they don't share any letters. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
