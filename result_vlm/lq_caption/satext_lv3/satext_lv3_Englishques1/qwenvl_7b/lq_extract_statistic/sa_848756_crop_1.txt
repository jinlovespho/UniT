gt_text: GRUNO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GRUNO" and the VLM OCR output is "TOKYO". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output here is "TOKYO". Then step 2 is to compare that with the ground truth, considering the rules provided.

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "GRUNO", which is a single word. So the unique words here are just "GRUNO". But the OCR output is "TOKYO", which is another single word. 

Now, the comparison needs to consider ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since both are single words without any punctuation or spaces, that part might not affect here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, "GRUNO" vs "TOKYO" – are these considered typos? Well, "GRUNO" isn't a standard English word, but maybe it's a name or a specific term. However, "TOKYO" is a well-known city. 

The key is whether "TOKYO" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has "GRUNO", and the OCR output has "TOKYO". Since there's no overlap between the words, even considering case, typos, etc., they are completely different. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "GRUNO" isn't in "TOKYO" and there's no partial match, this would be category 3. The OCR output is entirely different and unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
