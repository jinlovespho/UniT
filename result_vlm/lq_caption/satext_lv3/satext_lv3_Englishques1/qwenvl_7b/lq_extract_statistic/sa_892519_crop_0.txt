gt_text: DIDZIOJI
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DIDZIOJI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "100%". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The key points are to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

Wait, the ground truth is "DIDZIOJI". Let me check if that's a word I recognize. Hmm, "DIDZIOJI" might be a Lithuanian word, possibly meaning "big" or "large" (since "didžiausias" is "biggest" in Lithuanian). But the OCR output is "100%", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has one unique word: "DIDZIOJI". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number. There's no overlap between "DIDZIOJI" and "100%". Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "DIDZIOJI" in any way. Also, the instructions mention ignoring case, but "100%" is all caps, but that's not the same as the word. 

So, since there's no matching word, it would fall under category 3—incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even if there's a typo, the words are completely different. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
