gt_text: ZK
vlm_output: Air New Zealand

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "ZK" and the OCR output is "Air New Zealand". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, step 1: extract text from OCR output. The OCR output is "Air New Zealand". So the words here are "Air", "New", "Zealand".

Step 2: Compare with ground truth. The ground truth is "ZK". Now, the instructions say to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "ZK" which is two letters. But the OCR output has three words. How do we handle this?

The ground truth is "ZK", which is a two-letter abbreviation. The OCR output is "Air New Zealand". The unique words in the ground truth are just "ZK". So we need to check if "ZK" is present in the OCR output. But the OCR output has "Air", "New", "Zealand". None of these words are "ZK". However, maybe there's a typo? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "ZK" is not present in any form. The OCR output has "Zealand", which is a country name, but "ZK" isn't part of that. 

Wait, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has the words "ZK". The OCR output has "Air", "New", "Zealand". None of these match "ZK". So no words match. Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The ground truth is "ZK", which is two letters. But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be matching the text content, which is "ZK" but the OCR output is "Air New Zealand". So there's no overlap. So the answer would be category 3. But wait, maybe the OCR output is supposed to be "ZK" but it's written as "Air New Zealand". But "ZK" is not a word in the OCR output. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
