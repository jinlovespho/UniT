gt_text: Civic
vlm_output: EXIT 10

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Civic" and the VLM OCR output is "EXIT 10". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is "EXIT 10". 

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Civic". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

First, let's break down the ground truth. The unique words here are just "Civic". The OCR output has "EXIT" and "10". 

Now, check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. "Civic" vs "EXIT" and "10". There's no overlap here. "EXIT" is a different word, and "10" is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a single word, "Civic", which isn't present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one but not all (but there's only one unique word, so if it's not present, then 2 isn't applicable?), or 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since there's no match between "Civic" and the OCR output words, it would fall into category 3. The OCR output is "EXIT 10", which is unrelated to "Civic". Even if we consider typos, there's no way "EXIT" or "10" could be a typo of "Civic". So the answer should be 3.
