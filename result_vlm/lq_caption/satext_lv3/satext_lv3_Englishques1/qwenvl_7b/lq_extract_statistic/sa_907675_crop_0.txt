gt_text: pttstation
vlm_output: pttstation

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "pttstation" and the VLM OCR output is also "pttstation". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "pttstation", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both texts are the same. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "pttstation". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and have no spaces or punctuation, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case because the OCR output is identical to the ground truth.

So, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial correctness or incorrectness here. The answer should be category 1.
