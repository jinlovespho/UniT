<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "EXPRESS" and the OCR output is "PEXPRESS". So, first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "PEXPRESS". 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, it's based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is a single word: "EXPRESS". The OCR output is "PEXPRESS", which is one word as well.

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Then, small typos still count as matches. The OCR output has an extra 'P' at the beginning. So "PEXPRESS" vs "EXPRESS". The original word is "EXPRESS", and the OCR added a 'P' at the start. But the problem says small typos still count as matches. However, the question is whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Wait, the ground truth has only one unique word: "EXPRESS". The OCR output has "PEXPRESS". Is "PEXPRESS" considered a match for "EXPRESS"? Since the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. But adding an extra letter might be considered a typo. However, the exact wording is "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output has a typo that's small, like a missing letter or an extra letter, does that count?

But the ground truth is "EXPRESS" and the OCR output is "PEXPRESS". The OCR has an extra 'P' at the beginning. So the OCR output has "P" + "EXPRESS". If the OCR output is considered to contain the ground truth word, even with an extra letter, then it would be a correct match. But the instruction says that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"EXPRESS"}. The OCR output's unique words are {"PEXPRESS"}.

But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, does "PEXPRESS" contain "EXPRESS" as a substring? If that's considered a match, then maybe it counts. However, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. But adding a letter isn't exactly a typo in the traditional sense. For example, if the OCR had "EXPPRESS" (extra P in the middle), that's a typo. But adding a letter at the beginning might be considered a larger error. However, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches, but it's not clear if adding letters is considered a small typo.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have the same word as the ground truth but with an extra letter. But since the ground truth is "EXPRESS" and the OCR output is "PEXPRESS", which is "P" + "EXPRESS", maybe the OCR output is considered to have the correct word plus an extra letter. However, the instruction says that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "EXPRESS", and the OCR output has "PEXPRESS". Are these considered the same word with a typo? If so, then the unique word in the ground truth is present in the OCR output as a typo, so it would be category 1.

But I need to check the exact wording. The instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth's unique words are {"EXPRESS"}. The OCR output's words are {"PEXPRESS"}. So the question is, does "PEXPRESS" match "EXPRESS" when considering typos? If the OCR output has a typo that's considered a small one, then it counts. But adding a letter at the beginning could be a larger error. However, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches." It's possible that the OCR output is considered to have the correct word with a small typo, so category 1.

Alternatively, if the OCR output is not considered to have the correct word, then it would be category 2 or 3. But since the OCR output is "PEXPRESS" and the ground truth is "EXPRESS", the OCR output is just one extra letter. If that's considered a small typo, then category 1. If not, then maybe category 2. But the instruction says "small typos still count as matches," so I think that's intended to mean that minor errors like adding or missing a letter are acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be category 1.
