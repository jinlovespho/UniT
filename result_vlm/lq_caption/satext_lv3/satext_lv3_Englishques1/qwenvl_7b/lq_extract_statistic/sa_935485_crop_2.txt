Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "11" and the VLM OCR output is also "11". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "11", which is straightforward. Then Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the order was different, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "11", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "11". So the unique words in both are the same. The note says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc. Since both are just "11", there's no issue there. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "11" is present in both, and there's only one unique word, this should be a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
