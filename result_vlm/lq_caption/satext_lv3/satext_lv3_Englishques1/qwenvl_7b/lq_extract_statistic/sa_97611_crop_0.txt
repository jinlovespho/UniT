gt_text: NE
vlm_output: NE 3BRAZILIA

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NE" and the VLM OCR output is "NE 3BRAZILIA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NE 3BRAZILIA". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NE" since it's only one word. 

Now, looking at the OCR output, "NE" is present. The other part is "3BRAZILIA". But the ground truth doesn't have that. However, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "NE" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, the key is whether all unique ground truth words are present. 

The ground truth has only "NE", and the OCR output includes "NE". The other part of the OCR output isn't part of the ground truth, but the instructions say to compare based only on the unique words in the ground truth. So even if there are extra words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo in "NE"; it's exactly as in the ground truth. The "3BRAZILIA" part is an extra word, but that doesn't affect the presence of "NE". 

So since the OCR output contains the ground truth word "NE", even with an extra word, the category should be 1 — Correct.
