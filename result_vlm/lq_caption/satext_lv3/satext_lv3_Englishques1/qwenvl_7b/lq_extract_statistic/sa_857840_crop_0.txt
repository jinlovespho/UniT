gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos either because the OCR output is exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
