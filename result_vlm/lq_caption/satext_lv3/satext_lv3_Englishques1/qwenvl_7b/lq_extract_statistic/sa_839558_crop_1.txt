gt_text: PLH32
vlm_output: PLH32

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLH32" and the VLM OCR output is also "PLH32". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is straightforward because the output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to step 2: comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are single words. So order isn't an issue here. The next point is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PLH32". The OCR output also has "PLH32", so the set matches exactly.

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either. Also, there are no typos mentioned. The OCR output is identical to the ground truth, so even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
