gt_text: 15
vlm_output: There is no English text visible in the provided image.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "15" and the VLM OCR output is "There is no English text visible in the provided image." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the text is "There is no English text visible in the provided image."

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "15". The unique words in the ground truth are just "15" since it's a single number. Now, looking at the OCR output, the words are "There", "is", "no", "English", "text", "visible", "in", "the", "provided", "image." (with a period maybe, but the instructions say to ignore punctuation).

The problem is that the OCR output doesn't have "15" anywhere. It's talking about not seeing English text, which is unrelated to the actual ground truth of "15". The OCR output is saying there's no text visible, but the ground truth is the number 15. So the OCR didn't recognize the number, instead stating there's no text. 

Since the unique word in the ground truth is "15", and that's not present in the OCR output, there are zero matches. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated and doesn't contain the correct word. So the answer should be 3.
