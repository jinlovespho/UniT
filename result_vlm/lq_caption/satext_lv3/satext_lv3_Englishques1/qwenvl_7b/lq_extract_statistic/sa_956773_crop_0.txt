gt_text: BRITISH
vlm_output: BRITISH AIRWAYS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth is "BRITISH" and the VLM OCR output is "BRITISH AIRWAYS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "BRITISH AIRWAYS", so the words here are "BRITISH" and "AIRWAYS".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "BRITISH". The OCR output includes "BRITISH" as the first word. 

Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, so even if the OCR had the words in a different order, it would still count. Also, we only consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has "BRITISH" and the OCR output includes that word, even though there's an extra word "AIRWAYS", that's okay. The rules say to ignore extra words, as long as all the ground truth words are present. 

Capitalization and spacing are ignored, but in this case, both are the same. There are no typos here either. So the OCR output has the correct word "BRITISH" and an extra one, but since the ground truth only requires "BRITISH" to be present, that's a full match. 

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
