gt_text: MARKET
vlm_output: MARKET

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MARKET" and the VLM OCR output is also "MARKET". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MARKET", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MARKET". The OCR output also has "MARKET". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, all unique words (just "MARKET") are present. So the answer should be 1.
