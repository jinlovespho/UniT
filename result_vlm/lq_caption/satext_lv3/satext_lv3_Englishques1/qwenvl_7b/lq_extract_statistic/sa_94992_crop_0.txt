gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: Airbus

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is "Airbus". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Airbus", which is a single word. The ground truth is "QATAR", also a single word. 

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "QATAR". The OCR output has one unique word: "Airbus".

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "QATAR" and "Airbus" are both proper nouns with different capitalizations, but since we're ignoring capitalization, we can compare them as "qatar" and "airbus". But the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"QATAR"}, and the OCR output's unique words are {"Airbus"}.

The next point is about small typos. However, "QATAR" and "Airbus" are completely different words. There's no typo here; they are distinct. So even if we ignore capitalization, "qatar" vs "airbus" are not the same. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Here, "QATAR" isn't in "Airbus", so that's not met. Category 2 is partially correct if at least one unique word matches. Since there's no match, that's not the case either. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "Airbus" is unrelated to "QATAR", this falls into category 3.
