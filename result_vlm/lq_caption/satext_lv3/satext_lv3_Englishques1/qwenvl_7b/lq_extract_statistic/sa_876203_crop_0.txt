gt_text: HELLENIC
vlm_output: HELLENIC SEASER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HELLENIC". The VLM OCR output is "HELLENIC SEASER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The extracted text is "HELLENIC SEASER".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HELLENIC". The OCR output has "HELLENIC" and "SEASER". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth only has one unique word: "HELLENIC". The OCR output has two words, but "HELLENIC" is present. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore capitalization, spacing, punctuation. The OCR output has "HELLENIC" which matches exactly with the ground truth word. The other word "SEASER" isn't in the ground truth, but since the ground truth only has "HELLENIC", the presence of that one word is sufficient. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos in "HELLENIC" here. So the OCR output includes all unique ground truth words. Therefore, category 1 applies.
