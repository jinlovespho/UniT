gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: DALIAN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "DALIAN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "DALIAN".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "DALIAN". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. There's no typo mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, it's category 1. I don't see any issues here. Even if there were a typo, like "Dalian" with lowercase 'l', it would still count as a match because small typos are allowed. But in this case, it's exact. So the answer should be 1.
