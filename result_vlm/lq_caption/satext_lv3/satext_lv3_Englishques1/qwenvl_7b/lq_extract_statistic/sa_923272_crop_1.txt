gt_text: BOSS
vlm_output: BOSS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BOSS" and the VLM OCR output is also "BOSS". 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "BOSS", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word. 

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BOSS". The OCR output also has "BOSS". 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here. 

Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here since both are identical. 

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it fits category 1. 

There's no mention of partial matches or missing words here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
