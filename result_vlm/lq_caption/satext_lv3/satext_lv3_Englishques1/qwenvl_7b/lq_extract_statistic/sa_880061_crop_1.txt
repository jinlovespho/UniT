gt_text: garlando
vlm_output: alfonso garlando

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "garlando" and the VLM OCR output is "alfonso garlando". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "alfonso garlando". So the words are "alfonso" and "garlando".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is just "garlando". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the order. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "garlando".

Now, checking if "garlando" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "garlando" as the second word. So that's a match. The other word in the OCR output is "alfonso", which isn't in the ground truth, but since we're only comparing based on the unique words in the ground truth, that's okay. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are lowercase, so no issues there. There's no typos in "garlando" in the OCR output, so that's a perfect match. 

Since all unique words in the ground truth (just "garlando") are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. Even though there's an extra word "alfonso", the category is determined by whether all ground truth words are present, not whether there are extra words. So the answer is 1.
