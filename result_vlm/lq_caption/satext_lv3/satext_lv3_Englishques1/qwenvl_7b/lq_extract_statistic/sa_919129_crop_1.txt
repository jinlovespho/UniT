gt_text: FONTE
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FONTE" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "100". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

So the ground truth has one unique word: "FONTE". The OCR output is "100", which is numbers. There's no overlap in words here. "FONTE" is a Portuguese word meaning "source", but the OCR output is numbers. Since there are no matching words, even considering typos or case, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. Because none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there was a typo, like "fonTe" vs "FONTE", but here it's completely different. So answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 158
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 372
