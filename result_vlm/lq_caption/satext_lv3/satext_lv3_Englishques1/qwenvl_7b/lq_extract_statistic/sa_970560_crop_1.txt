Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GEOTAB" and the VLM OCR output is also "GEOTAB". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "GEOTAB".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one word: "GEOTAB". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "GEOTAB", and the OCR output contains that exact word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, the answer should be category 1.
