Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "in", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the word "in". The OCR output is exactly "in". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "in". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, that's category 1. 

No typos, no missing words. So the answer should be 1.
