gt_text: HOUSE
vlm_output: 100

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HOUSE". The OCR output has "100", which are numbers. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOUSE". The OCR output has "100", which is a number, not the word "HOUSE". 

Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "100" isn't even a word. Typos are considered matches if they are small, but "100" is a number, not a typo of "HOUSE". 

Since there are no matching words between "HOUSE" and "100", the category should be 3, which is Incorrect. There's no overlap in the words, and the OCR output is unrelated.
