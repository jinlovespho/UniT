gt_text: POSTAGE
vlm_output: POSTAGE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POSTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POSTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "POSTAGE", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "POSTAGE".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POSTAGE". The OCR output also has "POSTAGE". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's no punctuation or spaces. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so there are no typos. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (which they are), it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
