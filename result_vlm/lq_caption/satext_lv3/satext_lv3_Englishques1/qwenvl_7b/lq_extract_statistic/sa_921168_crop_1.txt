gt_text: CENTURY
vlm_output: HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CENTURY" and the VLM OCR output is "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "HOTEL".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The ground truth has one unique word: "CENTURY". The OCR output has "HOTEL".

Now, I need to check if "HOTEL" matches "CENTURY" based on the given criteria. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, both are single words with no punctuation or spaces. However, the words themselves are different: "CENTURY" vs. "HOTEL". There's no overlap in letters or any part of the words. Also, the instructions say small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are entirely different, not just a typo. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't contain that word (even considering typos or case), there are no matches. Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty, this would fall into category 3.
