Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RAILWAY" and the VLM OCR output is also "RAILWAY". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "RAILWAY".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RAILWAY". The OCR output also has "RAILWAY", so that's a match.

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either. The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly correct.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the category should be 1.
