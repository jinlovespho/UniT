Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "8X" and the OCR output is "Airbus". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "Airbus". Then step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the text "8X". 

Now, the categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth here is "8X". Let's break down the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But "8X" is a single word, not multiple words. The OCR output is "Airbus", which is a different word. 

- The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "8X". The OCR output has "Airbus". 

- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But "8X" is all caps? Wait, the ground truth is "8X" which is uppercase, but the OCR output is "Airbus" which is also uppercase. However, the rule says to ignore capitalization, so maybe case doesn't matter. But "8X" is a number and a letter, while "Airbus" is a proper noun. 

- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the words are completely different. "8X" vs "Airbus". There's no overlap in the words. The ground truth's unique word is "8X", and the OCR output has "Airbus". So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since "Airbus" is unrelated to "8X", the answer should be 3.
