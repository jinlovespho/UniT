gt_text: Investors
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Investors" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Investors". 

Now, we need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. The word "Investors" isn't present here. 

But wait, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which doesn't relate to the word "Investors". There's no typo here either because "100%" isn't a variation of "Investors". 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words from the ground truth.
