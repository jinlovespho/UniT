Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "6214" and a VLM OCR output "6214". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "6214", which is the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is straightforward.

Moving to Step 2, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both texts are exactly the same: "6214". Since they are identical, even if word order didn't matter, they would still match perfectly. However, the ground truth is a single number, so there's only one "word" here. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just {"6214"}. The OCR output has the same word. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc. But since there are no letters here, just numbers, those factors don't come into play. Also, there are no typos because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match here, and nothing is missing. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
