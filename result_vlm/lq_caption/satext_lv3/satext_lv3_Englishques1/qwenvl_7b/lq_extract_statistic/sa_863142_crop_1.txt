Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "214" and a VLM OCR output "214". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "214", which is already text, so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "214", which is a single word (assuming numbers are treated as words here). The OCR output is the same, "214", so the unique words match exactly. 

The rules also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are just numbers without any of those, that's not a factor. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here because they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
