gt_text: HUAWEI
vlm_output: HUAWEI

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HUAWEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "HUAWEI". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HUAWEI", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HUAWEI".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in that regard.
- Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here since both are identical.

Now, looking at the categories:
1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, this condition is met.
2 — Slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But here, all (the only one) matches.
3 — Incorrect if no words match or the output is wrong/unrelated/empty. Not applicable here.

So the answer should be category 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 152
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 356
