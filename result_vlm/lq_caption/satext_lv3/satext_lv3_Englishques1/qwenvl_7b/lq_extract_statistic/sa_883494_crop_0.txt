gt_text: JOAN
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JOAN" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "JOAN".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "JOAN". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percent sign. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "100%" has numbers and a symbol, while "JOAN" is letters. There's no overlap in characters here. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but in this case, there's no typo—just completely different content.

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth (even after ignoring case and punctuation), it doesn't match. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3—Incorrect.
