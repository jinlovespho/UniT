vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "058". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence stating that there's no visible English text. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "058", which is a string of numbers. Now, the OCR output mentions "no visible English text," which implies that the OCR didn't detect any text. But the ground truth is actually the number "058", which is text, albeit numeric. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. 

Wait, the ground truth is "058"—is that considered a word? The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "058" is a string of digits. The OCR output says there's no visible English text. So the OCR didn't detect any text, but the ground truth is a numeric string. However, the problem might be considering "058" as a word. 

But the OCR output says there's no visible English text. The ground truth is "058", which is numeric. The OCR output's text is about the absence of English text, not about the presence of numbers. So the OCR output doesn't mention any words that match "058". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one, 3 if none. Since the ground truth is "058", which is a single "word" (assuming numbers are considered words here), but the OCR output doesn't mention any words. So the OCR output's text doesn't contain "058" or any part of it. Therefore, there are no matching words. 

So the answer should be category 3: Incorrect, because the output is largely wrong (it says there's no text, but the ground truth is text, though numeric). However, the problem's instructions might consider numbers as part of text. But the OCR output says "English text," which might not include numbers. So the OCR output is incorrect in that it didn't detect the text "058", which is present in the image. Therefore, the OCR output is wrong, leading to category 3.
