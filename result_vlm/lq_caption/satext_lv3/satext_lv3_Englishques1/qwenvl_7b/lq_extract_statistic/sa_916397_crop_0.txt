gt_text: RATHAUS
vlm_output: 1025

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RATHAUS" and the VLM OCR output is "1025". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "1025". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth is a single word "RATHAUS", which is a German word for town hall. The OCR output is "1025", which looks like numbers. The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Wait, the ground truth has only one unique word: "RATHAUS". The OCR output has "1025", which is numbers. Are numbers considered as words here? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "RATHAUS" is a word, and "1025" is a number. So there's no overlap. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but numbers are not letters. So the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match. The OCR output is numbers, which don't match the word "RATHAUS". Even if there were typos, but here it's completely different. So the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 155
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 361
