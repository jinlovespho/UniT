Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "in".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has the word "in". The OCR output is exactly "in". So the unique words in ground truth are {"in"}. The OCR output has the same word. Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though there's only one word, it matches. So according to category 1, which says all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this should be category 1. There's no discrepancy here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer is 1.
