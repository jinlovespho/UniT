gt_text: Card
vlm_output: Card only

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Card" and the VLM OCR output is "Card only". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Card only". So the extracted text is just that phrase.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "Card", which is a single word. So the unique words here are just {"Card"}.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "Card" (same as ground truth, case-wise) and "only". But since the ground truth only has "Card", we need to check if "Card" is present in the OCR output.
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo in "Card" between the two.

So, the OCR output has "Card" as the first word. The ground truth is "Card". Since the unique words in the ground truth are just "Card", and the OCR output contains that exact word (ignoring case, which isn't an issue here), then according to the criteria, all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, it should be category 1.

Wait, but the OCR output has an extra word "only". However, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "Card", so even if the OCR output has more words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. The extra words in the OCR output don't affect this because the comparison is only about the ground truth words. 

So, the answer should be 1 because "Card" is present in the OCR output, and there are no other unique words in the ground truth to check. The presence of "only" is extra but not relevant here since the ground truth doesn't include it. Therefore, all required words are matched.
