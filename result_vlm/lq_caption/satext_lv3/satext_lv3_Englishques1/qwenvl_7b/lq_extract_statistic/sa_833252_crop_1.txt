Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "easyJet".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet".

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. The OCR output is "easyJet" which is the same as the ground truth. Even if there were typos, like "easyjet" or "easy jet", it would still count as a match because the rules say small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. 

So the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth. Therefore, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match here because there's only one word, and it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
