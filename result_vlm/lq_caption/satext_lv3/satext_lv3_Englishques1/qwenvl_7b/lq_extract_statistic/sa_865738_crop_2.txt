Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "7122" and the VLM OCR output is also "7122". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's already "7122".

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are just numbers, there's no order to consider. The unique words in the ground truth would be the set containing "7122". The OCR output has the same exact text. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "7122" which matches exactly, that's all the unique words needed. The other points like ignoring capitalization and spacing don't apply here because there's no letters or spaces. Typos aren't an issue here since they're the same. So this should be category 1.
