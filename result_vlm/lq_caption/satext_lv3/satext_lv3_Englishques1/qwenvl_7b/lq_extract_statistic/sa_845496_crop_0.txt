gt_text: MOMENT
vlm_output: 10

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MOMENT" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10", which is just the numbers 1 and 0. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "MOMENT". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here the OCR output has numbers, not words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MOMENT" (since it's a single word). 

Now, the OCR output is "10", which doesn't contain the word "MOMENT" at all. The problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "10" is just numbers. There's no mention of numbers in the ground truth. Also, small typos are considered matches, but "10" isn't a typo of "MOMENT"; it's entirely different. 

So, the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique ground truth words. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and not even a partial match. So the answer should be 3.
