gt_text: Midea
vlm_output: Midea

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Midea" and the VLM OCR output is also "Midea". So, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to step 2. The comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Midea". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in the same case here. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. There's no typo either because they're identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (which they are), it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
