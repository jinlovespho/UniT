gt_text: PKP
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PKP" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "PKP", which is an acronym.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PKP". The OCR output is "100%", which is a different word. 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since "PKP" isn't in "100%", there's no match. Also, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which doesn't relate to "PKP". 

Small typos are considered matches, but here it's not a typo; it's a completely different word. So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect.
