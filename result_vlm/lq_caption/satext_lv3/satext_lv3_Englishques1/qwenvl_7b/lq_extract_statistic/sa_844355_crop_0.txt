gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is just "Bank". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bank". The OCR output also has "Bank". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue because there's none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1. There's no case where any words are missing or incorrect. So the answer should be 1.
