Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Hilton" and the VLM OCR output is also "Hilton". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Hilton", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Hilton".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "Hilton". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Hilton". The OCR output also has "Hilton". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here since both are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1: Correct. There's no missing words or mismatches. Even if there were a typo, like "Hiltton", it would still count as a match because small typos are considered correct. But in this case, it's exact. So the answer is 1.
