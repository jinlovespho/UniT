gt_text: Rodeo
vlm_output: Rodeo

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Rodeo" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rodeo". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Rodeo", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Also, small typos are considered matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "Rodeo" is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Since both are identical, there's no issue with capitalization, spacing, or typos. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Rodeo", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

Now, checking the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words or having typos. So the answer should be 1.
