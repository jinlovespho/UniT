gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "LIBERTE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "LIBERTE", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word. 

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LIBERTE". The OCR output also has "LIBERTE". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. I don't see any reason to categorize it as 2 or 3. The answer should be 1.
