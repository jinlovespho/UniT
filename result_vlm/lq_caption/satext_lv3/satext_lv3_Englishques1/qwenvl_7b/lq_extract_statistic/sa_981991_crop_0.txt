Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "287". The VLM OCR output says there's no visible English text, just a snowy landscape with buildings. So, the OCR didn't find any text.

Step 1: Extract text from OCR output. The OCR output mentions "no visible English text" and describes the image. But the ground truth is the number 287. The OCR didn't detect any text, so the extracted text would be the words from the OCR's description. However, the ground truth is a number, not text. Wait, but the problem says to compare based on unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth is "287", which is a number. However, the OCR output is talking about the absence of text. 

Wait, maybe the ground truth is supposed to be text, but in this case, it's a number. But the OCR output says there's no text. So, the OCR didn't find any words, but the ground truth is the number 287. But according to the instructions, we need to compare the unique words in the ground truth. But "287" is a number, not a word. However, the problem might be considering numbers as words here. 

But the OCR output says there's no text, so the extracted text from OCR is the sentence about no visible English text. The ground truth is "287", which is a number. So, the unique words in the ground truth would be "287". The OCR output doesn't have "287" in it. The OCR output mentions numbers? No, it says there's no text, so no numbers. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have the word "287". 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words are present, then it's category 3. Because the ground truth has "287", and the OCR output doesn't have that. So the answer is 3.
