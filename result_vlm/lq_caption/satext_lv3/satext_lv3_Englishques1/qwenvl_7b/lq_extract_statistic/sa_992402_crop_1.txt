gt_text: Bodega
vlm_output: BodegaCANAL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Bodega" and the VLM OCR output is "BodegaCANAL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "BodegaCANAL". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Bodega". The OCR output has "BodegaCANAL". Let's break this down.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But since the ground truth has only one word, "Bodega", and the OCR output has "Bodega" followed by "CANAL", maybe we need to split into words. Wait, the ground truth is a single word, so the OCR output has "Bodega" as the first part and then "CANAL" as another. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Bodega".

So the OCR output's text is "BodegaCANAL". Are "Bodega" and "CANAL" considered separate words here? The OCR output might have merged them without a space. But the instructions mention ignoring extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL", perhaps it's considered as two words: "Bodega" and "CANAL" if we split on word boundaries. However, since there's no space, it's ambiguous. But maybe the OCR output is treated as a single string, and we need to check if the ground truth words are present as substrings, considering case and typos.

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "Bodega". The OCR output has "BodegaCANAL". So "Bodega" is present as a substring. Since the OCR output includes "Bodega" (even though it's followed by "CANAL"), and considering that we can ignore extra spaces and typos, maybe "Bodega" is considered a match. The "CANAL" part is an extra, but since the ground truth only has "Bodega", and the OCR output includes that word, then all unique ground truth words (which is just "Bodega") are present. Therefore, this would be category 1: Correct.

But wait, the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL". Is "Bodega" a standalone word here? If the OCR output is considered as a single word without spaces, then "BodegaCANAL" is one word. But the ground truth is "Bodega". However, the instructions say to compare based on unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains "Bodega" as part of a longer word, does that count? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But in this case, "Bodega" is exactly present as a prefix. However, the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL", which is "Bodega" + "CANAL". Since the OCR output is supposed to be the text extracted, maybe the model's output is "BodegaCANAL" as a single word. But the ground truth is "Bodega", so the OCR output includes "Bodega" as a substring. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth has "Bodega", and the OCR output has "Bodega" as part of a longer string, does that count as a match?

Alternatively, maybe we need to split the OCR output into words. If the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL", perhaps it's considered as two words: "Bodega" and "CANAL" if we split on case changes or something. But that's not standard. Normally, splitting into words would require spaces. Since there are no spaces, maybe it's considered as one word. In that case, the OCR output has one word, which is "BodegaCANAL", which doesn't match "Bodega" exactly. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there's no space, so maybe the OCR output is considered as "Bodega" followed by "CANAL" without a space. But how does that affect the comparison?

The instructions also say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bodega". The OCR output's unique words would be "Bodega" and "CANAL" if we split on the lack of space. But since there's no space, perhaps the OCR output is considered as one word. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL", and the ground truth is "Bodega", then maybe the OCR output is considered as containing "Bodega" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output has "Bodega" as a substring, but not as a standalone word, does that count?

This is a bit ambiguous. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. In this case, the OCR output has "Bodega" as the start of the word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, even if they are part of longer words, then it's correct. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is supposed to have the exact words. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "BodegaCANAL" and the ground truth is "Bodega". Since "Bodega" is a substring of the OCR output, and considering that the OCR might have added "CANAL" as an error, but the main word "Bodega" is present, then it would be considered correct. Therefore, category 1.
