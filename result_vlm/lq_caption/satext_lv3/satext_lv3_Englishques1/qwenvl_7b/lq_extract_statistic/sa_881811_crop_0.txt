gt_text: GLOBUS
vlm_output: GLOBE

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GLOBUS" and the VLM OCR output is "GLOBE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "GLOBE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is a single word: "GLOBUS". The OCR output is "GLOBE".

Now, checking if they match. The words are different: "GLOBUS" vs "GLOBE". But the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. Let's see: "GLOBUS" has letters G, L, O, B, U, S. "GLOBE" is G, L, O, B, E. The difference is the last letter: 'U' vs 'E'. That's a single character typo. Since small typos are considered matches, this would count as a correct match.

Wait, but the categories are based on unique words. The ground truth has one unique word, "GLOBUS". The OCR output has one word, "GLOBE". Since they are considered a match with the typo allowed, then all unique ground truth words (which is just one) are present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 1 applies here.

But wait, is "GLOBE" considered a match for "GLOBUS"? The instruction says small typos still count as matches. So even though they are different words, the typo is small, so it's considered a match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
