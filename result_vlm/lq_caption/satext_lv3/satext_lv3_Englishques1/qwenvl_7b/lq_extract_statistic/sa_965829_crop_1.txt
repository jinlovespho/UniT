gt_text: Only
vlm_output: Only

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Only" and the VLM OCR output is also "Only". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is just "Only".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Only". The OCR output is exactly "Only". So when comparing, since the words are the same, ignoring case (but both are uppercase here), and there's no typos. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, category 1 applies. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
