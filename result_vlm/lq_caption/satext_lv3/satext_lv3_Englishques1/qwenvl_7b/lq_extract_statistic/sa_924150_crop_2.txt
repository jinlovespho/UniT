gt_text: FIT
vlm_output: 2014

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FIT" and the VLM OCR output is "2014". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is "FIT", which is an acronym, likely standing for something like "Fitness" or another term, but as given, it's just the letters F, I, T.

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FIT". The OCR output is "2014", which is a number, not a word. 

Next, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "2014" is a number, not a word. There's no overlap in characters between "FIT" and "2014" except maybe the letter 'I' in "FIT" and the number '1' in "2014", but the rules state that small typos still count as matches. However, "2014" doesn't contain any letters, only digits. The ground truth is letters, so there's no matching characters here. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output has no letters in common with the ground truth, there are no matching words. The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated to the ground truth's letters. Therefore, it falls under category 3 — Incorrect.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 172
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 396
