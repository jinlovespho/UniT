gt_text: Municipio
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Municipio" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Municipio", which is a Spanish word meaning "municipality". The OCR output is "100", which is a number. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Municipio". The OCR output has "100", which is a number, not a word. 

Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "100" is just numbers, so even if we consider it as a string, it doesn't match "Municipio" in any way. There's no overlap in words. 

Small typos still count as matches, but here there's no typo—there's just a completely different type of data (number vs. word). Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "Municipio" or any of its variations, even with typos, the category would be incorrect. 

So the answer should be category 3 because there's no match at all.
