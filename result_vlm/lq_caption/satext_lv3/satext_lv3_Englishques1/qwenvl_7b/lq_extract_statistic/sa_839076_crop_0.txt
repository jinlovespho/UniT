gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here since both are exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since "NIKE" is present and matches perfectly, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
