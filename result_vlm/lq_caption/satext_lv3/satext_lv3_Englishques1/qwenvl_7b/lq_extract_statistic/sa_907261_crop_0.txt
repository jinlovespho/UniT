Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMP701" and the VLM OCR output is "10". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "AMP701".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But wait, the ground truth is a single word "AMP701" and the OCR output is "10". So, maybe I should split them into words? But "AMP701" is one word, and "10" is another. Let me check the criteria again.

The second point says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "AMP701". The OCR output is "10", which is a single word. Now, we need to check if "10" matches "AMP701" considering the other factors.

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "AMP701" is a mix of letters and numbers, while "10" is just numbers. The problem says small typos still count as matches, but I'm not sure if "10" is considered a typo of "AMP701". 

Wait, "AMP701" has letters A, M, P and numbers 7, 0, 1. The OCR output is "10", which is numbers 1 and 0. There's no overlap in the letters (A, M, P) between the two. The only numbers present in the ground truth are 7, 0, 1. The OCR output has 1 and 0, but missing the 7. However, the problem states that small typos count as matches. But "10" is not a typo of "AMP701"; it's missing most of the characters. 

Since the ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has a different word that doesn't contain any of the letters from the ground truth, there's no match. Therefore, according to category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be category 3.
