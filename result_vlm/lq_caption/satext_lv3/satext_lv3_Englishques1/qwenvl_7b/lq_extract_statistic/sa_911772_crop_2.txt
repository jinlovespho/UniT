gt_text: SHACK
vlm_output: SHACK

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "SHACK" and a VLM OCR output "SHACK". They want me to determine the category based on the comparison rules given.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SHACK", so that's straightforward. The ground truth is also "SHACK". 

Now, moving to Step 2. The comparison needs to consider a few factors. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

Let's break it down. The ground truth has one word: "SHACK". The OCR output is exactly the same. So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "SHACK". The OCR output has "SHACK" as well. 

Since the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly, even though we're supposed to ignore case, but here both are uppercase. But even if there was a case difference, like "shack" vs. "SHACK", it would still count as a match. Also, there are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present.
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect otherwise.

In this case, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. So, it should fall into category 1. There's no ambiguity here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so all conditions are met for category 1.
