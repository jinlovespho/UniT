gt_text: MEDONTARIO
vlm_output: The image provided does not contain any visible English text. It appears to be a low-resolution image of a ship, but there is no discernible text on the ship or in the surrounding area.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MEDONTARIO". The VLM OCR output says there's no visible English text in the image, just a low-res ship. So the OCR didn't find any text.

Step 1: Extract text from OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence stating there's no text. The actual words here are "The", "image", "provided", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text", "It", "appears", "to", "be", "a", "low-resolution", "image", "of", "a", "ship", "but", "there", "is", "no", "discernible", "text", "on", "the", "ship", "or", "in", "the", "surrounding", "area."

But the ground truth is "MEDONTARIO", which is a single word. The OCR output doesn't mention any words related to "MEDONTARIO". The OCR says there's no text, so it's not detecting any words. 

Now, comparing the unique words in the ground truth (which is just "MEDONTARIO") to the OCR output. The OCR output has words like "text", "image", "ship", etc., but nothing that matches "MEDONTARIO". Even if we consider typos, there's no close match. The OCR output is saying there's no text, so it's not detecting the word. 

So, the category would be 3 because none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is largely wrong or unrelated since it claims there's no text, but the ground truth says there is. Therefore, the answer is 3.
