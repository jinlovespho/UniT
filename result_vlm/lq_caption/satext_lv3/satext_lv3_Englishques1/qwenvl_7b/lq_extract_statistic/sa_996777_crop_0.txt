gt_text: GOVERNADOR
vlm_output: 1920

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GOVERNADOR" and the VLM OCR output is "1920". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1920", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "GOVERNADOR", which is a Portuguese word meaning "governor".

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth considering the given factors. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word, "GOVERNADOR". The OCR output is "1920", which is numbers. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are just "GOVERNADOR". Now, the OCR output is "1920", which is numbers. Are numbers considered as words here? The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but the OCR output is numbers. The ground truth is a word, so there's no overlap. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. But the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. The OCR output is "1920", which is not a word in the ground truth. So there are no matches. 

So according to category 3: Incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1920" is unrelated to "GOVERNADOR", it's category 3.
