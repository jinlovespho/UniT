gt_text: OVO
vlm_output: OVO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "OVO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OVO". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OVO".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. The word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But since both are "OVO", the order is the same here.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OVO". The OCR output also has "OVO". So, the unique words match exactly.

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either.

Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here because both are identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, this fits Category 1. 

There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. It's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
