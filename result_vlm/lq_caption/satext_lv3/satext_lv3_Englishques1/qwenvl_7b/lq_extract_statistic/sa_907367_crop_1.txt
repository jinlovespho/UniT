gt_text: GR
vlm_output: GR

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "GR" and the VLM OCR output is also "GR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "GR".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are just two letters, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "GR" (assuming it's one word). The OCR output also has "GR", so they match exactly.

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so no problem. No punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. There's no typo because they are identical. 

Since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer is 1.
