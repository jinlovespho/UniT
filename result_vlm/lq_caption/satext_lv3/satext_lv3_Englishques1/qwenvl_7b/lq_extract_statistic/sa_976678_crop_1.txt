gt_text: MERIDIANAS
vlm_output: SAILING

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "MERIDIANAS" and the VLM OCR output is "SAILING". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SAILING", which is straightforward. Next, compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified factors: word order doesn't matter, only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "MERIDIANAS". Let me check if there are any unique words here. Since it's a single word, "MERIDIANAS", the set of unique words is just {"MERIDIANAS"}.

Now, the OCR output is "SAILING", which is a single word. The comparison is between "MERIDIANAS" and "SAILING". Since the unique words in the ground truth are only "MERIDIANAS", we need to see if "SAILING" matches that. 

But "SAILING" and "MERIDIANAS" are completely different words. There's no overlap in the words. Even considering small typos, they don't resemble each other. So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
