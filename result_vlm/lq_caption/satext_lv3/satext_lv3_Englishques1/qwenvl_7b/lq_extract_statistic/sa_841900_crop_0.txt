gt_text: San
vlm_output: San

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "San" and the VLM OCR output is also "San". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "San". Then, I compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "San". The OCR output also has "San". Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "San") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
