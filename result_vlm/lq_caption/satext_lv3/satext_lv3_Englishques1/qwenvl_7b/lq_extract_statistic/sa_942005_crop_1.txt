Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "V10" and the VLM OCR output is also "V10". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "V10", that's straightforward. Then step 2 involves comparing with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, only unique words from the ground truth. Also, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth has one unique word: "V10". The OCR output is exactly the same. So, when comparing, since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, even if there were typos, it's considered a match. But here, there are no typos. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "V10") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
