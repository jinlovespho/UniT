gt_text: 365
vlm_output: U.S. NAVY

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "365" and the VLM OCR output is "U.S. NAVY". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "U.S. NAVY". Then compare it with the ground truth, considering the rules. 

The ground truth is "365". The unique words here are just "365". The OCR output has "U.S. NAVY". Let's break it down. The OCR output has words "U.S." and "NAVY". The ground truth is a single number. 

Now, according to the rules, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "365". The OCR output has "U.S." and "NAVY". None of these match "365" even when considering case, spacing, or typos. The OCR output is completely unrelated. 

So, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "U.S. NAVY" doesn't contain "365" or any variation, it's category 3.
