gt_text: EXIT
vlm_output: 1

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EXIT" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "EXIT". The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EXIT". 

Now, the OCR output is "1". The instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but here the OCR output is a number, not a word. Also, small typos still count as matches, but "1" isn't even a typo of "EXIT". 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But "1" doesn't contain "EXIT" or any variation of it. 
- Category 2 is partially correct if at least one word matches. However, there's no match here. 
- Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1" is a number and not related to "EXIT", this falls under category 3.

So the answer should be 3.
