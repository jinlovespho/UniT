gt_text: UNO
vlm_output: UNO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNO" and the VLM OCR output is also "UNO". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Now, comparing them based on the given criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. Next, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UNO". The OCR output also has "UNO". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. Punctuation and spaces aren't a factor here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
