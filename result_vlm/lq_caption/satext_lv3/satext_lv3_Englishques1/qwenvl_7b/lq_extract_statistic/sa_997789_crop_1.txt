gt_text: PONANT
vlm_output: PONANT

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PONANT" and the VLM OCR output is also "PONANT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "PONANT".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth has the word "PONANT". The OCR output is the same. Since they are identical, all unique words (which is just "PONANT") are present. Even if there were minor typos, like "Ponant" or "ponant", it would still count as a match. Here, there are no typos, so it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's category 1. There's no case difference, no extra spaces, and no missing words. So the answer should be 1.
