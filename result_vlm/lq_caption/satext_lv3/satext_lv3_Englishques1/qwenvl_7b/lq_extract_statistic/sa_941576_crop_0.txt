gt_text: ARNOLD
vlm_output: ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ARNOLD" and the VLM OCR output is "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ARNOLD". The OCR output has two words: "ARNOLD" and "HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "ARNOLD", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the OCR output, "ARNOLD" is indeed there. The other word, "HUNTERSCULPTOR", isn't part of the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking for the presence of the ground truth words. 

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if there were more words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Also, capitalization and spacing are ignored, but in this case, the OCR output has "ARNOLD" exactly as in the ground truth. There's no typo here, so that's a perfect match. 

Since all unique ground truth words (just "ARNOLD") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1. The presence of an extra word doesn't affect this because the criteria are about including all ground truth words, not excluding extra ones. Even if there were typos, like "ARNOLD" being "ARNOLd", it would still count as a match. Here, it's exact, so definitely category 1.
