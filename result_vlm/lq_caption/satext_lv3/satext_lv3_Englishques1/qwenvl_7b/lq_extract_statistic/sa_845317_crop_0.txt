gt_text: TEATRO
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TEATRO" and the VLM OCR output is "TEATRO SOLIS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "TEATRO SOLIS", which is two words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth, which is just "TEATRO". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "TEATRO".

Now, I need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The "TEATRO" is present, which matches the ground truth. The extra word "SOLIS" isn't in the ground truth, but the instructions say to ignore extra words. The key is whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since "TEATRO" is there, even though there's an extra word, it's still a correct match.

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The capitalization is the same, and there's no punctuation to ignore. The spacing is different (ground truth has one word, OCR has two), but the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So the presence of "TEATRO" in the OCR output, even with an additional word, is sufficient for category 1.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
