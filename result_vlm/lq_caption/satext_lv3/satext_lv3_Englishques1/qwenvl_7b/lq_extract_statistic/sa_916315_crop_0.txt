gt_text: WOW
vlm_output: WOW

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "WOW" and a VLM OCR output "WOW". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "WOW", which is straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "WOW", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "WOW". Since both are the same, there's no issue with typos, capitalization, or spacing. The unique words in the ground truth are just "WOW". The OCR output contains exactly that word. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. 

I need to make sure there's no oversight. Are there any typos? No, they're identical. Are there extra spaces or punctuation? No. The word order doesn't matter here, but since there's only one word, order isn't an issue. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
