gt_text: LEBEN
vlm_output: 1028

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LEBEN" and the VLM OCR output is "1028". I need to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1028", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is the word "LEBEN", which is a German word meaning "life".

Now step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "LEBEN". The OCR output is "1028", which is numbers, not letters. 

The criteria mention that we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output here is entirely numeric, which doesn't match any letters. Also, the rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no letters at all. 

So, the ground truth has the word "LEBEN", but the OCR output has numbers. There's no overlap in the characters or words. Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth (even considering typos or case), this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. The output is largely wrong and unrelated. Even if we consider that maybe "1028" could be a typo for "LEBEN", but since it's numbers and not letters, it's not even close. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
