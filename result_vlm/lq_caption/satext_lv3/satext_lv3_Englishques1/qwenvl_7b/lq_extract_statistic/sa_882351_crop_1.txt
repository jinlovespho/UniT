gt_text: FedEx
vlm_output: FedEx

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FedEx" and the VLM OCR output is also "FedEx". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since it's exactly "FedEx".

Next, compare with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "FedEx". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. Typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique ground truth words are present. That should be category 1. The answer is 1.
