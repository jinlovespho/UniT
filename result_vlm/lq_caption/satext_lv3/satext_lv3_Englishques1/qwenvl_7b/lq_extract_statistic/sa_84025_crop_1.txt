gt_text: ESCALATOR
vlm_output: 10%

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "ESCALATOR" and the OCR output is "10%". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR, which is "10%". Then compare it with the ground truth.

First, the unique words in the ground truth are just "ESCALATOR". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "ESCALATOR" isn't in "10%". The OCR output has numbers and a symbol, which don't match the word. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "10%" is a number and symbol, not a word. So there's no match. 

The categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word in the ground truth and it's not in the OCR output, it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches here. So it's category 3, which is incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
