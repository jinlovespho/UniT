gt_text: movistar
vlm_output: movistar

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "movistar" and the VLM OCR output is also "movistar". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "movistar", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "movistar". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

I should check if there are any differences in capitalization, but both are lowercase. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to ignore here. Also, there are no typos since they're identical.

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present (which they are), it's category 1. So the answer should be 1.
