gt_text: 1945
vlm_output: FALLS PARK

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1945" and the VLM OCR output is "FALLS PARK". So I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "FALLS PARK". So the extracted text is just that.

Step 2 is comparing with the ground truth. The ground truth is "1945". Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "1945", which is a number. So the unique words in the ground truth would be just "1945" as a single word? Or maybe it's considered as four separate digits? Hmm, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth", so maybe "1945" is treated as a single word here.

Then, the OCR output is "FALLS PARK", which has two words: "FALLS" and "PARK". Now, comparing the unique words from the ground truth (which is "1945") with the OCR output's words. The OCR output doesn't have "1945" in any form. The words are "FALLS" and "PARK", which don't match "1945" even if we ignore case, punctuation, etc. Because "1945" is a number, and the OCR output has words that are not numbers. So there's no overlap in the unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("1945") and the OCR output has none of that, then it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "FALLS PARK" can be a typo for "1945" because they are entirely different types of words. So the answer should be 3.
