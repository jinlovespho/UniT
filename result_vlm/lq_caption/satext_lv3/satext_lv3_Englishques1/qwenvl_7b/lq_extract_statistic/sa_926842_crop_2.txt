gt_text: OCBC Bank
vlm_output: 101

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OCBC Bank" and the VLM OCR output is "101". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "101".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "OCBC" and "Bank". 

Now, I have to check if these words appear in the OCR output. The OCR output is "101", which is a string of numbers. The words "OCBC" and "Bank" are not present here. Even if I consider typos, the OCR output doesn't have any letters, just numbers. 

The categories are as follows: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 
- Category 2 is for partial matches. 
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated outputs.

Since the OCR output has no letters and the ground truth words are all letters, there's no overlap. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
