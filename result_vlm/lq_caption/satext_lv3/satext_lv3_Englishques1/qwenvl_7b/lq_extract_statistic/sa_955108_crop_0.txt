Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NIKE", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are just one word. The ground truth has the word "NIKE", and the OCR output is also "NIKE". 

Next, they mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". So the unique words match.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; it's exactly the same.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because all required words are there. So the answer should be 1.
