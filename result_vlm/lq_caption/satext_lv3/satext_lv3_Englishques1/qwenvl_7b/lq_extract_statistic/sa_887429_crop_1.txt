gt_text: DISTRICT
vlm_output: MEATPACKING DISTRICT

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DISTRICT" and the OCR output is "MEATPACKING DISTRICT". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "MEATPACKING DISTRICT", so the words here are "MEATPACKING" and "DISTRICT".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "DISTRICT". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "DISTRICT", we need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, "DISTRICT" is there exactly as in the ground truth, even though there's an extra word "MEATPACKING". The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should ignore extra words. Also, capitalization and spacing are ignored. So "DISTRICT" is present in the OCR output.

The category is determined by whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "DISTRICT", and that's present in the OCR output, this would be category 1 — Correct. Even though there's an extra word, the presence of the required word is sufficient. The other rules about typos don't apply here because there's no typo in "DISTRICT". So the answer should be 1.
