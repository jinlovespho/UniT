gt_text: FM
vlm_output: AMFM

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FM" and the VLM OCR output is "AMFM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "AMFM", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "FM". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "FM" (assuming it's a single word here, maybe an abbreviation). Wait, but "FM" is two letters, but in the OCR output, it's "AMFM". Let me think: the ground truth is "FM", which is one word. The OCR output is "AMFM" which is one word as well. But maybe splitting into letters? Wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". So "FM" is a single word. The OCR output is "AMFM" which is a single word. 

But the comparison is based on the set of unique words. The ground truth has the word "FM". The OCR output has the word "AMFM". Now, the question is whether "AMFM" contains the ground truth word "FM" as a substring, or if they are considered as separate words. Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has the word "FM". The OCR output's words would be "AMFM" (assuming it's one word). 

But the instruction says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. So, "AMFM" vs "FM". If we split "AMFM" into possible words, maybe "AM" and "FM"? But the original OCR output is "AMFM" as a single word. Wait, but maybe the OCR output is a single token, and the ground truth is a single token. So "FM" vs "AMFM". Are they considered as matching? 

The problem says that small typos still count as matches. But "AMFM" is longer than "FM". However, since the ground truth is "FM", and the OCR output has "AMFM", which includes "FM" as a substring. But does that count? The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "FM" as a unique word. The OCR output has "AMFM" as a unique word. Are these considered a match? 

Wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth's unique words are {"FM"}. The OCR output's unique words are {"AMFM"}. Now, the comparison is whether all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "FM" is not exactly present in "AMFM" as a word. However, maybe "AMFM" contains "FM" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on words, not substrings. So if "FM" is a word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has "AMFM" as a word, then "FM" is not a word in the OCR output. Unless the OCR output is split into "AM" and "FM", but the original OCR output is "AMFM" as a single word. 

Wait, but the step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the OCR output is "AMFM". Then, step 2 is to compare with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output is one word. The ground truth is one word. So the question is, does "AMFM" contain "FM" as a word? If the OCR output is considered as a single word, then "AMFM" is not the same as "FM". However, if the OCR output is split into "AM" and "FM", then "FM" is present. But the problem doesn't mention splitting the OCR output into words; it just says to extract the text content. 

Alternatively, maybe "AMFM" is considered as two words: "AM" and "FM". If that's the case, then the OCR output has "FM" as a word, which matches the ground truth. But how do we know if "AMFM" is split into two words? The problem doesn't specify any splitting rules. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, so maybe the OCR output is considered as a single word, but with possible typos. 

But the example given in the problem: if the ground truth is "FM" and the OCR output is "AMFM", then considering that "FM" is a substring of "AMFM", but the problem says that small typos still count as matches. However, "AMFM" is not a typo of "FM"; it's longer. But maybe the OCR output has an extra "A" at the beginning. If "AMFM" is a typo where an "A" was added before "FM", then "FM" is still present. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. 

Alternatively, maybe "AMFM" is considered as containing "FM" as a part of it. But the instructions don't mention substrings, only words. So if the OCR output is "AMFM" and the ground truth is "FM", then unless "AMFM" is split into "AM" and "FM", which would make "FM" present, but the problem doesn't specify splitting. 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "FM". The OCR output's text is "AMFM". If we consider "AMFM" as a single word, then it doesn't contain "FM" as a separate word. However, if "AMFM" is split into "AM" and "FM", then "FM" is present. But how to determine splitting? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe the OCR output is considered as a single token. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single token, and the ground truth is "FM", which is a single token. In that case, they are not the same, so the category would be 3. But that seems harsh. However, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. If "AMFM" is considered as a typo of "FM", but that's not a small typo. Adding an "A" and an "M" makes it longer. 

Alternatively, maybe "AMFM" is a typo where "A" was added before "FM", but the main part is "FM". However, the problem says that small typos count, but "AMFM" is not a small typo. It's adding two characters. So maybe it's not considered a match. 

In that case, the OCR output doesn't contain "FM" as a word, so the category would be 3. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the ground truth is "FM", and the OCR output is "AMFM". If we ignore capitalization and spaces, but the OCR output is "AMFM" which is a single word. The ground truth is "FM". The OCR output has "FM" as part of the word. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. So unless the OCR output is split into words, "FM" is not a separate word. 

Therefore, the answer would be category 3 because the OCR output does not contain the ground truth word "FM" as a separate word. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if "AMFM" is considered as containing "FM" as a substring, but the problem says to compare based on words, not substrings. So I think the correct answer is 3. But I'm confused because maybe "AMFM" is split into "AM" and "FM", making "FM" present. However, without explicit splitting rules, it's unclear. But given the instructions, I think the answer is 3.
