gt_text: USAirmail
vlm_output: 13+ USAirmail

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "USAirmail" and the VLM OCR output is "13+ USAirmail". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "13+ USAirmail". So the extracted text would be "13+ USAirmail".

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, following the given rules. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "USAirmail". 

Now, looking at the OCR output, "13+ USAirmail". The unique words here are "13+" and "USAirmail". The ground truth's unique word is "USAirmail". So "USAirmail" is present in the OCR output. 

The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, "USAirmail" in the OCR output matches exactly with the ground truth, even though there's a "13+" before it. Since the OCR output includes the correct word, even with an additional part, the presence of "USAirmail" is sufficient. 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are no typos. The word is exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "USAirmail" is present, the answer should be 1.
