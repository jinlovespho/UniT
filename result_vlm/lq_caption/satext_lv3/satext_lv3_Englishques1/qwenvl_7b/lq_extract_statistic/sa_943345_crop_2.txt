gt_text: INS
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth "INS".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. But here, the ground truth is "INS" which is three letters. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage sign. 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. The ground truth has "INS" as a single word. The OCR output has "10%", which doesn't contain any letters from "INS". 
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But there's no overlap here. 
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "10%" has no letters in common with "INS", there's no match. 

Even considering typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "INS" in any way. So the correct category is 3.
