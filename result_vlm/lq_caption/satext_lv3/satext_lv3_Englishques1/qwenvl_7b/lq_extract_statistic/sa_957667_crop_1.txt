gt_text: liv
vlm_output: SIX

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "liv" and the VLM OCR output is "SIX". So I need to compare these two according to the steps given.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SIX", so that's straightforward. Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth is "liv".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "liv" which is a single word. So the unique words in ground truth are just {"liv"}.

Now, the OCR output is "SIX". Let's check if there's any match. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, so "SIX" in lowercase is "six". But the ground truth is "liv". Are "six" and "liv" considered matches? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "six" and "liv" are completely different words. There's no typo here; they are different letters. So even with ignoring capitalization, there's no match. 

So the unique words in OCR output are {"six"}, which doesn't include "liv". Therefore, none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
