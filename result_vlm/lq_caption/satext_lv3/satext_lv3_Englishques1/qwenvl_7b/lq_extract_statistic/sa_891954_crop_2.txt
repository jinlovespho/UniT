Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "101" and the VLM OCR output is also "101". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "101", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "101".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "101". The OCR output is the same. Let's break down the unique words. Wait, "101" is a single word here. Both the ground truth and OCR output have the same word. So all unique ground truth words (which is just "101") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since they are exactly the same, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, and the order doesn't matter here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
