gt_text: NEMO
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NEMO" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to compare these two according to the given steps.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "NEMO", which is a word, probably a name. 

Now, Step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth has only one word: "NEMO". The OCR output is "100", which is numbers, not letters. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

So, the ground truth has "NEMO" as the unique word. The OCR output has "100", which is numbers. Since "100" isn't a word that matches "NEMO" in any way (even with typos, capitalization, etc.), there's no match. The OCR output is completely different, unrelated. Therefore, it falls into category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible typo or substitution. For example, if "100" was supposed to be "NEMO" but the OCR misread letters as numbers. However, "NEMO" is four letters, and "100" is three digits. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "100" can be a typo for "NEMO" because they are different lengths and characters. So no match here. So the answer is 3.
