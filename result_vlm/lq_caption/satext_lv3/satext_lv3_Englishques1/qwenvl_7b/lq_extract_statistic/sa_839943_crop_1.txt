Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "36" and the VLM OCR output is "47". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "47", which is straightforward. Then step 2 involves comparing with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, and looking at unique words. But wait, both "36" and "47" are just numbers. Are they considered as words here?

The categories mention unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "36". The OCR output has "47". Now, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. But "36" vs "47" aren't typos of each other. They're different numbers. So, does that mean they don't match?

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "36" and the OCR has "47", there's no match. So category 3 would be incorrect. But wait, maybe the problem is that both are single numbers, and maybe the system is considering them as words. But since they are different, no match. So category 3 applies here. But I need to make sure. The instructions say "ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces" but here, they are both just numbers with no spaces. But since the actual content is different, even if they are numbers, they are not the same. So category 3.
