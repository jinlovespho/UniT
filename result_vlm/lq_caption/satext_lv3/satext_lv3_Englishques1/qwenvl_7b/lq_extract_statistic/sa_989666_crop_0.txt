gt_text: COTTAGE
vlm_output: 100

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "COTTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is "100". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "COTTAGE".

Now step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "COTTAGE". The OCR output is "100", which is numbers, not letters. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the OCR output isn't even letters. So there's no word in the OCR output that matches "COTTAGE" even with typos. Since "100" is numbers, it's not a typo of the word. So there are no matches for the unique ground truth word.

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, there are none. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it's not category 2. Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100" is unrelated to "COTTAGE", this should be category 3.
