gt_text: M
vlm_output: M

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "M" and the VLM OCR output is also "M". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "M". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same single character.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has one unique word, "M", and the OCR output also has "M". Since they match exactly, even considering the rules about ignoring case, spacing, etc., which aren't an issue here. There are no typos, so it's a perfect match. 

No other words are involved, so there's no partial match. Therefore, this should be category 1.
