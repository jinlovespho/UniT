Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "28" and the VLM OCR output is also "28". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "28".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "28". The OCR output has the same word. 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing—there's nothing to ignore here because both are the same. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but in this case, there are no typos. 

So all unique ground truth words (which is just "28") are present in the OCR output. That means it's a correct match. The category should be 1.
