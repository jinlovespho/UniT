Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "30" and the VLM OCR output is "100". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "100", so that's straightforward. Then Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering the specified factors.

The categories are 1, 2, or 3. The key points for comparison are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the ground truth is "30" and the OCR output is "100". 

Wait, the ground truth is a single number, "30", so the unique words here are just "30". The OCR output is "100", which is a single number. Now, comparing them. Are they considered matches? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "30" vs "100" – they are different numbers. There's no overlap in digits. The ground truth is "3" and "0", but the OCR output is "1", "0", "0". So the unique words in ground truth are {"30"}, and the OCR output is {"100"}. Since they are different, there's no match. Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 3. 

But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "30" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "100". Since "100" is not the same as "30", even if they share a '0', but the entire word isn't a match. The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But "30" and "100" aren't typos of each other. A typo would be like "30" vs "3o" or "30" vs "300" maybe. But "100" is a different number. So there's no match. Hence, category 3: Incorrect.
