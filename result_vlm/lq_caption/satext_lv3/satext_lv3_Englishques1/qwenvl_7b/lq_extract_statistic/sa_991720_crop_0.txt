gt_text: SPEEDWAY
vlm_output: 1

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPEEDWAY" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SPEEDWAY". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is "1", which is a numeral, not the word "SPEEDWAY". 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since "SPEEDWAY" is the only unique word in the ground truth, and the OCR output doesn't have that word, it's not matching. 

Category 2 is for partial matches. But since the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth (it's a number instead), there's no partial match here. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output here is "1", which is unrelated to "SPEEDWAY" and doesn't contain any of the words. So, this would fall under category 3.
