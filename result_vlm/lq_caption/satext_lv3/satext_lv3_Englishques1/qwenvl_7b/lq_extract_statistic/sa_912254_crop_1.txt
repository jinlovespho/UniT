gt_text: CHASE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHASE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, moving to Step 2, we need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "CHASE". The OCR output is "100%". Let's break down the comparison. The ground truth's unique words are {"CHASE"}. The OCR output's text is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. Now, the key here is whether "100%" contains any of the words from the ground truth when considering the specified factors.

Looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of the word "CHASE" or any variation of it. The OCR output is entirely numerical and a symbol. Even if we consider ignoring punctuation, "100%" becomes "100", which is still not related to "CHASE". Also, the problem states that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no attempt to spell "CHASE" at all. The OCR output is completely different in terms of content.

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth, even after considering all the allowed variations (case, spacing, punctuation), the category would be 3—Incorrect. There are no matches, and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
