gt_text: 03
vlm_output: "Let's Party!"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "03", and the VLM OCR output is "Let's Party!". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Let's Party!".

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "03". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is "03", which is a number, not a word. So, the unique words in the ground truth would be just "03" as a single word. However, the OCR output is "Let's Party!", which has two words: "Let's" and "Party".

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore case, punctuation, and extra spaces. Let's process both texts. The ground truth is "03" – no punctuation or spaces. The OCR output is "Let's Party!" – if we remove punctuation, it becomes "Let's Party". Then, ignoring case, it's "let's party".

But the ground truth is "03", which is a number. The OCR output has words that are not numbers. The problem mentions comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, "03" is not a word but a number. The OCR output has words like "Let's" and "Party", which don't match "03" in any way, even with typos. 

The categories are:
1 – Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output.
2 – Partially correct.
3 – Incorrect.

Since the ground truth's unique word is "03" and the OCR output has no matching words, even after considering typos, case, etc., it would fall into category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, which is a number, while the OCR output is a phrase with words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
