gt_text: FRESH
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth is "FRESH" and the OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is the word "FRESH".

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say to compare the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRESH". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. But "FRESH" isn't in "10%". 
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one word in the ground truth, and it's not present, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "10%" is unrelated to "FRESH" and there's no match, this would be category 3.

I should also check if there's any possible typo or if "10%" could be a misinterpretation of "FRESH". But "10%" is a number, not a word. The OCR might have failed to recognize the letters, so it's not a typo but an entirely different output. Therefore, no words match, so it's category 3.
