gt_text: DUBLIN
vlm_output: DUBLIN73826

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DUBLIN" and the VLM OCR output is "DUBLIN73826". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "DUBLIN73826". So, the extracted text would be "DUBLIN73826". 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, following the given criteria. The ground truth has only one unique word: "DUBLIN". The OCR output starts with "DUBLIN" followed by numbers. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in the ground truth, that's straightforward. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has just "DUBLIN".

Now, I need to check if "DUBLIN" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output starts with "DUBLIN" exactly, so that's a match. The numbers after it don't affect the comparison because we're only looking for the presence of the ground truth words. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, the OCR output is all uppercase, same as the ground truth, so no issue there. There are no extra spaces or punctuation in the OCR output that would affect the match. 

Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos in "DUBLIN" in the OCR output; it's exactly the same. The numbers after don't interfere with the match for "DUBLIN".

Since the OCR output contains the exact word "DUBLIN" (even though there are numbers after), and the ground truth only has "DUBLIN", this should be considered a correct match. Therefore, category 1 applies here.
