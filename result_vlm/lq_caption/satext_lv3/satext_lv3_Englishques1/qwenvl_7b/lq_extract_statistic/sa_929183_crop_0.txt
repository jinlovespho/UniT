gt_text: EQUINOX
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EQUINOX" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the numbers 1 and 0 with a percent sign. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "EQUINOX". 

Now, the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR output is "10%", which is numbers and a symbol. The ground truth is a word with letters. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "EQUINOX" is letters, and the OCR output has numbers and a percent. There's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider "10%" as a typo or something, "EQUINOX" isn't present. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one unique word matches. But there are no matching words here. The OCR output doesn't have any of the letters from "EQUINOX" as words. The words in the OCR output are "10%" which are numbers and a symbol, not words. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is "10%", which is unrelated to "EQUINOX", and no words match, this falls under Category 3.
