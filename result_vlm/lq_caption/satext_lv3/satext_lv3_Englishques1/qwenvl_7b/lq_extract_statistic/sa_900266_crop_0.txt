gt_text: CHINA
vlm_output: CHINA EASTERN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth is "CHINA" and the VLM OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "CHINA EASTERN", so the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "CHINA" because it's a single word. The OCR output has two words: "CHINA" and "EASTERN".

Now, comparing the sets. The ground truth's unique words are {"CHINA"}. The OCR output has {"CHINA", "EASTERN"}. Since "CHINA" is present in both, that's a match. The other word in the OCR output, "EASTERN", isn't in the ground truth, but the rules say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we check if all the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "CHINA" is there, and there are no other words in the ground truth, that means all unique ground truth words are present. 

The categories say that if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Even though there's an extra word in the OCR output, the rules mention that extra words are allowed as long as the required ones are there. Also, the rules mention ignoring extra spaces, which isn't an issue here. Typos aren't present here either. So this should be category 1.
