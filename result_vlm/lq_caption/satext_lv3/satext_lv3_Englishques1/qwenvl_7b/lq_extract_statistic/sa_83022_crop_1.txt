gt_text: PLAZA
vlm_output: MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLAZA" and the VLM OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". So, the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "PLAZA". The rules say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "PLAZA", the unique words are only "PLAZA".

Now, I need to check if "PLAZA" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". Let me look for "PLAZA" in there. The string "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR" can be split into "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR" if we consider the words. However, the OCR output is a continuous string without spaces. But the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So, even if there are no spaces, we can consider the words as being concatenated. 

But wait, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "PLAZA" as the only unique word. So, does "PLAZA" exist in the OCR output? Let's check. The OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". If we split it into possible words, "PLAZA" is present as a substring. However, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output includes "PLAZA" exactly as in the ground truth. 

So, the OCR output contains the word "PLAZA" (assuming that the OCR output is considered as a concatenation of words, even without spaces). Therefore, the unique word "PLAZA" from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 1, since all unique ground truth words (only "PLAZA") are present in the OCR output. 

Wait, but the OCR output has more words. But the ground truth only has "PLAZA". The rule says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, as long as all those words are present in the OCR output, regardless of other words. So even if the OCR output has extra words, as long as the ground truth's unique words are present, it's category 1. 

So, in this case, "PLAZA" is present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 1.
