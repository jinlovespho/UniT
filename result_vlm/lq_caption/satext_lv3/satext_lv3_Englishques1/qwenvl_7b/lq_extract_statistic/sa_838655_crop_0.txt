gt_text: iPhone

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "iPhone" and the VLM OCR output is also "iPhone". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "iPhone", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "iPhone".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, both are exactly the same. The ground truth is "iPhone" and the OCR output is the same. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "iPhone". The OCR output has "iPhone" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like "iPhon" or "iPhonne", but in this case, it's exact. So according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique words match. 

No issues here. The answer should be 1.
