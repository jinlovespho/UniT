gt_text: 724
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "724" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "1970". Now, the ground truth is "724". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, "724" is a single number, so the unique words here are just ["724"]. 

The next point is to check if the OCR output contains all the unique ground truth words, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. However, the OCR output is "1970", which is a different number. The question is whether "1970" contains "724" as a word. But "1970" doesn't have "724" in it. Even if we consider typos, "1970" isn't a typo of "724" because they are different numbers with different digits. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no matching words to the ground truth's "724", the category should be 3. There's no overlap in the words, so it's completely incorrect.
