gt_text: AirAsia
vlm_output: AirAsia

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AirAsia" and the VLM OCR output is also "AirAsia". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since it's exactly "AirAsia".

Next, compare with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "AirAsia". The OCR output also has "AirAsia". 

Now, checking for case, punctuation, spaces. The original has "AirAsia" with capital A and lowercase letters. The OCR output is the same. So no issues there. Also, no extra spaces or missing letters. The typos part says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 1 applies. The answer should be 1.
