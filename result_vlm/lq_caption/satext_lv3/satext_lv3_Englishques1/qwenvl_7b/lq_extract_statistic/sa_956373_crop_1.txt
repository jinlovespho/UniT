Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEACH" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to categorize this into one of the three categories based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "BEACH". 

Now, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BEACH". The OCR output is "100", which is numbers. Are numbers considered words here? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words, but "100" isn't a word. Also, the categories mention that if no words match, it's category 3. 

But wait, the OCR output is "100", which is not a word. The ground truth is "BEACH", which is a word. Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth (since "100" isn't a word), then according to the criteria, this would be category 3: Incorrect. Because there's no match. Even if we consider typos, but "100" isn't a typo of "BEACH". It's unrelated. So category 3.
