gt_text: Keep
vlm_output: !

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Keep" and the VLM OCR output is "!". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just an exclamation mark, which is a punctuation symbol, not a word. So the extracted text is "!".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Keep". The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Keep". 

Now, the OCR output is "!", which is not a word. The rules say to ignore punctuation, but wait, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output has no words, just punctuation. So, there are no matching words here. 

Also, the categories are: Category 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has no words, it can't have "Keep". Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But in this case, none match. So Category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated or empty. The OCR output is "!", which is empty in terms of words, so it's Category 3.
