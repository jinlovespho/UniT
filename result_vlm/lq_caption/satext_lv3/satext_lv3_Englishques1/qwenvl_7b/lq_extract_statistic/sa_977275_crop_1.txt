gt_text: OXYGEN
vlm_output: OXYGEN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OXYGEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "OXYGEN". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward.

Next, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OXYGEN". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue here. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about since it's a single word. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
