gt_text: CHUNCHEON
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHUNCHEON" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is a place name, "CHUNCHEON". 

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CHUNCHEON". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percent sign. 

Next, I need to check if there's any match. The rules mention that we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "CHUNCHEON" is a proper noun, a place, and "100%" is a numerical value. There's no overlap in the words here. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "CHUNCHEON" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "CHUNCHEON" in any way. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if no words match or output is wrong/unrelated/empty.

Since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique word, and the output is unrelated (a percentage vs. a place name), this would fall into category 3. There's no partial match here either because the OCR didn't capture any part of the actual word. Even if there was a typo, like "CHUNCHEON" being misread as something similar, "100%" is entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
