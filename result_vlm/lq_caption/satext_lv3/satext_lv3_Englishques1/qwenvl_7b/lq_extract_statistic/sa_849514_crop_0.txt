gt_text: MAPFRE
vlm_output: HARPER

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "MAPFRE" and the OCR output is "HARPER". I need to compare these based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's "HARPER". Then compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MAPFRE". The OCR output has "HARPER". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, does "HARPER" contain "MAPFRE"? No, they are different words. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. No typos since they are different words. So no matches. 

So the category would be 3 because no words match. The output is unrelated. So answer is 3.
