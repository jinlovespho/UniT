gt_text: LEADS
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LEADS". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a statement that there's no visible English text in the image. So the actual text extracted here is "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "LEADS". The categories are based on whether the OCR output includes the unique words from the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is just one word: "LEADS". The OCR output is saying there's no text, so it's not mentioning "LEADS" at all.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "LEADS", we need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output doesn't mention "LEADS" at all. It's stating that there's no text, which is the opposite. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 
But here, the OCR output doesn't have "LEADS". So even if we ignore case, etc., it's not present. So the OCR output is saying there's no text, which is incorrect because the ground truth is "LEADS". 

So the OCR output is completely wrong. The category would be 3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since the OCR output is stating there's no text, but the actual text is "LEADS", which is not mentioned. Therefore, category 3.
