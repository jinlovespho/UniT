Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPORTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "SPORTAGE".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SPORTAGE". The OCR output also has the same word. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here since they are identical.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
