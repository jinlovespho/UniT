gt_text: EESTI
vlm_output: ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EESTI" and the VLM OCR output is "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE", which are two names. The ground truth is "EESTI", which is a single word. 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EESTI". The OCR output has two words: "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE". 

Next, I need to check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. The ground truth word is "EESTI". The OCR words are "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE". Neither of these look similar to "EESTI". Even if I consider typos, there's no overlap. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match. Since there are no matches, the category should be 3. The OCR output doesn't have any words that match "EESTI", so it's incorrect.
