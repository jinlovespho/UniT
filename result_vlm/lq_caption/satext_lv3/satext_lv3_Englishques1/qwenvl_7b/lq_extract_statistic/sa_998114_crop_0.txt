Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "24" and the VLM OCR output is also "24". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "24", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "24", and the OCR output also has "24". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But here, both are exactly the same. There are no typos mentioned. So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "24" is the only word and it's present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

No typos, no missing words, and the output isn't empty. So the answer should be 1.
