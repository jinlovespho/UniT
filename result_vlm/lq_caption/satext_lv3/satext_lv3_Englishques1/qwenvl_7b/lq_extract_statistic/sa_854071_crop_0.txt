gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has "NANTES". 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are all caps and no spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words are present, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or incorrect stuff. The answer should be 1.
