gt_text: TOKYO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOKYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "TOKYO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "TOKYO", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same word, so order isn't an issue. The next point is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TOKYO". The OCR output also has "TOKYO". 

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned here, so the small typos rule doesn't apply here. 

Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, all unique words (just one here) are present. According to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. 

So the answer should be 1. There's no ambiguity here because both texts are identical. Even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. Therefore, it's a perfect match and falls under category 1.
