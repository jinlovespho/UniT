gt_text: Murray

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "Murray" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1970", which is a number. The ground truth is the name "Murray". 

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Murray". The OCR output has "1970", which is a number, not a word. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the OCR output is entirely numeric, which isn't a word. Also, the ground truth is a proper noun (a name), and the OCR output is a year. There's no overlap in the words. 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo because the OCR output isn't even a word. So, "1970" doesn't contain "Murray" in any form. 

According to the categories: 
1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, "Murray" isn't present in "1970", so it's not category 1.
2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it can't be category 2.
3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1970" is unrelated to "Murray", this falls under category 3.

So the answer should be category 3.
