gt_text: N3
vlm_output: WOW

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "N3" and the VLM OCR output is "WOW". 

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is "WOW". 

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "N3". Wait, but "N3" is a single token here. The OCR output is "WOW", which is three letters but not matching "N3".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. But here, the ground truth is a single word, and the OCR output is another single word. So we need to check if "WOW" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just "N3". 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "WOW" and "N3" are both uppercase, but the ground truth might be in any case. However, the ground truth is "N3" which is a mix of letter and number. The OCR output is "WOW", which is all letters. 

The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. But "WOW" isn't a typo of "N3". They are completely different. There's no overlap in characters. So the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. 

So according to the categories: category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "WOW" doesn't contain "N3" and they are unrelated, the answer should be 3.
