gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: SOLD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "SOLD" and a VLM OCR output "SOLD". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SOLD", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are exactly "SOLD". 

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SOLD". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. There's no mention of typos here, but since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, typos aren't an issue here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, all unique words (just "SOLD") are present. 

Therefore, the category should be 1. I don't see any reason to categorize it as 2 or 3 here. The comparison meets all the criteria for category 1.
