gt_text: P

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "P" and the VLM OCR output is "1025". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1025", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is just the single character "P".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth here is only one word: "P". The OCR output is "1025", which is a number, not the letter "P".

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has "P", but the OCR output has "1025". Since "1025" isn't "P" and there's no mention of "P" in the OCR output, there's no match. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But here, there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present in the OCR output. So that doesn't apply. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1025" is unrelated to "P", this would fall under category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. However, the OCR output is "1025" which is a number, and the ground truth is a letter. There's no way "1025" can be considered as "P" even with typos. So, no match. Hence, category 3.
