gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: CROWN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CROWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "CROWN". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "CROWN", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CROWN". The OCR output also has "CROWN". 

We need to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. Also, there are no typos since both are identical. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (which they do), it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. 

So the answer should be 1.
