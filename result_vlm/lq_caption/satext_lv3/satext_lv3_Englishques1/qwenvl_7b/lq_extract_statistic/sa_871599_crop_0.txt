Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "42" and the VLM OCR output is also "42". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "42", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are just "42", so order isn't an issue.

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "42". The OCR output also has "42". So, the unique words match exactly. 

The criteria also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to consider, and the spacing is the same (no spaces at all). 

Small typos are mentioned to still count as matches. However, there are no typos here since both are exactly "42". 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, this fits Category 1. 

There's no possibility of Category 2 here because even though the example is simple, if there was a partial match, it would be Category 2. But since it's a full match, it's definitely Category 1. Category 3 would be if there were no matches or the output was unrelated, which isn't the case here.

So, the answer should be Category 1.
