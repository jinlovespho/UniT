Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "nike" and the VLM OCR output is also "nike". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "nike", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "nike".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "nike". The OCR output has "nike" as well. So they match exactly.

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. The other conditions like ignoring case, spacing, etc., don't affect here because both are the same. No typos either. So the answer should be 1.
