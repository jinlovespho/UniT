gt_text: ИНФОРМАЦИЯ
vlm_output: 1998

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ", which is Russian for "information". The VLM OCR output is "1998". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just the numbers 1998. Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is a single word, "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ", which is all letters, no numbers. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "ИНФОРМАЦИЯ", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. But the OCR output is "1998", which is numbers. There's no overlap in terms of words. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but here it's not a typo—it's completely different characters. Also, ignoring capitalization and punctuation, but the OCR output has numbers, which aren't letters. So there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since there's no matching word, it's category 3.
