Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "154" and the VLM OCR output is also "154". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "154", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "154". The OCR output is the same. So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "154". The OCR output has "154" as well. Since they are exactly the same, there's no issue with typos, order, or spacing. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, and it's a match, that should be category 1. There's no case difference, no extra spaces, and no typos. So the answer should be 1.
