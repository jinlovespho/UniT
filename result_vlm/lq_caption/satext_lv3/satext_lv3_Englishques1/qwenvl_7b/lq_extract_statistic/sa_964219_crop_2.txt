gt_text: HEAD
vlm_output: HEAD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HEAD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HEAD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "HEAD".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly "HEAD".

Next, the comparison is based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HEAD". The OCR output also has "HEAD". So they match exactly.

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are uppercase "HEAD" with no spaces or punctuation. So no issues there.

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or no match here. So the answer should be 1.
