gt_text: Duke
vlm_output: DukeUNIVERSITY

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Duke" and the VLM OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "DukeUNIVERSITY". So, the extracted text is just that string.

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Duke", which is a single word. The OCR output has "Duke" followed by "UNIVERSITY" without any spaces. But according to the instructions, word order doesn't matter, and we should consider unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Duke".

Now, checking if "Duke" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output starts with "Duke", so that's a match. Even though "UNIVERSITY" is added, the presence of "Duke" is there. Also, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has "Duke" exactly as in the ground truth, just followed by another word. 

Since the ground truth has only "Duke" and the OCR output includes that word, even though there's an extra part, the category would be 1 — Correct. Because all unique ground truth words (just "Duke") are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. The extra "UNIVERSITY" doesn't affect the match for the ground truth word. 

So the answer should be category 1.
