gt_text: UNESCO
vlm_output: KFC

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "UNESCO" and the OCR output is "KFC". I need to compare these based on the given steps.

First, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "KFC". Then step 2 is to compare with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "UNESCO". The OCR output has "KFC", which is a different word. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But "UNESCO" isn't in "KFC". So that's not a match. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But there are no matches here. The OCR output has no words that are in the ground truth. So category 3 would be incorrect. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
