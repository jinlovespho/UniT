gt_text: 24
vlm_output: no parking

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "24", and the VLM OCR output is "no parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "no parking". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has the words "24". Wait, but "24" is a number, not a word. But according to the instructions, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, "24" is a single token. But the OCR output is "no parking", which are two words. 

Wait, maybe the ground truth is a single word "24", and the OCR output is "no parking". So, the unique words in ground truth are {"24"}, and the OCR output has {"no", "parking"}. 

Comparing the sets, there's no overlap. So, the OCR output doesn't have "24" in it. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. But wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches". But in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output is completely different. 

So the answer should be category 3, because none of the unique words from ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though "no parking" is a different concept, the words don't match. So category 3 is incorrect.
