gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "POLIZEI".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both texts are the same. The ground truth has one word, "POLIZEI", and the OCR output is the same word. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one unique word here, and it's exactly matched, that should be category 1. There's no issue with typos, order, or anything else. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
