gt_text: PINEAPPLE
vlm_output: PINEAPPLE & HONEY SOAP

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PINEAPPLE" and the VLM OCR output is "PINEAPPLE & HONEY SOAP". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PINEAPPLE & HONEY SOAP". So the extracted text would be those words.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PINEAPPLE". 

Now, I need to check if "PINEAPPLE" is present in the OCR output. Looking at the OCR output, the first word is "PINEAPPLE", so that's a match. The other words in the OCR output are "HONEY" and "SOAP", which aren't in the ground truth. But since the ground truth only has "PINEAPPLE", and the OCR output includes that word, even with additional words, it should still count as correct.

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, the OCR output uses an ampersand (&) instead of "and", but since we're only looking for the presence of "PINEAPPLE" and not the other words, that doesn't affect the match. Also, the case is all uppercase in both, so no issue there.

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in "PINEAPPLE" here. The OCR output has the exact word. 

Since all unique words in the ground truth (just "PINEAPPLE") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
