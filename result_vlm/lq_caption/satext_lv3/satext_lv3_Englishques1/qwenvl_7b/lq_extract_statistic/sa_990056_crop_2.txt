gt_text: EI-DEC
vlm_output: Airbus

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EI-DEC" and the VLM OCR output is "Airbus". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is simply "Airbus", so that's straightforward.

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "EI-DEC", which is one word. Wait, but maybe it's split into parts? Let me check the original question again. The ground truth text is given as "EI-DEC", which is a single string. The OCR output is "Airbus", which is another single word.

Now, the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc. But the ground truth is "EI-DEC" and the OCR output is "Airbus". Let's see if there's any overlap. The ground truth has "EI" and "DEC" if we split by hyphen, but the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "EI-DEC" as a single word? Or is it split into "EI" and "DEC"? The original instruction says "unique words in the ground truth", so maybe "EI-DEC" is considered as one word. But if that's the case, then the OCR output is "Airbus", which is a different word. So no match. But maybe the hyphen is considered a separator? Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth text is "EI-DEC", which is one word. The OCR output is "Airbus", which is another word. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"EI-DEC"}, and the OCR output has {"Airbus"}. There's no overlap. Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3.

But wait, maybe the hyphen in "EI-DEC" is considered as a separator, splitting it into "EI" and "DEC". However, the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. If "EI-DEC" is treated as one word, then splitting it would be incorrect unless specified. The problem doesn't mention splitting on hyphens, so I think it's safer to treat "EI-DEC" as a single word. Therefore, the OCR output "Airbus" doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, leading to category 3.

Alternatively, if "EI-DEC" is considered as two words "EI" and "DEC", then the OCR output "Airbus" doesn't have either of those. Still, no match. So regardless of splitting, there's no match. Hence, category 3.
