gt_text: 8
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "8". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the text content is that entire sentence.

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number 8. The OCR output is saying there's no text visible. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth is "8", which is a single character. The OCR output has words like "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text." 

Wait, the ground truth is "8" which is a number. The OCR output is talking about no text. So the OCR output isn't mentioning the number 8 at all. The unique words in the ground truth are just "8". The OCR output has none of that. 

So according to the categories: category 3 is incorrect if no words match or output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is saying there's no text, which is unrelated to the actual ground truth which is the number 8. So the answer should be 3.
