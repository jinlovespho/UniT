gt_text: SST
vlm_output: The image provided is too low resolution to read any text clearly. It appears to show a kite with a pattern, but no discernible text can be made out. If you have a higher-resolution version of the image or more context, please provide it so I can assist further.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SST", and the VLM OCR output is a longer paragraph explaining that the image is too low resolution to read any text clearly. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions things like "low resolution", "kite with a pattern", "no discernible text", etc. But there's no mention of "SST" or any similar words.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "SST". The OCR output doesn't have any of those words. The user instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "SST" is the only unique word here, and it's not present in the OCR output, there's no match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Since there are no matches, the category should be 3.
