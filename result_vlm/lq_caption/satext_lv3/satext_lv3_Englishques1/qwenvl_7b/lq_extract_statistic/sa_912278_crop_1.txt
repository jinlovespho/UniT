gt_text: Treasures

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Treasures" and the VLM OCR output is "1000". So, step one is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "1000". Now, comparing that to the ground truth.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Treasures". The OCR output is "1000", which is a number. So, the OCR output doesn't have the word "Treasures" in it. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and typos. But "1000" is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a word, and the OCR output is numbers. So there's no match here. The category would be 3 because there are no words matching. Even if we consider typos, "1000" isn't a typo of "Treasures". It's unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
