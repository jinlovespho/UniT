gt_text: SAM'S
vlm_output: SAM'S TOWN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SAM'S" and the VLM OCR output is "SAM'S TOWN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "SAM'S TOWN", so the words here are "SAM'S" and "TOWN".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "SAM'S". The OCR output includes "SAM'S" as the first part and then "TOWN". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has {"SAM'S"}. The OCR output has {"SAM'S", "TOWN"}. 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "SAM'S" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word "TOWN", the category would be 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "SAM'S") are there. 

But wait, the instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we're only comparing the unique words from the ground truth. So even though the OCR has an extra word, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

Also, the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Here, "SAM'S" is the same in both. The extra "TOWN" doesn't affect the presence of the ground truth word. 

So the answer should be category 1.
