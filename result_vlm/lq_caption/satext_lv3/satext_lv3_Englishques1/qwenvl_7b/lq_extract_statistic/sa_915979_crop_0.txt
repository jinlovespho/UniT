Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "€9.00" and the OCR output is "2014". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is just numbers. The ground truth has a currency symbol (€) and a number with a decimal point (9.00). 

Now, step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth's unique words are "€" and "9.00". The OCR output is "2014", which is a number. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But the OCR output has "2014" which doesn't include the euro symbol or the 9.00. So none of the ground truth words are present. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "2014" is unrelated to the ground truth's "€9.00", it's probably category 3. But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo—there's just a complete mismatch. The OCR output is a different number and lacks the currency symbol. So no words match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
