gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD BLVD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has only one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has two words: "HOLLYWOOD" and "BLVD". 

Now, considering the rules: we check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "HOLLYWOOD", which is exactly present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "BLVD", isn't part of the ground truth, but since we're only checking for the presence of the ground truth's words, that's okay. 

Even though the OCR output has an extra word ("BLVD"), the key is whether all the ground truth words are there. Since "HOLLYWOOD" is present, and there are no typos in that word (assuming "HOLLYWOOD" in the OCR is correct), the category should be 1 — Correct. 

I need to make sure that the extra word doesn't affect the category. The problem states that we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even if there are extra words in the OCR output, as long as all the ground truth words are there, it's correct. 

Also, checking for typos: the OCR's "HOLLYWOOD" matches exactly the ground truth, so no typos here. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
