gt_text: OUTBACK
vlm_output: OUTBACK

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "OUTBACK" and a VLM OCR output "OUTBACK". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "OUTBACK", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth is "OUTBACK", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "OUTBACK". Since both are the same, even if we consider case, but the problem says to ignore capitalization. However, in this case, both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. There are no typos here because the OCR output matches exactly. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. 
2 — Partially correct if at least one but not all. 
3 — Incorrect otherwise.

Since the ground truth has one unique word, "OUTBACK", and the OCR output has the same word, all unique words from the ground truth are present. Therefore, it should fall into category 1. 

I need to make sure there's no hidden trick here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so even if there were other factors, they don't apply here. No typos, no missing words, no extra words. So the answer should be 1.
