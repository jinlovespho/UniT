gt_text: MANG
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MANG" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just numbers and a percentage sign. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "MANG". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is a single word: "MANG". 

Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "10%", which consists of the numbers 1 and 0, and a percentage sign. The word "MANG" isn't present here. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any letters at all—it's purely numerical. So even if I consider ignoring punctuation, the letters M, A, N, G aren't there. 

Also, the note says that small typos still count as matches. However, since there's no letters in the OCR output, there's no possibility of a typo related to the ground truth word. 

So, the unique word in the ground truth is "MANG", which isn't present in the OCR output. Therefore, there are no matching words. 

Looking at the categories: 
1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. 
2 is if at least one but not all. 
3 is if none match or the output is unrelated. 

Since there's no match, the category should be 3.
