gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: SHAKERS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHAKERS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "SHAKERS".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "SHAKERS" which is one word. The OCR output is the same word. So the unique words in ground truth are just "SHAKERS". The OCR output has "SHAKERS" as well. Since they are the same, even though capitalization is ignored, but here they are both uppercase, so no issue. No typos, no extra spaces. So all unique words from ground truth are present in OCR output. Therefore, category 1 applies here. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
