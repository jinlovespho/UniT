gt_text: REBOQUE
vlm_output: NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "REBOQUE" and the VLM OCR output is "NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO". I'll split this into individual words. Let's see: "NO", "GESTICULACIÓNEN", "ESTE", "TRÁNSITO". Wait, "GESTICULACIÓNEN" might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "GESTICULACIÓN EN" but merged into one word. But according to the instructions, we should ignore extra/missing spaces and typos. So maybe that's considered as "GESTICULACIÓN EN" but as one word. However, the ground truth is "REBOQUE", which is a single word.

Now, the ground truth has only one unique word: "REBOQUE". The OCR output has four words: "NO", "GESTICULACIÓNEN", "ESTE", "TRÁNSITO". The task is to check if any of the unique words in the OCR output match the ground truth's unique words, considering case, typos, etc. 

Looking at the OCR words: "NO" doesn't match "REBOQUE". "GESTICULACIÓNEN" is a long word, but "REBOQUE" is different. "ESTE" and "TRÁNSITO" are also not matching. Even if there are typos, like maybe "GESTICULACIÓNEN" is supposed to be "REBOQUE" but that seems unlikely. The OCR output doesn't have "REBOQUE" in any form. So none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth word. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3: Incorrect.
