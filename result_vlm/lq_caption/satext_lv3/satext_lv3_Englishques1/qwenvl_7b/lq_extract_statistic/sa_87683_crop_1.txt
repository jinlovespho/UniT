gt_text: CONVERSE
vlm_output: CONVERSE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "CONVERSE" and the VLM OCR output is also "CONVERSE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "CONVERSE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "CONVERSE". The OCR output also has "CONVERSE". Since they are the same, considering case doesn't matter, and there are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (even if there are extra words, but in this case, there are none), it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, even with the same capitalization, it's still a correct match. The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but here there are no typos. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
