gt_text: next
vlm_output: next

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "next" and the VLM OCR output is also "next". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "next", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "next". The OCR output is exactly "next". So, the unique words in the ground truth are {"next"}. The OCR output has the same word. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (even though there's only one word), this should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no discrepancy here. Even if there were minor typos, like "nex" or "nxt", it would still count, but in this case, it's exact. So the answer is category 1.
