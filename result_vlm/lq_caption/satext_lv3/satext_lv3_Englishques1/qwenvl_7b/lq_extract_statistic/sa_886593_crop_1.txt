Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "15" and the VLM OCR output is also "15". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "15", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "15". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "15" since it's a single number. The OCR output is exactly the same: "15". So, when comparing, since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, and considering all the factors (no typos, same order, same case, no extra spaces), it seems like it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word here, and it's present, that should be Category 1. Categories 2 and 3 are for partial or no matches. Since there's no discrepancy here, the answer should be 1.
