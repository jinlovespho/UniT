gt_text: Bull
vlm_output: Red Bull

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth is "Bull" and the OCR output is "Red Bull". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "Red Bull". Then compare it to the ground truth, considering the given rules.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Bull". The OCR output has "Red" and "Bull". Since we're ignoring word order, case, spacing, and typos, "Bull" is present in the OCR output. Even though there's an extra word "Red", the key is that all unique words from the ground truth (which is only "Bull") are present. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, it's category 1. Even though there's an extra word, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "Bull" is there, it should be correct. The presence of "Red" doesn't affect it because the ground truth doesn't have that word. So the answer is 1.
