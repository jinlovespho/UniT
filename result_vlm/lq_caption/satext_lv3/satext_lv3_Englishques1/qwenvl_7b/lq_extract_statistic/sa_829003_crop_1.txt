Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES" and the VLM OCR output is "1025". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1025", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "EMPLOYEES". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EMPLOYEES". The OCR output is "1025", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "1025" isn't a word related to "EMPLOYEES". Also, small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just a number where a word should be. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any words from the ground truth, even considering the rules, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match at all. The output is unrelated and not empty, but it's a number instead of the expected word. So the answer should be 3.
