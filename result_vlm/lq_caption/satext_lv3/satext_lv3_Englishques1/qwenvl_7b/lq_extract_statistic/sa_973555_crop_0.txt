Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "AMP".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "AMP", which is a single word. The OCR output is the same. Since they are identical, all unique words (just "AMP") are present. So according to category 1, which says all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, typos. Here, there's no difference. So the answer should be category 1.
