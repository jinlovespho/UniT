Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PKL" and the VLM OCR output is also "PKL". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "PKL".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the words "PKL". The OCR output is the same. Since they're identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PKL", and the OCR output has that same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, and it's exactly matched, that's category 1. There's no case difference, no missing words, no extra words. So the answer should be 1.
