gt_text: POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLITIE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLITIE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "POLITIE", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POLITIE". The OCR output also has "POLITIE". 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "POLITIE") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words or typos. The answer should be category 1.
