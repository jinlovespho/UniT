gt_text: 2017
vlm_output: Santo Domingo

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2017", and the VLM OCR output is "Santo Domingo". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Santo Domingo", which is a proper noun, likely referring to the capital of the Dominican Republic. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "2017". The ground truth is a year, so it's a numerical value. Now, according to the instructions, I need to check if the OCR output contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth here is "2017", which is a single word (though it's a number). However, the OCR output is "Santo Domingo", which are two words. 

The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth only has one unique word: "2017". The OCR output has two words: "Santo" and "Domingo". Neither of these words are present in the ground truth. 

Also, considering the rules: ignore case, punctuation, spaces, etc. But "2017" is a number, not a word. The OCR output has no numbers. So there's no overlap in words. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Hence, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." 

So the answer should be 3.
