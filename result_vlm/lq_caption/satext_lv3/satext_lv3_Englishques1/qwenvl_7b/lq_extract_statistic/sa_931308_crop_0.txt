gt_text: Platform

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Platform" and the VLM OCR output is "Platform 1". So I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "Platform 1". Then compare it with the ground truth, considering the rules. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Platform". The OCR output has two words: "Platform" and "1". Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present. "Platform" is definitely there. The other word in OCR is "1", but the ground truth doesn't have that. However, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we only check if "Platform" is present in the OCR output. Since it is, even though there's an extra "1", that doesn't matter. The category would be 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "Platform") are present. The extra word in OCR doesn't affect this since we're only checking the ground truth's words. So the answer should be 1.
