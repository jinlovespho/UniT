gt_text: D
vlm_output: 3986 D

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "D" and the VLM OCR output is "3986 D". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "3986 D". So the extracted text would be "3986 D". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "D". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "D". 

Now, looking at the OCR output, there's "3986" and "D". The "D" is present, which matches the ground truth. The "3986" is a number, but the ground truth is a letter. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "D" is in the OCR output, even though there's an extra number, the presence of "D" is what matters here.

The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But in this case, the OCR output has "D" which is the same as the ground truth. The "3986" is extra, but since we only need to check the unique words from the ground truth, which is "D", and that's present, the OCR output meets the criteria for category 1. 

Even though there's an extra number, the problem states that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output has the correct word "D" with no typos. So the answer should be category 1.
