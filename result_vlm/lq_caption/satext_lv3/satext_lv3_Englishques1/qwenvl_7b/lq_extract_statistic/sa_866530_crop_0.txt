gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: MUSEUM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is also "MUSEUM". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MUSEUM". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and single word. So they match exactly. Even if there were typos, like "Museam", the note says small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos.

So all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique words match. So the answer should be 1.
