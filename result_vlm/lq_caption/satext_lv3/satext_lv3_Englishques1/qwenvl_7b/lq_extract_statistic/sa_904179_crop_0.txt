gt_text: STUDENT
vlm_output: STUDENT CENTER

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "STUDENT" and the VLM OCR output is "STUDENT CENTER". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "STUDENT CENTER". So, the extracted text is just that, right? No need to do anything else here.

Step 2 is the comparison. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So, I don't have to worry about the sequence of words. Then, it says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "STUDENT", which is a single word. So the unique words in the ground truth are just {"STUDENT"}.

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, the OCR output is "STUDENT CENTER". The ground truth is "STUDENT". The OCR output has an extra word "CENTER", but the main thing is whether the ground truth words are present. Since "STUDENT" is in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "STUDENT". The OCR output includes "STUDENT" as the first word. So, even though there's an extra word, the presence of "STUDENT" in the OCR output should count. The rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos; the word is exactly the same. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "STUDENT" and that's present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

Wait, but the OCR output has an extra word. But the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output's words are "STUDENT" and "CENTER". The ground truth's unique words are {"STUDENT"}. So all of them (just "STUDENT") are present. Therefore, category 1 applies. 

I don't see any issues here. The presence of an extra word doesn't affect the comparison because the criteria only require that all unique ground truth words are present. The extra words in the OCR output are irrelevant for this check. So the answer should be 1.
