gt_text: M&S
vlm_output: M&S

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "M&S" and the VLM OCR output is also "M&S". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "M&S", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same: "M&S". So the words here are just "M" and "S" if we split by the ampersand? Wait, but maybe "M&S" is considered a single entity here. Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me check the instructions again.

The categories are based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "M&S". So what are the unique words here? If we split by spaces, but there are no spaces. So maybe "M&S" is considered a single word. Or maybe it's split into "M" and "S" with the & as a separator? Hmm, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "M&S", then the unique words would be "M" and "S"? Or is "M&S" considered a single word?

Wait, the example might help. If the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, then it should be category 1. But I need to make sure. Let's think about the rules again. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "M&S", and the OCR output is also "M&S", then the set of unique words in the ground truth is {"M&S"}? Or is it split into "M" and "S"?

This is a crucial point. If "M&S" is considered a single word, then the OCR output has that same word, so it's a correct match. But if it's split into "M" and "S", then the OCR output has both, so that would also be correct. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are whatever they are. If the ground truth is "M&S", then maybe the words are "M" and "S", but that depends on how the splitting is done. But the problem doesn't mention splitting on any characters, so perhaps "M&S" is considered a single word.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "M&S" and the ground truth is also "M&S", so they are exactly the same. Then, since all unique words (which is just "M&S") are present, it's category 1. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, there are no typos. So the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Therefore, it should be category 1. 

Another point: the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there are no spaces, and the case is the same. So nothing to adjust here. 

Therefore, the answer is category 1.
