gt_text: TOKYU
vlm_output: east

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TOKYU" and the VLM OCR output is "east". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "east".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The ground truth has the words "TOKYU", but since it's a single word, the unique words in the ground truth are just "TOKYU". 

Now, I need to check if "east" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. But "east" is a completely different word. There's no overlap here. The OCR output doesn't have "TOKYU" in any form, even considering case, typos, etc. The ground truth is "TOKYU", which is a proper noun, possibly a company or place name. The OCR output is "east", which is a direction. There's no match between the two words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are no matching words, the answer should be category 3.
