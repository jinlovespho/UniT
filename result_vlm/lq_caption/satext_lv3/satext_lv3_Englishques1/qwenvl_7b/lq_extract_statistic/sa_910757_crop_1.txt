Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "1057" and a VLM OCR output of "1057". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules given.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1057", which is already just text, so that's straightforward. The ground truth is also "1057". 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both texts are single numbers. Since they're the same, order isn't an issue here. Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "1057". The OCR output is also "1057", so the set of unique words is the same. 

The instructions also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, there are no capitals, punctuation, or spaces. The texts are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not a factor.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are "1057", the unique word in the ground truth is present in the OCR output. Therefore, it should be category 1.

I need to make sure there's no trick here. The ground truth and OCR output are identical. The rules don't mention anything about numbers specifically, but since they're treated as text, the same rules apply. The key points are that the unique words match, order doesn't matter, and there are no discrepancies in the content. So the answer should be 1.
