gt_text: VERITAS
vlm_output: dip

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "VERITAS" and the OCR output is "dip". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "dip". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "VERITAS". The OCR output is "dip", which is a different word. But wait, the category definitions say that for category 1, all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Since "VERITAS" isn't in "dip", that's not matching. 

Next, category 2 is partially correct if at least one unique word matches. But here, the OCR output has "dip" which isn't in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "VERITAS" and the OCR output has "dip", which isn't a match. So no words match. 

Then category 3 is for no matches or unrelated. Since "dip" isn't related to "VERITAS" and there are no matching words, it should be category 3. Even if there were typos, but here it's completely different. So the answer is 3.
