gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UBS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to compare these two based on the given steps and categories.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. Then step 2 is the comparison. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we have to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "UBS", which is a single word. The OCR output is "10%", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "UBS" is all uppercase letters, and "10%" has numbers and a symbol. The problem says to compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("UBS"), the OCR output needs to have that word. However, "10%" is not related. 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output is entirely different. Also, the category definitions say category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output doesn't have "UBS", it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But here, there are no matches. So it would be category 3: incorrect. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
