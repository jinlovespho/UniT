gt_text: Saturday
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Saturday" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Saturday". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But wait, the ground truth is a single word, "Saturday". The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "Saturday". The OCR output has "100%", which is not related. There's no match here. So it's not category 1. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But there are no matching words. The OCR output doesn't have "Saturday" or any of its variations. Even if there were typos, like "saturaday", but here it's "100%", which is unrelated. 

Therefore, it's category 3: incorrect. The output is unrelated or empty. Since "100%" is not related to "Saturday" at all, no words match. So the answer should be 3.
