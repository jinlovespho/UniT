gt_text: AIA
vlm_output: AIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "AIA". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is just "AIA".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same, the order is the same here, but even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter. The unique words in the ground truth are just "AIA" (assuming that's a single word). The OCR output has the same word.

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned here, so the small typos still count as matches, but since there are none, that's not an issue.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "AIA") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect elements here. The answer should be category 1.
