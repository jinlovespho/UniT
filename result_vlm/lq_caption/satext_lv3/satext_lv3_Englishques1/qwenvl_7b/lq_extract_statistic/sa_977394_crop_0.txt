Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40" and the VLM OCR output is also "40". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "40".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same. Also, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "40". The OCR output has the same word. 

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same. There's no capitalization to worry about since it's a number. No punctuation or spaces either. The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it should be category 1. There's no case where any words are missing. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
