gt_text: Dunelm
vlm_output: Dunelm

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Dunelm" and the VLM OCR output is also "Dunelm". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Dunelm", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. The user mentioned that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both texts are the same word.

The comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Dunelm". The OCR output also has "Dunelm". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing, so no issues there. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both are the same word, all unique words (just one) are present. Therefore, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any partial matches or missing words. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. No need to consider Category 2 or 3 here. The answer should be 1.
