gt_text: Office
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Office" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth is the word "Office".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. But I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Office".

Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth appear in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The word "Office" isn't present here. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "100%" is not a typo of "Office". They are completely different. Also, the comparison is based on unique words from the ground truth. Since "Office" isn't in the OCR output, there's no match.

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 
2 if at least one but not all, 
3 if none match or the output is unrelated.

In this case, the OCR output has no words matching the ground truth. Therefore, it should be category 3.
