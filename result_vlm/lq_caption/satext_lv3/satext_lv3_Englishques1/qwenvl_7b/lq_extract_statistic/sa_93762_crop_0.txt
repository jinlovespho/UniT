gt_text: NORWEGIAN
vlm_output: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NORWEGIAN" and the VLM OCR output is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE". So the extracted text is just that phrase.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has only one unique word: "NORWEGIAN". The OCR output has two words: "NORWEGIAN" and "ESCAPE". 

Now, considering the unique words in the ground truth, which is just "NORWEGIAN". The OCR output includes "NORWEGIAN" exactly as in the ground truth. Even though there's an extra word "ESCAPE", the presence of "NORWEGIAN" in the OCR output means that all unique ground truth words are present. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has the correct word, even though there's an extra word. But since the category is based on the unique words in the ground truth, and all of them are present in the OCR output (even if there are extra words), this should be category 1. 

Wait, but the problem says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth's unique words are {"NORWEGIAN"}. The OCR output's words are {"NORWEGIAN", "ESCAPE"}. The set of ground truth words is a subset of the OCR output's words. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. So the answer should be category 1.
