gt_text: APL
vlm_output: APL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APL" and the VLM OCR output is also "APL". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "APL", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "APL", which is a single word. So the unique words are just "APL".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing.
- Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here because both are identical.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word "APL" and the OCR output has the same, this should be category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches exactly, so all conditions are met for category 1.
