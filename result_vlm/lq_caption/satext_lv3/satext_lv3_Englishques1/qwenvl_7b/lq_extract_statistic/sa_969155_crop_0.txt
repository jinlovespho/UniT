gt_text: OFFICE
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OFFICE" and the VLM OCR output is "POST OFFICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "POST OFFICE", which is straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has the word "OFFICE", and the OCR output has "POST" and "OFFICE". 

Now, the categories are based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has one unique word: "OFFICE". The OCR output includes "OFFICE" as well. Even though there's an extra word "POST", the key is that all unique words from the ground truth are present. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. Also, capitalization and spacing are ignored, so "OFFICE" in the OCR matches the ground truth. 

Since the OCR output contains the exact word "OFFICE", which is the only unique word in the ground truth, this should be category 1: Correct. The presence of an extra word doesn't matter because the requirement is that all ground truth words are present, not that the OCR output has only those words. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as partially correct or incorrect. The main word is there, so the answer should be 1.
