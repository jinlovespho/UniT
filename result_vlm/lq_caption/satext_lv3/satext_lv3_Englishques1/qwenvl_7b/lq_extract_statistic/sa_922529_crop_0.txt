gt_text: 060630
vlm_output: 060630

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "060630" and the VLM OCR output is also "060630". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are the same string, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, but "060630" is a single string, not multiple words. So maybe the unique words here are just that one string. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc. But in this case, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output is exactly the same, all unique words (which is just one) are present. So this should be category 1. There's no missing words or typos, so it's a full match.
