gt_text: BOTTEGA
vlm_output: BOTTEGA VENETA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BOTTEGA" and the VLM OCR output is "BOTTEGA VENETA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "BOTTEGA VENETA", which is two words: "BOTTEGA" and "VENETA".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "BOTTEGA", which is just one word. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "BOTTEGA", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, "BOTTEGA" is definitely there. The second word "VENETA" isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because the comparison is only about the unique words in the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the OCR had the words in a different order, it would still count. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are uppercase, so that's fine. There's no typo in "BOTTEGA" in the OCR output. 

Since all the unique words in the ground truth (which is just "BOTTEGA") are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. The presence of an extra word "VENETA" doesn't affect the category because the comparison is only about the ground truth words. Even if there were typos, as long as the words from the ground truth are there, it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
