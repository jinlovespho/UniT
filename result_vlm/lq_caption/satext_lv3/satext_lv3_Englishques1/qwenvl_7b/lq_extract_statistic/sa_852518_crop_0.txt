gt_text: TECHNOGYM
vlm_output: The image contains the following text:- "HOTEL"- "RESTAURANT"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, the ground truth text is "TECHNOGYM". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the following text:- "HOTEL"- "RESTAURANT"".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT". So the extracted text is those two words.

Step 2 involves comparing these extracted words with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "TECHNOGYM". The OCR output has "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT". 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word, "TECHNOGYM". The OCR output has "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT", neither of which is "TECHNOGYM". 

Even considering possible typos, "TECHNOGYM" isn't present. The OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "TECHNOGYM" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT", which are different. So there's no match. Therefore, category 3 applies.
