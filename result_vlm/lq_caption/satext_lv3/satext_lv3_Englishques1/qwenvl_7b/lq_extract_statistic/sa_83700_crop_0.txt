gt_text: COVENT
vlm_output: Wheels

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "COVENT" and the VLM OCR output is "Wheels". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "Wheels".

Step 2: Compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth is "COVENT", which is one word. The OCR output is "Wheels", which is another single word. 

Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "COVENT". The OCR output has "Wheels".

Next, check if they match considering case, spacing, typos. The OCR output is "Wheels" (capital W, lowercase else), and ground truth is "COVENT" (all caps). If we ignore capitalization, "Wheels" vs "covent" – they are different words. There's no overlap in the words. So "Wheels" doesn't contain "COVENT" even with case ignored. Also, there are no typos here because they are different words entirely. 

So according to the categories: category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "Wheels" and "COVENT" are completely different words, there's no match. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
