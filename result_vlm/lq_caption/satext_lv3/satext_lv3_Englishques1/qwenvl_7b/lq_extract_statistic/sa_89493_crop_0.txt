vlm_output: ICIdemande de permis de construireE.LeclercDRIVE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "demande" and the VLM OCR output is "ICIdemande de permis de construireE.LeclercDRIVE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output seems to have some extra characters and words, but the main part is "ICIdemande de permis de construireE.LeclercDRIVE". I'll consider the entire string as the extracted text, even though there might be some noise.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "demande". The OCR output includes "demande" in the middle, but there are other words like "permis", "construire", "E.Leclerc", "DRIVE", etc. However, the key point here is that the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "demande", and the OCR output includes "demande", even with some typos or surrounding text, the main word is present.

Now, checking the conditions: word order doesn't matter, so the position of "demande" in the OCR output isn't an issue. Capitalization is ignored, so "demande" in lowercase matches. Punctuation and extra spaces are also ignored. The OCR output has "demande" exactly as in the ground truth, so no typos here. 

Since the only unique word in the ground truth is present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present. Since "demande" is there, it's correct.
