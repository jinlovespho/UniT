gt_text: ADMINISTRATION
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ADMINISTRATION" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "ADMINISTRATION". 

Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth word is "ADMINISTRATION", which is a noun meaning the act of administering or managing something. 

Looking at the OCR output, "10%" doesn't contain the word "ADMINISTRATION" or any of its variations. Even if I consider typos, "10%" is a numerical value and doesn't resemble the word "administration" in any way. Also, ignoring capitalization and punctuation, "10%" is just "10" and a percent sign, which are not related to the ground truth word. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, the category should be 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth.
