Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since both are just the number 1.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "1". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but "1" is a number, so that's not applicable here. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored, but there's nothing else in the text. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there's no typo here since both are exactly "1".

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
