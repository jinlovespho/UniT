gt_text: PERFORMANCE
vlm_output: 2014

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PERFORMANCE" and the VLM OCR output is "2014". So I need to compare these two based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "PERFORMANCE".

Step 2 instructions: compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But the ground truth has only one unique word: "PERFORMANCE". The OCR output has "2014", which is numbers. Are numbers considered words here? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "PERFORMANCE", and the OCR output is numbers, there's no overlap. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but the OCR output here is just numbers. There's no typo in the OCR output that would match "PERFORMANCE" even with typos. For example, if the OCR had "perforamnce" or something similar, maybe. But "2014" is entirely different. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are {"PERFORMANCE"}, and the OCR output has {"2014"}. There's no match. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and not matching any words. So the answer should be 3.
