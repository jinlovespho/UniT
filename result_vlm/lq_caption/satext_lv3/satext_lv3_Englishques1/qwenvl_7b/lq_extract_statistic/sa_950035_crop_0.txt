Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "60" and the VLM OCR output is also "60". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "60".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly the same: "60" vs "60".

The ground truth has one unique word, which is "60". The OCR output also has "60". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no issue here. Even if there were a typo, like "6o" or "60 ", it would still count as a match because of the rules. But since they are exactly the same, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
