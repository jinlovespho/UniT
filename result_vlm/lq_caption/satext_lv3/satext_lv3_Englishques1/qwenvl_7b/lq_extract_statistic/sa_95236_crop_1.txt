gt_text: TADANO
vlm_output: TADANO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TADANO" and the VLM OCR output is also "TADANO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "TADANO", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TADANO". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. There's no typo mentioned here because both are identical. 

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since the OCR output matches exactly, even though the instructions mention typos are considered matches, but in this case, there are no typos. Therefore, it's a correct match. The answer should be 1.
