gt_text: ARCHIVO
vlm_output: 1978

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARCHIVO" and the VLM OCR output is "1978". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1978", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "ARCHIVO", which is Spanish for "file" or "archive".

Now, comparing them. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ARCHIVO". The OCR output is "1978", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since "1978" is a number and not a word, there's no match with "ARCHIVO". The OCR output doesn't contain the word "ARCHIVO" or any of its variations. Also, considering the rules about ignoring case, punctuation, etc., but "1978" is just digits, not a word. So there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3.
