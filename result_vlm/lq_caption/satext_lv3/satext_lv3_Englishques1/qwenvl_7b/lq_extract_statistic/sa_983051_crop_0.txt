gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "Nikon".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon". The OCR output also has "Nikon". So the unique words match perfectly.

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "Nikon", there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches. But there are no typos here because they are identical.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, this fits category 1. There's no case where part of the words match or none match. So the answer should be 1.
