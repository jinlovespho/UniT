Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "RESTAURACJA".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both texts are single words. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RESTAURACJA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
