gt_text: OYO
vlm_output: OYO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OYO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "OYO", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "OYO". The OCR output is exactly the same. Since the words are identical, even if there were typos, they would still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo. So all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "OYO") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a full match. So the answer should be 1.
