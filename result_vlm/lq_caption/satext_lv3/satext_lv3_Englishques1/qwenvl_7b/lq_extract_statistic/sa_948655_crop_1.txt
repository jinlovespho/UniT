gt_text: 2,2
vlm_output: no parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "2,2" and the VLM OCR output is "no parking". So the first step is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "no parking".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has "2,2". Let's break down the steps as per the instructions.

The categories are based on whether the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth here is "2,2". The unique words would be "2" and maybe the comma? But the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the ground truth is a number with a comma. But the OCR output is "no parking".

So the unique words in the ground truth are "2" and maybe the comma? But the problem says to ignore punctuation. So the comma is ignored. So the unique words are just "2".

The OCR output has "no" and "parking" as words. Neither of those are "2". So there's no match. Therefore, according to category 3, which is incorrect: no words match, or the output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
