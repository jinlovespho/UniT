gt_text: GardenCafe
vlm_output: London Eye

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GardenCafe" and the VLM OCR output is "London Eye". I need to follow the steps given.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's "London Eye".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth is "GardenCafe". The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is one word: "GardenCafe". So the set of unique words is just {"GardenCafe"}.

Now, compare the OCR output's words. The OCR output is "London Eye", which splits into "London" and "Eye". So the unique words here are {"London", "Eye"}.

Now, check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. The ground truth has "GardenCafe". The OCR words are "London" and "Eye". Are there any matches? Let's see. If we ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and typos, but the ground truth is "GardenCafe" and the OCR has "London" and "Eye". None of these words are similar enough. "GardenCafe" isn't present, and there's no partial matches. Even if there were typos, like "GardenCafe" vs "GardenCafe" with some letters changed, but here the OCR words are completely different. So no matches.

So according to the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
