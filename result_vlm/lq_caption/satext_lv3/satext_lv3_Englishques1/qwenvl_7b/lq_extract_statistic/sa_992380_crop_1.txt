gt_text: FLiXBUS

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "FLiXBUS" and the VLM OCR output is "FLIXBUS". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "FLIXBUS".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "FLiXBUS". So the unique words here are just that one word.

Now, the OCR output is "FLIXBUS". Let's check if they match considering the rules. The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The ground truth has "FLiXBUS" with a lowercase 'i' and the OCR has "FLIXBUS" with uppercase 'I'? Wait, no, actually, the ground truth is "FLiXBUS"—so the 'i' is lowercase? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact characters. Let me look again.

Original ground truth: "FLiXBUS" — so the letters are F, L, i, X, B, U, S. The OCR output is "FLIXBUS" — F, L, I, X, B, U, S. So the difference is the 'i' vs 'I' in the third character. The instructions say to ignore capitalization, so that's considered a match. Also, small typos still count as matches. So even if there's a typo, like a lowercase vs uppercase letter, it's still considered a match.

So the OCR output has "FLIXBUS" which is the same as the ground truth except for the case of the 'i'. Since capitalization is ignored, they are considered the same. Therefore, the unique word from the ground truth ("FLiXBUS") is present in the OCR output as "FLIXBUS" when case is ignored. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. So according to category 1: Correct. 

I don't see any other words here. The ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output has that same word with a typo in capitalization, which is ignored. So it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
