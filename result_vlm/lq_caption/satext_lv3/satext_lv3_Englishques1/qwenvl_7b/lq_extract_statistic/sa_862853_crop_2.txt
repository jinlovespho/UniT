gt_text: JAGUAR
vlm_output: JAGUAR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "JAGUAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "JAGUAR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "JAGUAR".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "JAGUAR". The OCR output also has "JAGUAR". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. So that's a match. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output", this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
