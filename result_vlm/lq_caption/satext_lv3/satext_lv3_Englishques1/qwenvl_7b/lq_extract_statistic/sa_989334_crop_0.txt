gt_text: M
vlm_output: M

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "M" and the VLM OCR output is also "M". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "M", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both are just "M", so order isn't an issue here.

The comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "M". The OCR output also has "M". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are just "M", there's no issue here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "M" which matches the ground truth's "M", this should be Category 1. 

There's no possibility of Category 2 or 3 here because there's only one word, and it's a perfect match. Even if there were typos, like "m" vs "M", it would still count as a match due to the instruction to ignore capitalization. But in this case, the capitalization is the same. 

So the answer should be 1.
