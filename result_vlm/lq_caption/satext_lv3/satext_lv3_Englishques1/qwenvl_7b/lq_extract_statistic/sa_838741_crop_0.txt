Okay, let's see here. The ground truth is "INTERNATIONAL" and the OCR output is "100". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's just "100".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The rules say word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. But we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is one word: "INTERNATIONAL". The OCR output is "100", which is a number. 

Now, the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word. The OCR output has "100", which is a number, not a word. But the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100" is a numeral, not a word. The question is whether "100" can be considered a match for "INTERNATIONAL" under any of the rules.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 otherwise. Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth (assuming that "100" isn't a typo or alternative spelling of "INTERNATIONAL"), it's not matching. The OCR output is a number, not a word. So there are no matches. Therefore, it should be category 3.
