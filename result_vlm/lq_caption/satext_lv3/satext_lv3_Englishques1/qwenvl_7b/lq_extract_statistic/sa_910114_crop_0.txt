gt_text: PAULANER
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to read any text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PAULANER," and the VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to read any text." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence: "The image is too blurry to read any text." So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PAULANER." The OCR output has multiple words, but none of them are "PAULANER" or any variation that could be considered a match. 

The comparison rules state that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "PAULANER," and the OCR output doesn't have that word, even considering typos, case, spacing, etc., there's no match. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words match, 
2 if at least one but not all, 
3 if none match or the output is wrong/unrelated. 

In this case, the OCR output doesn't contain the word "PAULANER" and instead provides a reason why the text can't be read. This is unrelated to the ground truth, so it falls under category 3.
