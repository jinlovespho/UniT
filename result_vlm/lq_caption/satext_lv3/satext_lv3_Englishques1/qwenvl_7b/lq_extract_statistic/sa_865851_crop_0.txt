gt_text: SALVADOR
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "SALVADOR" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules. The key points are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "SALVADOR", which is a single word. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, considering the rules, the unique words in the ground truth are just "SALVADOR". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number. Since "100%" doesn't contain the word "SALVADOR" or any variation of it (ignoring case, typos, etc.), there's no match. 

The categories are:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output.
2 — Partially correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: no matches or unrelated.

Since there's no overlap between "SALVADOR" and "100%", the category should be 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain the ground truth word. Even if we consider typos, "100%" isn't a typo of "SALVADOR". So the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 70
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 159
