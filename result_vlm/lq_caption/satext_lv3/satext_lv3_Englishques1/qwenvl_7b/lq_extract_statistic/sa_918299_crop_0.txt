gt_text: S32
vlm_output: Airport

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "S32" and the VLM OCR output is "Airport". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "Airport".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has "S32", which is a single word. The OCR output is "Airport", which is a different word. 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. Since "S32" is not present in "Airport", this isn't met.
- Category 2 is for partial matches, but since there are no overlapping words between "S32" and "Airport", even partially, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated outputs. Since "Airport" doesn't contain "S32" and they are unrelated, this fits.

So the answer should be category 3.
