gt_text: HOTEL
vlm_output: HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "HOTEL" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "HOTEL".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are exactly the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOTEL". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique ground truth words are present. 

We also need to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. There's no punctuation or extra spaces here. The words are exactly the same, so typos aren't a factor here. 

Since all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
