gt_text: SWITCH
vlm_output: NINTENDO SWITCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "SWITCH" and the VLM OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NINTENDO SWITCH". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering the given conditions.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one unique word: "SWITCH". The OCR output has two words: "NINTENDO" and "SWITCH". 

Next, I need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "SWITCH", which is exactly present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "NINTENDO", isn't part of the ground truth, but the rules say we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, since "SWITCH" is present, even though there's an extra word, it's still a match.

Also, considering that capitalization and spacing are ignored, but here both are in uppercase and the spacing is correct. There are no typos in "SWITCH" in the OCR output. 

So, all the unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, this should be category 1.
