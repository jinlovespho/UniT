Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "95" and the VLM OCR output is also "95". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "95".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same. 

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "95". The OCR output also has "95", so they match exactly. 

The other considerations are about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Since both are just numbers with no punctuation or spaces, those factors don't come into play here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "95" is the only word and it's present in the OCR output, this fits Category 1. 

No issues here, so the answer should be 1.
