gt_text: LAMBORGHINI
vlm_output: LAMBORGHINI

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LAMBORGHINI" and the VLM OCR output is also "LAMBORGHINI". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "LAMBORGHINI". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos because they're identical. 

So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this should be a perfect match. There's no missing words or extra words. The output is exactly correct. So the category should be 1.
