gt_text: Microsoft
vlm_output: Microsoft

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Microsoft" and the VLM OCR output is also "Microsoft". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Microsoft".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Microsoft".

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Both are the same here, same word, same case. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So, since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (just "Microsoft"), it should be category 1. There's no missing words, and all are present. Even if there were typos, like "Micosoft", it's still considered a match. But here, it's exact. So the answer is 1.
