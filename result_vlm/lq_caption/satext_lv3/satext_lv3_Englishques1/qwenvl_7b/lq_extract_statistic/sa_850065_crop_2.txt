gt_text: maje

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "maje" and the VLM OCR output is also "maje". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "maje".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "maje". The OCR output also has "maje". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "maje") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be correct. There's no partial match or no matches. The answer should be 1.
