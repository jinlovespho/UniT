Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is also "105". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to go through the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "105", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "105".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "105". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "105" since it's a single number. The OCR output is also "105", so the unique words are the same. 

Now, considering the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are exactly "105", the unique words match perfectly. There's no issue with order, case, spacing, or typos here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Category 2 is for when at least one but not all unique words match. But in this case, all unique words (just one) do match. So Category 2 doesn't apply. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong. That's not the case here. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 1. The OCR output is exactly correct, so all unique words from the ground truth are present without any issues.
