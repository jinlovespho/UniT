gt_text: ZAVOS
vlm_output: ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZAVOS" and the VLM OCR output is "ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "ZAVOSMONASTIRAKICENTER". There's no punctuation, just a single string of letters. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ZAVOS", which is a single word. The OCR output has "ZAVOS" as the beginning part of the string, followed by "MONASTIRAKICENTER". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look for the presence of the ground truth words in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "ZAVOS", I need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the OCR output, "ZAVOS" is indeed the first part of the string. The rest is "MONASTIRAKICENTER", which are additional words not in the ground truth. But since the ground truth only has "ZAVOS", and the OCR output includes that exact word (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), then all unique ground truth words are present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if some are present, 3 if none. Since "ZAVOS" is present in the OCR output, even though there are extra words, the category should be 1. 

I should also check if there are any typos. The OCR output starts with "ZAVOS" exactly as in the ground truth, so no typos here. The rest of the OCR output is extra but doesn't affect the presence of the ground truth word. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
