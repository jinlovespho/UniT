gt_text: ARTIGAS
vlm_output: JUAN DE GARAY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ARTIGAS" and the VLM OCR output is "JUAN DE GARAY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "JUAN DE GARAY". Now, the ground truth is "ARTIGAS". 

Next, I have to compare these two texts based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. I should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is a single word: "ARTIGAS". The OCR output has three words: "JUAN", "DE", and "GARAY".

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has "ARTIGAS", and the OCR output has "JUAN", "DE", "GARAY". None of these words in the OCR output match "ARTIGAS" exactly, even when ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Let me check for possible typos. "GARAY" is close to "ARTIGAS"? No, they are different. "JUAN" and "DE" are not related. So there's no match for the ground truth word "ARTIGAS" in the OCR output.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are no matches here, it falls under category 3.
