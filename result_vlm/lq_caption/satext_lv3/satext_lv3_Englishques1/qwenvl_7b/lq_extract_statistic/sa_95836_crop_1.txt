gt_text: ROVER
vlm_output: ROVER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROVER" and the VLM OCR output is also "ROVER". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are "ROVER".

Next, comparing them with the specified conditions. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ROVER". The OCR output also has "ROVER".

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. There's no missing words, and everything matches. Even if there were typos, like "Rover" with a lowercase 'o', it would still count as a match. But here, it's exactly the same. So definitely category 1.
