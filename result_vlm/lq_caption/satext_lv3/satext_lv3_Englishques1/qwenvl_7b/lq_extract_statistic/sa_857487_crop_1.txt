gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the numbers and a percentage sign. Then step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "MUSEUM".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. But the OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. The ground truth is a single word. Now, the categories are based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MUSEUM". The OCR output has "10%", which is not a word related to "MUSEUM". 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "10%" is a number and a symbol, not a word. Also, small typos still count as matches, but here the OCR output isn't even a typo of "MUSEUM". It's completely different. 

So, since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique words, it should be category 3. Because category 1 requires all unique words to be present, which isn't the case here. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match, but there's no match here. So category 3 is incorrect.
