gt_text: Gategourmet
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Gategourmet" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the number 10 followed by a percentage sign. 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. But I need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth. "Gategourmet" is a single word. If I split it into possible parts, maybe "Gate" and "gourmet"? Wait, but the original is one word. However, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "Gategourmet", does that count as one word or two? The instruction isn't clear on whether to split compound words. But the example given in the problem might help. Let me check the categories again.

The categories are based on unique words from the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "Gategourmet", the unique words would be {"Gategourmet"}, right? Unless it's considered as two words, but there's no space. So I think it's one word. 

Now, the OCR output is "10%". The words here would be "10%" which is a single token. But the ground truth's unique word is "Gategourmet". Comparing them, there's no overlap. The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol, not related to "Gategourmet". 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output is completely different. Also, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "10%" has a percentage sign, which is punctuation, but even if we remove that, it's just "10", which still doesn't match "Gategourmet". 

So according to the categories: if none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output has no words that match "Gategourmet". Therefore, the answer should be 3.
