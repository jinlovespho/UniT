Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "ALEXELA" and a VLM OCR output that's also "ALEXELA". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "ALEXELA", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the ground truth.

Moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth is "ALEXELA". Let's break it down. The ground truth is a single word, "ALEXELA". The OCR output is the same exact string. Now, considering the comparison rules. Since the OCR output is identical to the ground truth, even if there were minor differences, like a typo, but in this case, there are none. 

The category definitions say that Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "ALEXELA", and the OCR output has that same word, it meets the criteria for Category 1. 

I should check if there's any reason to think it might not be Category 1. For example, if the OCR output had a typo, but here it's exact. Also, since word order doesn't matter, but in this case, there's only one word, so order isn't an issue. There's no punctuation or spacing issues here either. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 1.
