gt_text: CENTRAL
vlm_output: OLYMPIC PARK

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CENTRAL" and the VLM OCR output is "OLYMPIC PARK". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the output is "OLYMPIC PARK".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "CENTRAL". The OCR output has "OLYMPIC" and "PARK". 

Now, the rules say that word order doesn't matter. So I need to check if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words, considering case, spacing, etc., and ignoring those. Also, small typos are still considered matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "CENTRAL". The OCR output has two words: "OLYMPIC" and "PARK". Neither of these words is "CENTRAL" or a close enough typo. For example, "OLYMPIC" is a different word entirely, and "PARK" is also different. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
