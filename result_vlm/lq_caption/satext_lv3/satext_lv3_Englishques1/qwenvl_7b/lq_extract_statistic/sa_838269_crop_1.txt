Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output is the same word. So when we compare, ignoring case, there's no difference. Also, since the OCR output has exactly the same word, even if there were a typo, but in this case, there isn't. So all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "Google") are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's matched, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. So the answer should be 1.
