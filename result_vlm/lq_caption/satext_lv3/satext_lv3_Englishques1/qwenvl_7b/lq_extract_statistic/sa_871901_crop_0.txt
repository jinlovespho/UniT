gt_text: sponsored
vlm_output: Amsterdam

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "sponsored" and the VLM OCR output is "Amsterdam". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Amsterdam", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is just "Amsterdam".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "sponsored". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word, "sponsored", the unique words are just that one.

Now, the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output is "Amsterdam" and the ground truth is "sponsored". Let's check if there's any overlap. The words are different: "Amsterdam" vs "sponsored". No letters in common? Wait, "sponsored" has 's', 'p', 'o', 'n', 's', 'o', 'r', 'e', 'd'. "Amsterdam" has 'A', 'm', 'a', 's', 't', 'e', 'r', 'd', 'a', 'm'. So there's some letters in common, like 's', 't', 'e', 'r', 'd', but the words themselves are different. 

The rules say small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output isn't a typo of the ground truth. It's a completely different word. So there's no matching word here. The ground truth has "sponsored" and the OCR output has "Amsterdam". Since there's no overlap in the words (even considering typos), then according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "sponsored". The OCR output has "Amsterdam", which is a different word. So there's no match. Therefore, category 3 is incorrect. So the answer should be 3.
