gt_text: GRAND
vlm_output: GRAND

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GRAND" and the VLM OCR output is also "GRAND". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is straightforward since the output is exactly "GRAND". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "GRAND" (since it's a single word). The OCR output also has "GRAND". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But since both are exactly the same in terms of letters and case, there's no issue here. Also, there are no typos mentioned, so "GRAND" matches perfectly.

Since all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "GRAND") are present in the OCR output, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. So the category is 1.
