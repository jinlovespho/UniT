gt_text: Canon
vlm_output: Canon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Canon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Canon". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Canon".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word. 

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Canon". The OCR output also has "Canon". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned, so small typos would still count as matches, but there are none here.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
