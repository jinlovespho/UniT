Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "HSBC".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC". The OCR output also has "HSBC". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're exactly the same.

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since both are the same, it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
