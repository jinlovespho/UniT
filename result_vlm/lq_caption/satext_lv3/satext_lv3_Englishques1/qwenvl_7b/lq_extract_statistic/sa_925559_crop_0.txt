gt_text: SPIETH
vlm_output: SPIETH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPIETH" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPIETH". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "SPIETH", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words. So order isn't an issue here. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SPIETH". The OCR output also has "SPIETH". So the sets are identical. 

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's a match. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both have the same single word, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output is exactly correct. So the answer should be 1.
