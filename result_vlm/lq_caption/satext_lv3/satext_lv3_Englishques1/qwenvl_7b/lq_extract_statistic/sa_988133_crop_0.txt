gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: UIT

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "UIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "UIT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "UIT", so that's straightforward. Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "UIT". The OCR output also has "UIT". So the unique words match exactly. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here because both are identical.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
