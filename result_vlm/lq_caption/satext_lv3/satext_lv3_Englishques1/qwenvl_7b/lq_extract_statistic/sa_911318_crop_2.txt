gt_text: ALTIS
vlm_output: 2017

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ALTIS" and the VLM OCR output is "2017". The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2017", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is "ALTIS", which is a word, presumably a proper noun like a name or a brand.

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ALTIS". The OCR output is "2017", which is a number, not a word. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "ALTIS" is a word, and "2017" is a number. Since there's no overlap in the words (the OCR output doesn't contain the word "ALTIS" or any variation of it), even considering typos, "2017" doesn't resemble "ALTIS" in any way. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, output is unrelated, or empty.

In this case, the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth's unique word "ALTIS". The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated to the word "ALTIS". Therefore, according to category 3, it's incorrect.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 148
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 341
