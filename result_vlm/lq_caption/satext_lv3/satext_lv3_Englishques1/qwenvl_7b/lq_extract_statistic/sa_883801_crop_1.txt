gt_text: MIRA
vlm_output: MIRA

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "MIRA" and the VLM OCR output is also "MIRA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "MIRA".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "MIRA". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. Since all unique words match, even though there's only one word, it's still a full match. There's no partial or incorrect here. So the answer should be 1.
