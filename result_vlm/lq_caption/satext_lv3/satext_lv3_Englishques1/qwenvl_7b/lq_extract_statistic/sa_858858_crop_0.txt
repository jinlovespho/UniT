gt_text: DOUBLETREE
vlm_output: 2013

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "DOUBLETREE" and the OCR output is "2013". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "2013", which is a number. The ground truth is "DOUBLETREE", which is a word. 

Now, Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But wait, the OCR output is "2013", which is a number, and the ground truth is "DOUBLETREE", which is a word. So, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The instructions mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DOUBLETREE". The OCR output is "2013", which is a number, not a word. So there's no match here. 

Also, the categories say that Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong. Since "2013" isn't a word that can be considered a match for "DOUBLETREE" even with typos, and there's no overlap in the words, the answer should be Category 3.
