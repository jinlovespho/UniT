gt_text: ELEVEN
vlm_output: 7-ELEVEN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ELEVEN" and the VLM OCR output is "7-ELEVEN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "7-ELEVEN". So, the text content would be "7-ELEVEN".

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, following the given guidelines. The ground truth is "ELEVEN", which is a single word. The OCR output has "7-ELEVEN". 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "ELEVEN". The OCR output has two parts: "7" and "ELEVEN". However, the hyphen might be considered as punctuation, which we are supposed to ignore. Also, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. So, if I remove the hyphen and the "7", does that leave "ELEVEN" in the OCR output?

Wait, the OCR output is "7-ELEVEN". If we ignore punctuation (the hyphen), then the text is "7ELEVEN". But the ground truth is "ELEVEN". The "7" is a digit, not part of the word. However, the problem states that we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ELEVEN", and the OCR output includes "ELEVEN" as part of "7-ELEVEN". 

But the instruction says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So, the hyphen is punctuation and should be ignored. Also, the "7" is a digit. However, the ground truth is only the word "ELEVEN". So, does the OCR output contain "ELEVEN" as a substring? But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output has "ELEVEN" as part of "7-ELEVEN", but not as a standalone word, does that count?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The ground truth is the exact text "ELEVEN", which is a single word. The OCR output is "7-ELEVEN". So, the OCR output includes the word "ELEVEN" but with a prefix "7-". But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces and punctuation. So, if we remove the hyphen and the "7", then the OCR output would have "ELEVEN", which matches the ground truth. However, the "7" is a digit, not a letter. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "ELEVEN", and the OCR output has "ELEVEN" as a substring. But does that count as a match?

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as a set of words. If we split "7-ELEVEN" into words, considering hyphens as word separators, then "7" and "ELEVEN" are separate words. But the ground truth is "ELEVEN". So, the OCR output contains "ELEVEN" as a word. The "7" is a separate word, but since the ground truth doesn't have that, it's irrelevant. Therefore, the OCR output includes the word "ELEVEN", which is in the ground truth. 

But the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "ELEVEN", and the OCR output has "ELEVEN" as a word. So, that would be a correct match. Therefore, the category would be 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the OCR output has "7-ELEVEN" which includes "ELEVEN" as part of the text. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. In this case, the OCR output is not a typo but has an extra "7-". But the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. However, the "7-" is not a space. But the instruction says to ignore punctuation. The hyphen is punctuation, so removing it, we have "7ELEVEN". But the "7" is a digit. The ground truth is "ELEVEN", which is letters only. However, the instruction says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. It doesn't mention numbers. So, does the presence of the "7" affect the comparison?

This is a bit ambiguous. If we strictly follow the instructions, we should compare the words. If the OCR output contains "ELEVEN" as a word (ignoring the "7-"), then it's correct. However, if the "7" is considered part of the word, then it's a typo. But the problem says small typos still count as matches. So, if "7ELEVEN" is considered a typo of "ELEVEN", then it's still a match. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "7-ELEVEN", which includes "ELEVEN" as a substring. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "ELEVEN" as a word. The OCR output includes "ELEVEN" as a word (assuming that hyphens are word separators, so "7" and "ELEVEN" are separate words). Therefore, the OCR output contains the required word "ELEVEN", so it's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
