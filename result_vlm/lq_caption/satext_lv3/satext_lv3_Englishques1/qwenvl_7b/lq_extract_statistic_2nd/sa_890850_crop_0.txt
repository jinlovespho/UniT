gt_text: OUTBACK SUPER-LITE
vlm_output: OUTBACK

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE" and the OCR output is "OUTBACK". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "OUTBACK". Then compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". The OCR output has "OUTBACK" but is missing "SUPER-LITE". 

The categories are based on whether all unique words from the ground truth are present. Since the OCR output only has one of the two words, that would be category 2, which is partially correct. Even though there's a typo allowed, but there's no typo here. The OCR missed a word. So the answer should be 2.
