gt_text: LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY
vlm_output: LIBRARYGALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY". So the unique words here are "LEEDS", "LIBRARY", and "GALLERY". The OCR output is "LIBRARYGALLERY". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "LIBRARYGALLERY". Then, compare it with the ground truth's unique words, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos.

Breaking down the OCR output: "LIBRARYGALLERY" seems to be a combination of "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY" without a space. So the words here are "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY". The ground truth has "LEEDS" as another unique word. 

So the OCR output has two of the three unique words from the ground truth. The missing one is "LEEDS". The other two, "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY", are present. Since the category is based on whether all unique words are present, but here only two out of three match. But wait, the instructions say that for category 1, all unique ground truth words must be present. Here, "LEEDS" is missing. So the OCR output doesn't have "LEEDS", so it's not category 1. 

But category 2 is when at least one but not all match. Wait, the ground truth has three unique words. The OCR has two. So that's at least one (actually two) but not all. So that would be category 2. However, maybe the problem is that the OCR output is "LIBRARYGALLERY" which is two words, but the ground truth has three. But the unique words in ground truth are three. The OCR output's unique words are two. So the count is two matches (LIBRARY and GALLERY) but missing LEEDS. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2.

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are LEEDS, LIBRARY, GALLERY. The OCR output has LIBRARY and GALLERY. So two out of three. So that's at least one (actually two) but not all. Therefore, category 2. 

But wait, the user's instruction says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the OCR output must have all of those words. Since it's missing LEEDS, it's not category 1. So category 2. So the answer is 2.
