<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "PAVIL JONKI" and the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR, which is straightforward here—it's "PAVILJONKI".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has two words: "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is one word: "PAVILJONKI".

Wait, but maybe I should split the OCR output into words? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI"—which seems like a combination of the two words. But since there's no space, is it considered as one word or two?

Hmm, the instructions mention ignoring extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is missing a space between "PAVIL" and "JONKI", making it one word. But the ground truth has two words. However, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has "PAVILJONKI" which is a single word. But the ground truth has "PAVIL" and "JONKI". 

Wait, but the OCR output might have a typo where "PAVILJONKI" is actually combining "PAVIL" and "JONKI" into one word. If we ignore spaces, maybe the OCR output is trying to capture both words but merged. However, the ground truth's unique words are "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output has "PAVILJONKI"—if we split it into parts, maybe "PAVIL" and "JONKI" are present as substrings. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth, but in any order and with possible typos.

But the OCR output is one word. The ground truth has two words. So does that mean the OCR output is missing a word? But maybe "PAVILJONKI" is a typo where "PAVIL" and "JONKI" are combined. However, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. So if the OCR output has "PAVILJONKI", which is "PAVIL" + "JONKI" with a 'J' instead of a space, does that count as containing both words?

Wait, but the OCR output is a single word. The ground truth has two words. So if we split the OCR output into words, it's just one. But the ground truth has two. So maybe the OCR output is missing one of the words. However, the OCR output might have a typo where "PAVILJONKI" is a merged form. But according to the rules, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output has "PAVILJONKI"—if we split it into words (assuming the OCR missed a space), does that count as containing both "PAVIL" and "JONKI"? 

But the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", which is the same as "PAVIL JONKI" but without the space, then it's considered as having both words. Because the space is ignored. So in that case, "PAVILJONKI" would be considered as "PAVIL" and "JONKI" with the space missing, but since we ignore spacing, it's still a match. 

Additionally, the OCR output has "PAVILJONKI" which has a 'J' instead of a space. But the ground truth is "PAVIL JONKI". So "PAVILJONKI" is a typo where the space is replaced with a 'J'? Wait, no. Wait, "PAVIL JONKI" is two words. The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI"—so maybe "PAVIL" + "JONKI" with the 'J' in the middle. Wait, that's not right. Let me check the letters. "PAVIL JONKI" is "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI"—so "PAVILJONKI" is "PAVIL" + "JONKI" but merged. Wait, "PAVIL" is P-A-V-I-L, then "JONKI" is J-O-N-K-I. So the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI"—so the 'J' is after 'L', which would be P-A-V-I-L-J-O-N-K-I. That's not the same as "PAVIL JONKI", but maybe it's a typo where the space is missing, but also the 'J' is in the wrong place? Wait, maybe the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI" which is "PAVIL" + "JONKI" with the 'J' instead of a space. But that would be "PAVIL" followed by "JONKI" with a 'J' in place of the space. But that's not a typo in the words themselves, but rather a missing space. 

But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is missing a space between "PAVIL" and "JONKI", making it one word, then it's considered as containing both words. However, the OCR output here is "PAVILJONKI", which is "PAVIL" followed by "JONKI" but with the 'J' in the middle. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, "PAVIL" is P-A-V-I-L. Then "JONKI" is J-O-N-K-I. If you combine them with a space, it's "PAVIL JONKI". If the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", that would be P-A-V-I-L-J-O-N-K-I. So the 'J' is right after the 'L', making it "PAVILJONKI". That's not the same as "PAVIL JONKI", but maybe it's a typo where the space is replaced with a 'J'? That seems like a bigger typo. However, the instructions say small typos still count as matches. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI" which is "PAVIL" + "JONKI" with the 'J' being an extra character. But that would be adding a 'J' instead of a space. Hmm. This is confusing. 

Wait, the ground truth is "PAVIL JONKI" (two words). The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI" (one word). If we ignore spaces, then "PAVILJONKI" would be considered as "PAVIL" and "JONKI" if we split it into parts. But how? Because "PAVILJONKI" is a single word. Unless the OCR output is actually "PAVIL JONKI" but the space is missing, making it "PAVILJONKI". But that would be a typo where the space is missing. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So if the OCR output is missing the space, then the words are still considered present. So in that case, "PAVILJONKI" would be considered as containing both "PAVIL" and "JONKI", even though they are merged into one word. 

But the problem states that we compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output has "PAVILJONKI" which, if we split into words by ignoring spaces, would be "PAVIL" and "JONKI". But the OCR output is a single word. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So even if the OCR output is a single word, if it's missing the space, it's considered as containing both words. 

Therefore, in this case, the OCR output would be considered to contain both "PAVIL" and "JONKI" (since the space is ignored), even though they are merged into one word. So the answer would be category 1, correct. 

But wait, is "PAVILJONKI" actually containing both words? If you split the OCR output into words by splitting on any possible space (which is missing), but the OCR output is one word. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So the presence of both words in the OCR output is considered even if they are merged. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI" which is a single word that's a combination of "PAVIL" and "JONKI" but with a typo. However, the problem says that small typos still count as matches. So if "PAVILJONKI" is a typo where the space is replaced with a 'J', but the words are still present, then it's a correct match. 

But I think the key here is that the OCR output has both words from the ground truth, just merged into one word with the space missing. Since we're ignoring spaces, that's considered a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
