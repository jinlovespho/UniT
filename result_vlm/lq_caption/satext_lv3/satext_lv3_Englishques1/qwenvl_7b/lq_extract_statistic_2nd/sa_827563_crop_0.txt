gt_text: 3 4

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "3 4", and the VLM OCR output is "SUNSCREEN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SUNSCREEN", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two numbers: "3" and "4". The OCR output is a single word "SUNSCREEN". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but the unique words in the ground truth are "3" and "4". The OCR output has only one word, "SUNSCREEN". Now, I need to check if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words, considering possible typos, case, and spacing. 

But wait, the ground truth words are numbers, and the OCR output is a word. There's no overlap here. The word "SUNSCREEN" doesn't contain "3" or "4" in any form. Even if we consider typos, like maybe "SUNSCREEN" could be a typo for "3 4", but that seems a stretch. The OCR output is entirely unrelated to the ground truth words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are no matches here, the answer should be category 3.
