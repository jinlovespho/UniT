Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "24" and the VLM OCR output is also "24". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "24".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "24". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about. The spacing is also the same. There are no typos mentioned, so "24" matches exactly.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, it should be category 1. There's no partial match here. So the answer is 1.
