gt_text: Office
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Office" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%".

Next step is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we have to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Office". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign.

Now, the comparison needs to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "Office" isn't in "100%". There's no overlap in words. Also, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but even with that, "100%" doesn't contain "Office" or any variation of it. The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated to the word "Office".

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The output is largely wrong and unrelated. Even if there were a typo, like "offce" instead of "Office", but here it's completely different. So the answer should be 3.
