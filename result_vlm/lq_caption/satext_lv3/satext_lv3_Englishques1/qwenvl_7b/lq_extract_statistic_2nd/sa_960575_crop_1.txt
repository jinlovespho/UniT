gt_text: GRAND
vlm_output: GRAND

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GRAND" and the VLM OCR output is also "GRAND". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "GRAND", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "GRAND".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in this aspect.
- Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here since both are the same.

Now, looking at the categories:
1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "GRAND" which is the same as the ground truth, this meets the criteria for category 1.

There's no mention of any missing words or typos. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
