gt_text: 936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO
vlm_output: PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO" and the VLM OCR output is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and categorize the result as 1, 2, or 3.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PONTE DE SANTO DOMINGOS". Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth, considering the given conditions.

The ground truth has the words: 936, ATELIER, 264, 375, ESCRITORIO. Wait, but numbers are part of the text here. The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the OCR output has words like PONTE, DE, SANTO, DOMINGOS. None of these words are present in the ground truth. The numbers in the ground truth are 936, 264, 375. The OCR output has no numbers. The words ATELIER and ESCRITORIO are in the ground truth, but the OCR output has PONTE, DE, SANTO, DOMINGOS. None of these match the words in the ground truth. 

The criteria say that word order doesn't matter, but the unique words in the ground truth are the ones that need to be matched. Since none of the words from the ground truth (like ATELIER, ESCRITORIO, the numbers) are present in the OCR output, even considering typos or case, there's no overlap. The OCR output is entirely different words. 

Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated, this would fall under category 3.
