gt_text: Long
vlm_output: Long

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Long" and the VLM OCR output is also "Long". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Long".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Long". The OCR output has "Long" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
