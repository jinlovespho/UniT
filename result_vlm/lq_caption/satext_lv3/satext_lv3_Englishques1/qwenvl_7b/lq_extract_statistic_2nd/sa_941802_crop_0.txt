gt_text: CHUNCHEON TOURIST GIDE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHUNCHEON TOURIST GIDE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a number, not any words related to the ground truth.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CHUNCHEON" and "TOURIST GIDE" (though "GIDE" might be a typo for "GUIDE"). However, the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain any of those words. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR (ignoring case, spacing, typos), 
2 if at least one matches but not all, 
3 if none match or the output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage, it's unrelated to the words in the ground truth. There's no overlap in words. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble any of the words. So, according to category 3, this would be incorrect because there are no matches and the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
