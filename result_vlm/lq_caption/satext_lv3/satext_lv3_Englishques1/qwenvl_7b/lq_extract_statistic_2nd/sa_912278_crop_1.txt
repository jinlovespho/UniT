gt_text: Treasures Hidden
vlm_output: 1000

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Treasures Hidden" and the VLM OCR output is "1000". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1000", which is a number. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which are the words "Treasures" and "Hidden".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Treasures" and "Hidden". The OCR output is "1000", which is a number, not a word. 

Next, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and typos. But "1000" doesn't have any letters, so it's not matching any words. The category definitions state that if no words match, it's category 3. Since the OCR output has no words that are in the ground truth, even after considering all the rules, it's definitely category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 122
2. Slightly Correct Num: 57
3. Incorrect Num: 317
