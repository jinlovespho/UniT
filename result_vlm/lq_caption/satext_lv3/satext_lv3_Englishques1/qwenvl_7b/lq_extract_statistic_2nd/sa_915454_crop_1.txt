gt_text: STUDIOS
vlm_output: STUDIOS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STUDIOS" and the VLM OCR output is also "STUDIOS". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "STUDIOS". The OCR output also has "STUDIOS". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. There are no typos because the OCR output matches exactly. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. Everything matches perfectly.
