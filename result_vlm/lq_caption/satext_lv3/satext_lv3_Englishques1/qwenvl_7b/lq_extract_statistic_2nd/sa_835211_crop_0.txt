gt_text: SWITCH NINTENDO
vlm_output: NINTENDO SWITCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "SWITCH NINTENDO" and the OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". The user wants me to check if they match based on certain criteria.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NINTENDO SWITCH". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that's okay.

Next, check the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SWITCH" and "NINTENDO". The OCR output has the same two words, just in reverse order. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, so even if they were lowercase, it would still count. There are no typos here, just the order is different. 

Since both words are present in the OCR output, even though the order is swapped, the category should be 1 — Correct. Because all unique words from the ground truth are present, regardless of order, case, spacing, or typos. There's no missing words or extra words. So the answer should be 1.
