gt_text: 86 23 39
vlm_output: BOSCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "86 23 39" and the VLM OCR output is "BOSCH". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "BOSCH".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three numbers: 86, 23, 39. The OCR output is a single word "BOSCH", which is a brand name, probably not related to the numbers. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the ground truth words are numbers, and the OCR output is a different word. There's no overlap in terms of words here. Even if we consider typos, "BOSCH" doesn't resemble any of the numbers. Also, the categories mention that if no words match, it's category 3. Since none of the numbers are present in the OCR output, the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 113
2. Slightly Correct Num: 52
3. Incorrect Num: 295
