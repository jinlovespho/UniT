gt_text: OX
vlm_output: Ox

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OX" and the VLM OCR output is "Ox". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Ox", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has the words "OX" and the OCR output has "Ox". 

Now, checking the unique words in the ground truth. Since "OX" is a single word, the unique words are just "OX". The OCR output has "Ox", which is the same word but with a lowercase 'x'. The problem states to ignore capitalization, so "Ox" and "OX" should be considered the same. 

Also, there's mention of ignoring extra or missing spaces. Here, both have no spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. In this case, the only difference is the capitalization of 'x', which is a minor case difference. 

Since the OCR output contains the same unique word as the ground truth, just with different capitalization, it should be considered a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
