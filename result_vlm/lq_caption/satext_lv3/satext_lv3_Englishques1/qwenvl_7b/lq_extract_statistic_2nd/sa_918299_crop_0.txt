gt_text: S32 32
vlm_output: Airport

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "S32 32" and the VLM OCR output is "Airport". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Airport", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "S32" and "32". The OCR output is "Airport", which is a single word. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "S32" and "32". Wait, but "S32" and "32" are different words, right? Even though they share the same numbers, the "S" makes them distinct. 

Now, the OCR output is "Airport", which is a completely different word. There's no overlap in the words between "Airport" and the ground truth. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "Airport" is a proper noun, and the ground truth has numbers. There's no way "Airport" can be considered a match for either "S32" or "32" even with case changes. 

Typos are considered as matches if they are small, but "Airport" isn't a typo of "S32" or "32". So no matches here. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect.
