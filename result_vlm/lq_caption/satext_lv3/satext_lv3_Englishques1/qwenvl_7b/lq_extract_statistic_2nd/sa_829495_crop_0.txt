gt_text: ÖZDEMİR BEY
vlm_output: SYBISSE 175

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ÖZDEMİR BEY" and the VLM OCR output is "SYBISSE 175". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SYBISSE 175". Now, the ground truth has two words: "ÖZDEMİR" and "BEY". The OCR output has "SYBISSE" and "175". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "ÖZDEMİR" and "BEY". The OCR output has "SYBISSE" and "175". Now, I need to check if any of these words match the ground truth words, considering the rules.

First, check for "ÖZDEMİR" in the OCR output. "SYBISSE" doesn't look like a typo of "ÖZDEMİR". The letters are different. "175" is a number, which doesn't match either "ÖZDEMİR" or "BEY". 

Then, check "BEY". The OCR output doesn't have "BEY" or any variation that could be considered a typo. "SYBISSE" is a different word, and "175" is a number. 

Since none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words, even considering typos, the category would be 3 — Incorrect. There's no match for either unique word in the ground truth. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
