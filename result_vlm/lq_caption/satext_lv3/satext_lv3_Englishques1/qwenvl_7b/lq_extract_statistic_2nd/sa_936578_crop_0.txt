gt_text: ART
vlm_output: ART

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ART" and the VLM OCR output is also "ART". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ART".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, they mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ART". The OCR output also has "ART". So the unique words match.

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. No issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are identical.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, and all conditions are met, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly correct.
