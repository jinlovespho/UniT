gt_text: AirAsia Asia
vlm_output: AirAsia

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AirAsia Asia" and the VLM OCR output is "AirAsia". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "AirAsia".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "AirAsia" and "Asia". The OCR output has only "AirAsia". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are "AirAsia" and "Asia". The OCR output has "AirAsia" but not "Asia". 

Even though "AirAsia" is present, the other word "Asia" is missing. The rules mention that for category 1, all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Since "Asia" isn't there, it can't be category 1. 

Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words matching. Here, one word ("AirAsia") matches, and the other doesn't. So this should be category 2. 

I should check if there are any typos or other factors. The OCR output is exactly "AirAsia", which is the same as the first word in the ground truth. No typos here. But since "Asia" is missing, it's not a full match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
