Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "100%", and the VLM OCR output is also "100%". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the OCR output.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has some specific rules. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are just one word, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "100%". The OCR output also has "100%", so the unique words match.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are exactly the same in terms of case and punctuation. There are no spaces to consider here.
- Small typos still count as matches. Well, there are no typos here because both are identical.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "100%", which is the same as the ground truth, this would be category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, so it's a correct match. No typos, no missing words, everything aligns. So the answer should be category 1.
