Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "maje" and the VLM OCR output is also "maje". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "maje", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "maje".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "maje". Now, the comparison rules are a bit specific. Let me go through them one by one.

First, word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "maje". The OCR output also has "maje", so the unique words match.

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So that's all good.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (which they do), it's category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. So the answer should be 1.
