gt_text: talabat
vlm_output: talabat

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "talabat" and the VLM OCR output is also "talabat". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are exactly the same. Also, we need to consider unique words in the ground truth. Since "talabat" is a single word, the set of unique words is just {"talabat"}.

The comparison should ignore capitalization, but both are lowercase here. Punctuation and spaces are also to be ignored. There are no extra spaces or punctuation in either case. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "talabat") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect elements here. The answer should be 1.
