gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "CODE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, let's go through the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "100%".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "CODE". The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "CODE". The OCR output is "100%". Now, the question is whether "100%" contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. Let's break it down.

First, check if "CODE" is present in "100%". The OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. The word "CODE" isn't in there. But maybe there's a typo or something? The problem says small typos still count as matches. However, "100%" doesn't have any letters that are close to "CODE". The letters are 1, 0, 0, %, which are numbers and a symbol. There's no overlap in letters with "CODE" (C, O, D, E). So even considering typos, there's no way "100%" could be a typo for "CODE". 

Next, considering the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, the only unique word is "CODE", which isn't present. So that's not category 1. 

Category 2 is slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and it's not present, this would not be category 2 either. 

Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated or empty. The OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated to "CODE". There's no overlap in words, so this falls into category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if there's any possible way that "100%" could be considered a match for "CODE" under the given rules. For example, if the OCR output had "code" or "c o d e" with spaces, but in this case, it's "100%", which is entirely different. So no, there's no match here. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 37
2. Slightly Correct Num: 19
3. Incorrect Num: 69
