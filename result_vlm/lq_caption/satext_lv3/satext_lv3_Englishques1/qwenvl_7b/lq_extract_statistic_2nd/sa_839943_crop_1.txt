Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "36 36 36" and the VLM OCR output is "47". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "47", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "36" repeated three times, but the unique word is just "36".

Now, the OCR output is "47". I need to check if "47" matches any of the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "36", and the OCR output is "47". These are different numbers. 

The guidelines mention that small typos still count as matches, but "47" isn't a typo of "36"; they're different numbers. Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since the OCR output has "47" which doesn't match "36" at all, there are no matches. Therefore, it falls under category 3, which is incorrect. The output is unrelated because it's a different number entirely. Even though there's only one word in the OCR output, it doesn't match the ground truth's unique word. So the answer should be 3.
