gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "HOLLYWOOD".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling. No typos mentioned. So the OCR output matches exactly.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's a Category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. So the answer should be 1.
