Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "88" and the VLM OCR output is also "88". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "88", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are just "88", there's only one word here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "88". The OCR output also has "88". 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, the ground truth has one unique word ("88") and the OCR output has the same. So that's a full match. 

No possibility of partial or incorrect here. So the answer should be 1.
