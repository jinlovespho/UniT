gt_text: MULTIPLEX
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "MULTIPLEX" and the VLM OCR output is "100". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers. The ground truth is the word "MULTIPLEX". 

Now, step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MULTIPLEX". The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not a word. 

The instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100" is a number, not a word. The ground truth is a word, and the OCR output is a number. Since there's no word in the OCR output that matches "MULTIPLEX" even with typos, because "100" isn't a typo of "MULTIPLEX" but a completely different type of data (number vs. word), there's no match. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, the ground truth has one word, which isn't present in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all. But since there are no words in the OCR output, this doesn't apply.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is numbers and not related to the word "MULTIPLEX", it's category 3.

I think the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 90
2. Slightly Correct Num: 38
3. Incorrect Num: 225
