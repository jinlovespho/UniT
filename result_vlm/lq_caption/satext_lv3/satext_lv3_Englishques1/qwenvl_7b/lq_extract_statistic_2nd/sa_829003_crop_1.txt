gt_text: EMPLOYEES ONLY
vlm_output: 1025

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES ONLY" and the VLM OCR output is "1025". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1025", which is a number. The ground truth has two words: "EMPLOYEES" and "ONLY". 

Now, comparing the extracted text "1025" with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is numbers, not words. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "EMPLOYEES" and "ONLY". The OCR output has "1025", which are digits. There's no overlap in words. Even if I consider typos, "1025" doesn't resemble either word. Since there's no match for any of the unique words, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match, and the output is unrelated.
