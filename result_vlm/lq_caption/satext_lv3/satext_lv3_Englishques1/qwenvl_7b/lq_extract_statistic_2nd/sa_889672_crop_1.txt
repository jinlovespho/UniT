Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "W" and the VLM OCR output is "w". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "w", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here since there's only one word. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "W", which is a single word. The OCR output has "w". 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization. So "W" and "w" are considered the same. Also, ignore extra or missing spaces, but there are no spaces here. Small typos count as matches, but there's no typo here—just a case difference. 

So the unique words in ground truth are {"W"}, and the OCR output has {"w"}. Since they are the same when case is ignored, this should be a correct match. Therefore, category 1 applies because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
