Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Platform" and the VLM OCR output is "Platform 1". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Platform 1". So the extracted text is "Platform 1".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Platform". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Platform".

Now, I need to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output has "Platform" and "1". The "Platform" matches exactly, and the "1" is an extra word. But the ground truth only has "Platform". 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. The OCR output has an extra word, "1", but the ground truth doesn't have that. However, the category is based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Platform" is present in the OCR output, and there are no other words in the ground truth, does that mean it's correct?

Wait, the ground truth has only one word. The OCR output includes that word plus another. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output has all the words in the ground truth (even if it has more), then it's category 1. 

So the ground truth's unique words are {"Platform"}. The OCR output's unique words are {"Platform", "1"}. The intersection is {"Platform"}, which includes all the ground truth words. Therefore, according to category 1, since all unique ground truth words are present, even if there are extra words, it's correct. 

But wait, the example given in the categories: category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear. So even if the OCR has more words, as long as all the ground truth words are there, it's category 1. So in this case, "Platform" is present, so it's category 1. 

But maybe the presence of "1" is a problem? The instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So "Platform 1" is considered as two words. But the ground truth has only one. However, the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output includes all of them, even if it has more, it's correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
