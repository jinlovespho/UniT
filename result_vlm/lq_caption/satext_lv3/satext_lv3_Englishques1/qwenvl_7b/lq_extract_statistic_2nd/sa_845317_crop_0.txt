gt_text: TEATRO SOLIS
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TEATRO SOLIS" and the VLM OCR output is also "TEATRO SOLIS". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are exactly the same.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but in this case, the words are in the same order. Also, they mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps, same spacing. No typos mentioned here. Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, even with those considerations, all unique words are present. 

So according to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no partial match here. The answer should be 1.
