gt_text: MANH HUNG CHU
vlm_output: Royal Engineers

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MANH HUNG CHU" and the VLM OCR output is "Royal Engineers". I need to compare these based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from OCR: "Royal Engineers". Then compare with ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter. The unique words in ground truth are "MANH", "HUNG", "CHU". But the OCR output has "Royal" and "Engineers". 

Wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So I need to check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. But the ground truth words are "MANH", "HUNG", "CHU", which are all Vietnamese names. The OCR output is "Royal Engineers", which are English words. There's no overlap in the words. Even if I ignore capitalization, "Royal" and "Engineers" don't match any of the ground truth words. 

So, the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. Because no words match, or the output is unrelated. Even though there's a possibility of typos, but in this case, the words are entirely different. So answer is 3.
