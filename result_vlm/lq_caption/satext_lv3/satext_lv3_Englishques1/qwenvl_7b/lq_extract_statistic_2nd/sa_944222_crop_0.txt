gt_text: PILOTS
vlm_output: PILOTS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PILOTS" and the VLM OCR output is also "PILOTS". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "PILOTS", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria given are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "PILOTS" is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Since both are the same, even if we ignore case (though they're both uppercase here), the words are identical. There are no typos, so that's a perfect match. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. 
Since the ground truth has only one unique word, "PILOTS", and the OCR output has that same word, it's a full match. 

No issues with order, case, spacing, or typos. So the answer should be category 1.
