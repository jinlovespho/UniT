gt_text: Canon
vlm_output: Canon

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Canon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Canon". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Canon".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth has one unique word: "Canon". The OCR output is "Canon". Let's check each condition. 

Since both are exactly the same, ignoring case (though they are both uppercase here), there's no difference. The unique words in ground truth are present in the OCR output. There are no typos, so even if there were, they would still count as matches. Since all unique words (just "Canon") are present, this should be category 1. 

No other words are involved, so it's a perfect match. The answer should be 1.
