gt_text: SST
vlm_output: The image provided is too low resolution to read any text clearly. It appears to show a kite with a pattern, but no discernible text can be made out. If you have a higher-resolution version of the image or more context, please provide it so I can assist further.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text "SST" and a VLM OCR output which is a paragraph explaining that the image is too low resolution to read any text clearly. The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text following specific rules.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that mentions the image is too low resolution, a kite with a pattern, and no discernible text. The key point is that the OCR output says there's no text that can be read.

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "SST". The rules for comparison are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has three letters: S, S, T. But when considering unique words, it's just the letters S and T. Wait, but the ground truth is "SST" which is three characters. However, the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, "SST" is a single word, but the unique words would be just "SST" if we consider it as a single word. But maybe the user is treating each character as a separate word? Hmm, that might be a confusion here. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the ground truth text is "SST". The VLM OCR output is a paragraph that says there's no text. So, the OCR output didn't detect any text, while the ground truth is "SST".

But according to the instructions, we need to compare the OCR output's text with the ground truth's unique words. The ground truth's unique words are just "SST" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output's text doesn't have the word "SST" in it. The OCR output says there's no text, so it's not detecting "SST".

But the category definitions are:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.

So, the ground truth has the word "SST" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output's text doesn't have that word. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Hence, the category would be 3 — Incorrect.

But wait, maybe the ground truth is three separate words: "S", "S", "T"? But the problem says "unique words", so "S" and "T". But the OCR output doesn't have any of those letters as words. The OCR output mentions "text", "kite", "pattern", etc., but not "S" or "T" as standalone words. So, even if we split "SST" into individual letters, the OCR output doesn't have "S" or "T" as words. Therefore, no matches.

Hence, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 90
2. Slightly Correct Num: 38
3. Incorrect Num: 224
