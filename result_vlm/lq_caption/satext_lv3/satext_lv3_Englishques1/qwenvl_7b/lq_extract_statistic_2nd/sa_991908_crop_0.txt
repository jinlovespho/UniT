gt_text: ONE WAY Av 4
vlm_output: 400

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ONE WAY Av 4" and the VLM OCR output is "400". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "400", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which has the words "ONE", "WAY", "Av", and "4".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words here are "ONE", "WAY", "Av", and "4". But the OCR output is "400", which is a single number. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. However, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "400" isn't "4" exactly, but maybe there's a typo consideration. Wait, the ground truth has "4" as a word, and the OCR has "400". But "400" isn't a typo of "4" in the sense that it's a different number. The instruction says small typos still count as matches. However, "400" isn't a small typo of "4"; it's a completely different number. So "4" in the ground truth isn't present in the OCR output. 

Also, the other words: "ONE", "WAY", "Av" – none of these are in the OCR output. The OCR output is just "400", which is a number. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "400" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos, it's category 3. The only possible match might be "4" vs "400", but since "400" is not a typo of "4" but a different number, it doesn't count. Therefore, the answer is 3.
