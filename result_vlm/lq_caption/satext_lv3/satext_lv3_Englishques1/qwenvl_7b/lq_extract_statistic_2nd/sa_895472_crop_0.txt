gt_text: OVO
vlm_output: OVO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "OVO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OVO". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's already "OVO".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OVO". The OCR output has the same word. So, considering all the factors: ignoring case (both are uppercase), spacing (no spaces in either), and typos (there are none here), it seems like they match perfectly.

The categories are 1 for correct, which requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, category 1 applies. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. So the answer should be 1.
