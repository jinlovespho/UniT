gt_text: foodpanda
vlm_output: foodpanda

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "foodpanda" and the VLM OCR output is also "foodpanda". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly the same word. Also, they mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "foodpanda". The OCR output also has "foodpanda". 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are lowercase with no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So all unique ground truth words (just "foodpanda") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial correctness here because there's only one word, and it's exactly matched. So the answer should be category 1.
