gt_text: OFFICE POST
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OFFICE POST" and the VLM OCR output is "POST OFFICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "POST OFFICE", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that shouldn't affect the comparison. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "OFFICE" and "POST". The OCR output has "POST" and "OFFICE", which are the same words. 

Now, checking for case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are in uppercase, so no issue there. There are no punctuation marks or extra spaces to worry about. 

The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. In this case, there are no typos; the words are exactly the same. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1: Correct. 

I don't see any missing words or mismatches here. Even if the order was different, since the instruction says order doesn't matter, it's still a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
