gt_text: LOTILA VARATTU P
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LOTILA VARATTU P" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "LOTILA", "VARATTU", and "P". 

The instructions say to consider word order as not important, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three unique words. However, the OCR output is "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. 

Now, checking if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output doesn't have "LOTILA", "VARATTU", or "P". The OCR output is "100%", which is a numerical value. There's no overlap in words here. 

The criteria also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But even if we consider that, "100%" is a number and doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. The typos part says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo because the OCR output is entirely different. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
