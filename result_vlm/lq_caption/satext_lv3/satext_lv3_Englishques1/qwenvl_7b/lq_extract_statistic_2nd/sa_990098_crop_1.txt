gt_text: Card only
vlm_output: Card only

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Card only" and the VLM OCR output is also "Card only". So, first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are exactly the same. Now, comparing them based on the given criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, the words are in the same order. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Card" and "only". The OCR output has the same two words. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both "Card" and "only" are in the same case here. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored, but there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1, which is correct. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if the order was different, since the words are the same, it's still category 1. So the answer should be 1.
