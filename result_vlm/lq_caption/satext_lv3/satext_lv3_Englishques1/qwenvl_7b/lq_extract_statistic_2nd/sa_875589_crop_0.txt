Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "4022 Rossau". The VLM OCR output says, "The image appears to be of a river scene with a boat, but there is no visible text in the image."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is talking about an image of a river scene with a boat and mentions no visible text. So the actual words here are "The", "image", "appears", "to", "be", "of", "a", "river", "scene", "with", "boat", "but", "there", "is", "no", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image".

Now, the ground truth has "4022" and "Rossau". The OCR output doesn't mention either of these words. The OCR output is describing the image content, not providing any text from the image. The user's instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words here are "4022" and "Rossau".

Looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of "4022" or "Rossau". The OCR output says there's no visible text, which might imply that the OCR didn't find any text, but the ground truth is that the text is "4022 Rossau". However, the OCR output is not providing the text content; instead, it's describing the image. So the extracted text from the OCR output doesn't include the ground truth words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since neither "4022" nor "Rossau" are present in the OCR output, the answer should be category 3.
