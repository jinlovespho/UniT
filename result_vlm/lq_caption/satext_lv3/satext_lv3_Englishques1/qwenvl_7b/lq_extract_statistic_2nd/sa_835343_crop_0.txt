gt_text: il Presidente Presidente
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "il Presidente Presidente" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this with the ground truth, which is "il Presidente Presidente". 

The ground truth has two unique words: "il" and "Presidente". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we look at unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "10%" is not a word that's in the ground truth. Also, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but even so, "10%" doesn't match "il" or "Presidente". 

Small typos are considered matches, but here there's no typo—there's just a completely different content. Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls into category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
