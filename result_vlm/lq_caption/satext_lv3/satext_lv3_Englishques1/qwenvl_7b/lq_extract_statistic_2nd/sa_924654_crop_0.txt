gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: RESTAURACJA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, the extracted text is "RESTAURACJA".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result here. But in this case, both texts are identical.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RESTAURACJA". The OCR output also has the same word. 

I need to ignore capitalization, but both are in uppercase, so that's not an issue here. There are no punctuation marks or extra spaces to consider since the text is a single word. Also, there are no typos because the OCR output matches exactly.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
