gt_text: APPLE BARN Old
vlm_output: OldAPPLEBARN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APPLE BARN Old" and the OCR output is "OldAPPLEBARN". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "OldAPPLEBARN". Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified conditions.

The key points to remember are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has three words: "APPLE", "BARN", and "Old". The OCR output is "OldAPPLEBARN", which when we ignore spaces, becomes "OldAPPLEBARN". Let's break it down.

First, let's normalize both texts. The ground truth words are "APPLE", "BARN", "Old". The OCR output is "OldAPPLEBARN". If we split the OCR output into words without considering spaces, but since there are no spaces, maybe we need to look for the presence of the words as substrings, but the problem says to compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has three unique words: "APPLE", "BARN", "Old". The OCR output is a single string "OldAPPLEBARN".

But how do we split the OCR output into words? The original ground truth has spaces, but the OCR output doesn't. However, the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe we should treat the OCR output as a concatenation of the words without spaces. So, "OldAPPLEBARN" would be considered as the words "Old", "APPLE", "BARN" when split appropriately, even though there are no spaces. But since the OCR output is a single string, perhaps we need to check if all the words from the ground truth are present as substrings, regardless of their order and case.

Wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has three words: "APPLE", "BARN", "Old". The OCR output is "OldAPPLEBARN". Let's check each word:

- "Old" is present as the first part of the OCR output.
- "APPLE" is present in the OCR output as "APPLE".
- "BARN" is present as "BARN" in the OCR output.

But since the OCR output is a single string without spaces, but the words are contiguous. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So even if the OCR output is a single string, as long as all the words from the ground truth are present as substrings (case-insensitive), then it's considered correct.

So, checking each word:

- "Old" is present as "Old" at the beginning.
- "APPLE" is present as "APPLE".
- "BARN" is present as "BARN".

Therefore, all three words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though they are concatenated. Since the order doesn't matter, and the words are all there, even with no spaces, it's considered correct. Also, there are no typos mentioned here, just the lack of spaces. The instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, so the absence of spaces shouldn't affect the match.

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
