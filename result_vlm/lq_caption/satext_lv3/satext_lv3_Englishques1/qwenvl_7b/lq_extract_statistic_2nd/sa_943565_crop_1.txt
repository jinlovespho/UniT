gt_text: Dunelm
vlm_output: Dunelm

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Dunelm" and the VLM OCR output is also "Dunelm". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Dunelm".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Dunelm". The OCR output also has "Dunelm". 

Next, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation to consider here. Also, small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case since they're identical.

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
