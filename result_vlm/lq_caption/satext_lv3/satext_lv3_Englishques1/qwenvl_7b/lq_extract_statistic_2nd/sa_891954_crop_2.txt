gt_text: 101

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "101" and the VLM OCR output is also "101". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since both are just the number 101.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, "101" is a single number. So the ground truth has one unique word, which is "101". The OCR output is also "101", so the extracted text is the same.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. The OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. So that would be category 1.

I need to make sure there's no typo or anything. The OCR output is exactly "101", same as the ground truth. So even if there were a typo, like "10a", but in this case, it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
