gt_text: Ingeborg STOCKHOLM
vlm_output: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "Ingeborg STOCKHOLM". The VLM OCR output is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is the sentence about the fox and the dog. So that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So let's break down the ground truth. The unique words here are "Ingeborg" and "STOCKHOLM". Let's note that "STOCKHOLM" is a proper noun, likely a name or place. Now, the OCR output has words like "The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "lazy", "dog". 

Now, checking if any of these words match the ground truth words. The ground truth words are "Ingeborg" and "STOCKHOLM". The OCR output doesn't have "Ingeborg" or "Stockholm" (even if we ignore case, "stockholm" isn't in the OCR text). The OCR output has completely different words. 

So, considering that the unique words in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output, even when ignoring case, punctuation, etc., there's no match. The OCR output is a completely different set of words. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. Even if there were typos, like if "Ingeborg" was misspelled as "Ingeborgh" or something, but here it's not even close. The OCR output is entirely different words. So no matches at all. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
