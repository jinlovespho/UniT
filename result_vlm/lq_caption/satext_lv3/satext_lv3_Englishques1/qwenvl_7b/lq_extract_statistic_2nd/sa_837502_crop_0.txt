gt_text: LV
vlm_output: LV

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LV" and the VLM OCR output is also "LV". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "LV", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has "LV" which is two letters. The OCR output is exactly the same. Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "LV" (assuming it's a single word here). The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are exactly the same, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
