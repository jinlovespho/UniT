gt_text: 山公園 08
vlm_output: united

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "山公園 08" and the VLM OCR output is "united". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "united". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "山公園" which is a Japanese term meaning "mountain park" and "08" which is a number. The OCR output is "united", which is an English word.

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "山公園" and "08". The OCR output is "united", which is a single word. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos, case, or spacing, there's no match. "united" doesn't resemble "山公園" or "08" in any way. The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none. 

In this case, none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. So it's category 3.
