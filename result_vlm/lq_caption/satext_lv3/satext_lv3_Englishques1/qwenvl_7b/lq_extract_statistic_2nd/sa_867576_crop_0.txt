gt_text: WDR
vlm_output: WDR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "WDR" and the VLM OCR output is also "WDR". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, for the comparison. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same three-letter acronym. The ground truth has only one unique word, which is "WDR". The OCR output also has "WDR" as the only word. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word, and it's present, that should be a 1. The other factors like capitalization, spacing, and typos are mentioned, but since they are the same here, those don't affect it. There's no mention of typos in this case. So the answer should be category 1.
