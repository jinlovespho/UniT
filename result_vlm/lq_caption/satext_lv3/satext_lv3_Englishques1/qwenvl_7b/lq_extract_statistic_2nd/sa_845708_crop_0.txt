gt_text: HOTEL DI MARE MERCANTI
vlm_output: CABO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOTEL DI MARE MERCANTI" and the VLM OCR output is "CABO". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "CABO". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "HOTEL", "DI", "MARE", "MERCANTI". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "CABO", which is a single word. Comparing each word from the ground truth to "CABO": "HOTEL" vs "CABO" – no match. "DI" – no. "MARE" – no. "MERCANTI" – no. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since none of the words match, it should be category 3. Also, "CABO" is unrelated to the hotel name, so that's definitely incorrect.
