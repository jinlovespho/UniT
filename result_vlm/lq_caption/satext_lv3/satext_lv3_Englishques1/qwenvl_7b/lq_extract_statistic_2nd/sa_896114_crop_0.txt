gt_text: DAF
vlm_output: ABC

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DAF" and the VLM OCR output is "ABC". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's "ABC".

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "DAF", which is one word. The OCR output is "ABC", which is another single word.

Now, checking if the OCR output contains all unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has "DAF" as the only unique word. The OCR output is "ABC". Are these considered a match? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "DAF" and "ABC" are completely different. There's no overlap in letters. So even with typos, they aren't close. For example, if the OCR had "Daf" or "DAF" with some minor errors, but here it's entirely different letters. 

Also, considering case doesn't matter. But "DAF" vs "abc" would still be different. Since the OCR output has no letters that match the ground truth word, there's no match. So the category would be 3, which is incorrect because no words match. The output is unrelated. So the answer is 3.
