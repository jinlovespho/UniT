gt_text: YELLOW YELLOW
vlm_output: YELLO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "YELLOW YELLOW". The VLM OCR output is "YELLO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "YELLO".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "YELLOW" repeated, but unique words would just be {"YELLOW"}.

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. So the OCR output is "YELLO" which is missing the last 'W' compared to "YELLOW". But the note says small typos still count as matches. So "YELLO" is a typo of "YELLOW" (missing a letter), but is that considered a small typo?

Wait, the problem says "small typos still count as matches". So if the OCR output has a typo that's small, like one missing letter, does that count as a match? The example here is "YELLO" vs "YELLOW". The OCR output is missing the 'W', so it's "YELLO" instead of "YELLOW". Is that considered a small typo?

If the OCR output has "YELLO", which is one letter short, maybe that's considered a small typo. So the unique word in ground truth is "YELLOW", and the OCR output has "YELLO" which is a typo. So that would count as a match. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just "YELLOW") appear in the OCR output (as "YELLO" is a typo). So category 1: correct.

But wait, maybe the OCR output is "YELLO" which is only 5 letters, while "YELLOW" is 6 letters. Is that considered a small typo? The instructions say small typos still count as matches. So perhaps even if it's missing a letter, it's considered a match. So the answer would be category 1.

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is missing a word. The ground truth has two "YELLOW"s, but the OCR output has only one word "YELLO". But since the comparison is based on the set of unique words, and the ground truth has only "YELLOW" as the unique word. The OCR output has "YELLO" which is considered a match (due to typo), so category 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.
