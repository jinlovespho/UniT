gt_text: Murray Murray
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Murray Murray" and the VLM OCR output is "1970". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "1970". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of the word "Murray". The OCR output is a number, "1970". 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The unique word here is "Murray". However, the OCR output has "1970", which is a number, not the word "Murray". 

The instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, but "1970" is a number, not a word. Also, typos are considered matches, but "1970" isn't a typo of "Murray"—they are completely different. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain the word "Murray" at all. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated (a number instead of a name), so category 3 is correct.
