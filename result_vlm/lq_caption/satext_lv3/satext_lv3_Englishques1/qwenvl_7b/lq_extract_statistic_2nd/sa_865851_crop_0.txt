gt_text: SALVADOR DALI
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SALVADOR DALI" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, moving to Step 2, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison rules are a bit specific, so I need to check each one carefully.

The first rule is that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, the OCR output is "100%", which is a single word (or a number with a percentage sign), whereas the ground truth has two words: "SALVADOR" and "DALI". So, even if order didn't matter, the OCR output doesn't have either of these words. 

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "SALVADOR" and "DALI". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. So, there's no overlap in the words here. 

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, the OCR output isn't even close to the words in the ground truth. "100%" is a numerical value, not related to the names "Salvador" or "Dali". 

The note about small typos still counting as matches is probably not applicable here because there's no typo of the actual words. The OCR output is entirely different in content.

So, according to the categories, Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since neither "SALVADOR" nor "DALI" are present in "100%", this isn't Category 1. Category 2 is for when at least one but not all unique words match. But again, there are no matches here. Therefore, it falls into Category 3, which is when no words match or the output is unrelated. 

I should also check if "100%" could be considered a typo or some form of the names, but that seems highly unlikely. "100%" is a number, not a name. So, the conclusion is Category 3.
