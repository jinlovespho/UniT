gt_text: AMP
vlm_output: AMP

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "AMP".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "AMP". The OCR output also has "AMP". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are uppercase and no spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, the category is 1 because all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "AMP") are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words, and everything matches. So the answer should be 1.
