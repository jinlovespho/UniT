gt_text: POLITIE POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLITIE POLITIE" and the VLM OCR output is "POLITIE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "POLITIE", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two instances of "POLITIE", but since we're looking at unique words, it's just one unique word: "POLITIE". The OCR output also has "POLITIE" once. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, so that's the same. There's no punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since both are exactly "POLITIE".

So the unique words in ground truth are {"POLITIE"}, and the OCR output has {"POLITIE"}. All unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be correct. 

I don't see any missing words or mismatches. Even though the ground truth has two words, the unique set is just one, and the OCR output has that same word. So the answer should be category 1.
