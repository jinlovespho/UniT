Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a ground truth text which is "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A" and a VLM OCR output that says the image doesn't have any English text and describes a cityscape. 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a paragraph explaining that there's no visible English text in the image. So the extracted text would be all that text, but we need to focus on the actual words present.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-A". But since we're considering unique words, the ground truth has two unique words: "HEUNG-" and "HEUNG-A" (assuming the hyphens are part of the words). Wait, actually, looking at the ground truth, it's "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A". So splitting by spaces, the words are "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-A". But unique words would be "HEUNG-" and "HEUNG-A".

Now, the OCR output's extracted text is a description about the image not containing English text. The words in the OCR output are: "The", "image", "provided", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text", "It", "appears", "to", "be", "a", "low-resolution", "image", "of", "a", "cityscape", "at", "dusk", "or", "dawn", "with", "buildings", "and", "a", "crane", "visible", "If", "you", "have", "any", "specific", "questions", "about", "the", "image", "or", "need", "further", "assistance", "feel", "free", "to", "ask".

Looking for any matches between these words and the ground truth words. The ground truth words are "HEUNG-" and "HEUNG-A". The OCR output has words like "HEUNG" (but without the hyphen?), but wait, the OCR output's text is all in English and doesn't mention "HEUNG" at all. The OCR output says there's no visible English text, so it's not recognizing any text, including the "HEUNG-" parts. Therefore, the OCR output does not contain the words "HEUNG-" or "HEUNG-A". 

So, according to the criteria: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is unrelated (it's saying there's no text, but the ground truth is text that's supposed to be there), this would fall into Category 3.
