gt_text: LEBEN SCHONES
vlm_output: 1028

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LEBEN SCHONES" and the VLM OCR output is "1028". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1028", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth is "LEBEN SCHONES", which are two German words. 

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. We should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "LEBEN" and "SCHONES". 

But the OCR output is "1028", which are numbers. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, the OCR output doesn't have any letters—only numbers. So, there's no overlap in terms of words. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

Also, the rules state that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are no letters in the OCR output to compare with the ground truth words. Therefore, there's no match at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth, it's category 3.
