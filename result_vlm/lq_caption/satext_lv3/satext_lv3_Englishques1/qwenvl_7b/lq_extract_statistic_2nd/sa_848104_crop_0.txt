gt_text: OPEL
vlm_output: OPEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OPEL" and the VLM OCR output is also "OPEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "OPEL".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same. 

The comparison should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "OPEL". The OCR output also has "OPEL". Since they're identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The guidelines also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. However, in this case, both are uppercase and have no punctuation or spaces. There are no typos to consider here because the OCR output matches exactly. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
