gt_text: SMOKING
vlm_output: SMOKING

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SMOKING" and the VLM OCR output is also "SMOKING". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "SMOKING", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SMOKING". The OCR output also has "SMOKING". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So the category is 1 — Correct, because all unique ground truth words (just "SMOKING") are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words or mismatches. Even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches, but here there are none. So the answer should be 1.
