gt_text: ARMARIS
vlm_output: 1234567890

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ARMARIS" and the VLM OCR output is "1234567890". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a string of numbers: "1234567890". Now, comparing this to the ground truth "ARMARIS", which is a word, probably a name or a specific term.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "ARMARIS". The OCR output has numbers, which are not words. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "ARMARIS" is the only unique word in the ground truth, I need to check if that word appears in the OCR output. However, the OCR output is entirely numbers. There's no "ARMARIS" or any variation of it. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But the OCR output doesn't have any letters at all. It's all digits. So even if I consider typos, there's no way the numbers can be a typo of "ARMARIS". 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and empty in terms of matching the required words. So the answer should be 3.
