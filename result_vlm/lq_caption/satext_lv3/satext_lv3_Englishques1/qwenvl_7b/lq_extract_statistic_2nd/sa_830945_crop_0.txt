gt_text: HYBRID4
vlm_output: HYBRID4

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HYBRID4". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There's no typo either since they're identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches exactly, even though the OCR output is the same, it's still a correct match. So the answer should be 1.
