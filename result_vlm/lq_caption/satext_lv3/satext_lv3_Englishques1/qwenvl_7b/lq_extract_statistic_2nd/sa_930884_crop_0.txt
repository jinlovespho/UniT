gt_text: AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD
vlm_output: ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD" and the VLM OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". There are no spaces here, so the words are all stuck together. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER", and "ETIHAD". The OCR output has the letters ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER. Let me break this down. 

If I look at the OCR output, maybe it's combining the words without spaces. So "ETIHAD" is part of the OCR output. Then "AIRWAYS" and "PARTNER" are also present. Let me check each word. 

"ETIHAD" is in the OCR output as "ETIHAD". The ground truth has "ETIHAD" as a separate word. Then "AIRWAYS" is in the OCR output as "AIRWAYS" (since the OCR output has "AIRWAYSPARTNER" after ETIHAD, but without spaces). Wait, the OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER", so breaking that down, maybe it's "ETIHAD" + "AIRWAYS" + "PARTNER" all stuck together. 

So the OCR output has all three words: ETIHAD, AIRWAYS, PARTNER. Even though they are concatenated without spaces, the problem states to ignore extra/missing spaces. So the words are present in the OCR output, just without spaces. Also, the case doesn't matter, and typos are considered matches. 

Since all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even if they are concatenated, the answer should be category 1. There's no missing word. The OCR output includes all three words. So the answer is 1.
