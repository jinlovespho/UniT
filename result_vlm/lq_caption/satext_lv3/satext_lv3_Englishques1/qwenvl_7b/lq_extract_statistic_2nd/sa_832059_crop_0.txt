gt_text: SUZUKI
vlm_output: OUTBOARD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SUZUKI" and the VLM OCR output is "OUTBOARD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "OUTBOARD".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos are okay. 

So, the ground truth has one unique word: "SUZUKI". The OCR output is "OUTBOARD", which is a single word. Now, checking if "OUTBOARD" matches "SUZUKI" considering the rules. 

But "OUTBOARD" and "SUZUKI" are completely different words. There's no overlap in letters or possible typos that could make them match. Even if we ignore case, "outboard" vs "suzuki" don't have any common letters that would suggest a typo. The category rules say that if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. 

So, since there's no match at all, the answer should be 3.
