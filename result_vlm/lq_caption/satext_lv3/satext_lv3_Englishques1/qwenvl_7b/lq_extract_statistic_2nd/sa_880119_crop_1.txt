gt_text: KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON
vlm_output: KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON" and the VLM OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has the words "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", and "ON".

Next, I need to check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Let's break it down:

- Ground truth words: KOMMUNISM, VANGLA, ON.
- OCR output words: KOMMUNISM, ON, VANGLA.

Looking at these, all three words are present in both the ground truth and the OCR output. The order is different (VANGLA is first in the ground truth, but in the OCR it's third), but the problem states that word order doesn't matter. Also, there are no typos mentioned here; the words are the same. Capitalization and spacing are ignored as per the instructions. So, even though the order is different, all the required words are there.

Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos)", this should be category 1.
