Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "123 23", and the VLM OCR output is "The image shows a close-up of a bicycle seat and part of the frame, but there is no visible text in the image."

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence describing an image of a bicycle seat and frame, mentioning there's no visible text. So the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence.

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the numbers "123" and "23". The OCR output doesn't have any numbers; it's all descriptive words about a bicycle. 

The comparison rules say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "123" and "23". Now, looking at the OCR output, there are no numbers. All the words in the OCR output are things like "image", "shows", "close-up", "bicycle", "seat", etc. None of these match "123" or "23".

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is wrong. Since the OCR output has no numbers, and the ground truth is entirely numbers, there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3.

2. Slightly Correct Num: 107
3. Incorrect Num: 604
