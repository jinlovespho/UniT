gt_text: 911 EMERGENCY
vlm_output: 911

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "911 EMERGENCY" and the VLM OCR output is "911". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "911". Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified factors.

The ground truth has two words: "911" and "EMERGENCY". The OCR output only has "911". Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "911" and "EMERGENCY". The OCR output has "911" but not "EMERGENCY".

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Here, the OCR output has one of the two words. So that would be category 2, slightly correct. But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo, just a missing word. The output is "911" which is exactly the same as the ground truth's first word. So, since "911" is present, but "EMERGENCY" is missing, that's at least one but not all. Therefore, category 2.
