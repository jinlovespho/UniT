gt_text: DiGi DiGi DiGi DiGi
vlm_output: The image appears to be very blurry, making it difficult to read any text. If there is any text present, it is not legible due to the image quality.

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "DiGi DiGi DiGi DiGi". So the unique word here is "DiGi". The VLM OCR output says the image is blurry and the text isn't legible. 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a description of the image being blurry, not actual text. So the extracted text would be phrases like "blurry", "difficult to read", "not legible", etc. There's no mention of "DiGi" or any similar words.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The unique word in the ground truth is "DiGi". The OCR output doesn't have that word. It's talking about the image quality issues. Even if we consider typos, there's no "DiGi" or any variation of it. The OCR didn't recognize any text, so there's no match. 

Looking at the categories: Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output doesn't mention "DiGi" at all and is instead explaining the image quality, it's unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
