gt_text: easyJet
vlm_output: easyJet

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but in this case, there's only one word. So that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet". The OCR output has the same word. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since both are exactly the same in this case, those factors don't affect the comparison. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no partial correctness or incorrectness here. The answer should be category 1.
