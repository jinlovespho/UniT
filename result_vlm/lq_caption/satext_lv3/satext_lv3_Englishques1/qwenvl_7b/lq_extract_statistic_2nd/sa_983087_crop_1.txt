gt_text: BONIA
vlm_output: BONIA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BONIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "BONIA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "BONIA", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has one word: "BONIA". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if we consider case (but both are uppercase here), there's no difference. There are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "BONIA" and the OCR output has exactly that, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
