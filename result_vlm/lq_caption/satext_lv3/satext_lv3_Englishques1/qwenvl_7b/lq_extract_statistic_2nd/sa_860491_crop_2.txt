gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "POLIZEI". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps, so that's not an issue here. Punctuation and spaces aren't present, so those don't affect it. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "POLIZEI" is exactly matched, the answer should be 1.
