gt_text: IKEA
vlm_output: IKEA

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "IKEA" and the VLM OCR output is also "IKEA". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "IKEA", that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "IKEA". The OCR output also has "IKEA". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, that should be category 1. The answer is 1.
