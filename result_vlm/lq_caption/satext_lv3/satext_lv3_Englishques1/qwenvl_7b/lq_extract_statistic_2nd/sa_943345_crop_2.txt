gt_text: INS ROCK
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INS ROCK" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just the number 10 followed by a percentage sign. 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "INS" and "ROCK". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "10%" isn't "INS" or "ROCK". Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but even if we remove the percentage sign, "10" is still not matching "INS" or "ROCK". 

Small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's a complete mismatch. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the expected words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
