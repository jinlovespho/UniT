gt_text: POLICE
vlm_output: POLICE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLICE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "POLICE", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POLICE". The OCR output also has "POLICE". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. The answer is definitely category 1.
