Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BSN" and the VLM OCR output is also "BSN". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors.

First, word order doesn't matter. Since both are just "BSN", the order is the same, but even if it were different, like "NBS", it would still be okay. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BSN". The OCR output also has "BSN". So they match exactly.

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so no issue there. Punctuation and spaces aren't present here, so that's not a factor. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (just "BSN") are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. The answer should be 1.
