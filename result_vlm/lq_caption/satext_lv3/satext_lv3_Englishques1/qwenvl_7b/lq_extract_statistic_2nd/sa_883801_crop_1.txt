gt_text: MIRA EKONOMI
vlm_output: MIRA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MIRA EKONOMI" and the VLM OCR output is "MIRA". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "MIRA". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two words: "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output has only "MIRA". Now, considering that we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output has "MIRA" but not "EKONOMI". 

So, the OCR output has one of the two unique words. According to the categories, category 1 is when all unique words match. Since only one matches, that would be category 2, which is partially correct. Even though there's a typo, but here there's no typo, just a missing word. Also, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo, just a missing word. So, since at least one word matches, but not all, it's category 2.
