gt_text: D'ARTE
vlm_output: D'ARTE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "D'ARTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "D'ARTE". So, first step is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to the comparison. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The next point is comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "D'ARTE". The OCR output also has "D'ARTE". 

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation to consider here except the apostrophe in "D'ARTE", which is present in both.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is identical to the ground truth. 

So, all unique ground truth words (just "D'ARTE") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, partial matches, or any issues. The output is exactly correct.
