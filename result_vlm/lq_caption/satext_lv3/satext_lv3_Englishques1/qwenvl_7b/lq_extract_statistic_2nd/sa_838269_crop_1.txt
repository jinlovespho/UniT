Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly "Google". 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output also has "Google". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though the order doesn't matter, here they are the same. Also, capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase here. No typos, no extra spaces. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. So the answer is 1.
