gt_text: Dior CONGRATULATIONS
vlm_output: CONGRATULATIONS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Dior CONGRATULATIONS" and the VLM OCR output is "CONGRATULATIONS". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "CONGRATULATIONS".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has two words: "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output has only "CONGRATULATIONS". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output has "CONGRATULATIONS" but is missing "Dior". 

According to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the two is present. So that's not category 1. Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all match. Since "CONGRATULATIONS" is present, even though "Dior" is missing, it should be category 2. 

Wait, but the OCR output doesn't have "Dior" at all. So only one of the two words is present. So that's at least one but not all. So category 2. 

I should check if there's any possibility that "Dior" is considered a typo or something. But the OCR output doesn't have "Dior" in any form. So no match there. Therefore, category 2.
