gt_text: ANNA
vlm_output: The image contains the following text: "100%".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ANNA" and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the following text: "100%."."

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The image contains the following text: "100%."." So the extracted text would be "The image contains the following text: 100%." I need to ignore any formatting like quotes or punctuation, but the problem says to ignore punctuation, so maybe just take the words.

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ANNA", which is a single word. The OCR output has "100%" as the main text. Let's break down the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word in ground truth, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "ANNA" as the only unique word.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "ANNA" vs. "anna" or "Anna" would be considered same. But the OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is a name, so "ANNA" is a word, and the OCR output has "100%", which is a number. 

Now, considering the categories:

Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. The ground truth has "ANNA", but the OCR output has "100%". These are different words. Even if we ignore punctuation, "100%" becomes "100", which is a number, not the word "ANNA". So there's no match here.

Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match. But since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, if it's not present, then it's not partially correct. Wait, the OCR output doesn't have "ANNA" at all. So there's zero matches. 

Category 3: Incorrect. No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since "100%" is unrelated to "ANNA", and there's no match, this would fall under category 3.

But wait, maybe I should check if "100%" could be considered a typo or similar to "ANNA"? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "100%" is not a typo of "ANNA"; they are entirely different. So no match. Therefore, the answer is 3.
