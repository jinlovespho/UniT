gt_text: VERITÀ PE
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VERITÀ PE" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth has two words: "VERITÀ" and "PE". 

Now, comparing the extracted text "10%" with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is "10%", which is a numerical value with a percentage symbol. The ground truth words are "VERITÀ" and "PE", which are words, not numbers. 

Considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "10%" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. "VERITÀ" is a word meaning "truth" in Italian, and "PE" could be an abbreviation or a word. The OCR output has no letters in common with these words. There's no mention of numbers or percentages in the ground truth, so there's no overlap here.

Also, the rules state that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in words at all. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of content. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, so the answer should be category 3.
