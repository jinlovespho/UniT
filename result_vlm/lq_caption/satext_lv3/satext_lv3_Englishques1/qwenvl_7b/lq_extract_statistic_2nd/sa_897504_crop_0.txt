gt_text: Google

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Google".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Google". The OCR output has the same word. Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since both are exactly "Google", there's no issue there. Also, small typos are considered matches. But there are no typos here.

So, since all unique ground truth words (which is just "Google") are present in the OCR output, that should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or any issues. The answer should be 1.
