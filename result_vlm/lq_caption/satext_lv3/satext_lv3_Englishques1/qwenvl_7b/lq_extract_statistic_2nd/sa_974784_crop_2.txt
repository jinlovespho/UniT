gt_text: FRESH MANGO
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FRESH MANGO" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this with the ground truth, which is "FRESH MANGO". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "FRESH" and "MANGO". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Looking at the categories: 

- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But "10%" doesn't have either "FRESH" or "MANGO". 

- Category 2 is partially correct if at least one word matches. However, "10%" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

- Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "10%" is unrelated to "FRESH MANGO" and doesn't have any matching words, this would fall under category 3. 

I should also check if there's any possibility of a typo or different interpretation. For example, maybe "10%" is a typo for "FRESH" or "MANGO", but that seems unlikely. The OCR output is a number, not words. So no words match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
