gt_text: EESTI VABADUSSÖDA 1918 1920
vlm_output: ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "EESTI VABADUSSÖDA 1918 1920" and the OCR output is "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "ALEXANDER VANDERNYDE". Now, comparing this with the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into unique words. The ground truth has "EESTI", "VABADUSSÖDA", "1918", "1920". So those are the four unique words.

Next, the OCR output has "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE". Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the unique words in the ground truth are "EESTI", "VABADUSSÖDA", "1918", "1920". The OCR output has "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE". 

Looking for any matches. Let's check each word. "EESTI" is a proper noun, probably the Estonian word for "Estonia". The OCR output has "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE" which don't seem related. "VABADUSSÖDA" is "Independence Day" in Estonian. "1918" and "1920" are years. The OCR output has no numbers, and the words "ALEXANDER" and "VANDERNYDE" are names, not related to the ground truth words. 

So, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if I consider possible typos, like maybe "VANDERNYDE" could be a misspelling of something else, but "VABADUSSÖDA" is specific. There's no overlap. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. 

So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. But wait, the category 3 says "no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since the OCR output has words that are unrelated (names) instead of the actual ground truth words, it's definitely category 3.
