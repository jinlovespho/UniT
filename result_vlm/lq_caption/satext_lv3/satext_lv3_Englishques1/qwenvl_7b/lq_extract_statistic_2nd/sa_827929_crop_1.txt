gt_text: EEN 1-125
vlm_output: PILGRIM

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EEN 1-125" and the VLM OCR output is "PILGRIM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "PILGRIM". Next, I compare this with the ground truth. 

The ground truth has the words "EEN" and "1-125". The OCR output is "PILGRIM", which is a single word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, I should ignore case, punctuation, and spaces. But here, the OCR output is a single word, and the ground truth has two distinct words. 

Looking at "EEN" and "1-125" versus "PILGRIM". There's no overlap in the words. "EEN" is a Dutch word meaning "one" but in this context, it's part of the ground truth. The number "1-125" is a range, and "PILGRIM" is unrelated. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even considering possible typos (but "PILGRIM" doesn't resemble "EEN" or "1-125"), the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
