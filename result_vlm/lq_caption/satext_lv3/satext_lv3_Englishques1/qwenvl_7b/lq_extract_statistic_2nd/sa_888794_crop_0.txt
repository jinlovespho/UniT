gt_text: SAM'S TOWN
vlm_output: SAM'S TOWN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SAM'S TOWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "SAM'S TOWN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "SAM'S TOWN".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "SAM'S" and "TOWN". The OCR output is exactly the same. So when we look at the unique words in the ground truth, both are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like if it was "SAMs TOWN" or "Sam's town", it would still count as correct because of the rules mentioned. Since there are no differences here, all unique words match. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words, and the order doesn't matter but in this case, the order is the same. So the answer is 1.
