gt_text: HORVE 13
vlm_output: 13

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HORVE 13" and the VLM OCR output is "13". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is just "13", so that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "HORVE 13", the unique words are "HORVE" and "13". The OCR output is "13". So, the OCR output contains the word "13", which is one of the unique words from the ground truth. However, it's missing "HORVE".

Now, the categories are defined as follows:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
- Category 2: At least one but not all unique words match.
- Category 3: No words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

In this case, the OCR output has one of the two unique words from the ground truth. So, it's partially correct. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be Category 2. The OCR missed "HORVE" but correctly captured "13". Since it's not all words, but at least one, it's slightly correct. The answer should be 2.
