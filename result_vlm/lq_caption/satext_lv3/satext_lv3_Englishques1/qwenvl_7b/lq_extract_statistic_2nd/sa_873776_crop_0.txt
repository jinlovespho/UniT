gt_text: ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL MEETING UTILITY BUILDING, BILLING PLANNING ROC ZONING CHAN
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text and a VLM OCR output, and I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, let me understand the ground truth text: "ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL MEETING UTILITY BUILDING, BILLING PLANNING ROC ZONING CHAN". The OCR output is "10%".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "10%", which is a percentage. Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth text, considering the specified factors.

The comparison criteria are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, first, I need to process the ground truth text into a set of unique words. Let's break it down:

Original ground truth: "ADMINISTRATION COUNCIL MEETING UTILITY BUILDING, BILLING PLANNING ROC ZONING CHAN"

Breaking this into words, considering that commas and spaces are separators. Let's split by spaces and commas:

- ADMINISTRATION
- COUNCIL
- MEETING
- UTILITY
- BUILDING
- BILLING
- PLANNING
- ROC
- ZONING
- CHAN

Wait, "CHAN" at the end might be a typo. The original text says "ZONING CHAN"—maybe it's supposed to be "ZONING CHANGES" or something else, but as per the given text, it's "CHAN". However, the problem states to consider small typos as matches, but here the OCR output is "10%", which is entirely different.

Now, the OCR output is "10%". Let's see if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "10%" which is a number and a percentage symbol. None of the words in the ground truth (like ADMINISTRATION, COUNCIL, etc.) are present in the OCR output. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider possible typos, "10%" doesn't resemble any of the words. For example, "CHAN" might be a typo for "CHANGES" but "10%" isn't close to any of those words.

So, according to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, none do.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But here, zero match.
- Category 3: No words match, or the output is unrelated. Since "10%" is unrelated to the ground truth words, it's category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 72
2. Slightly Correct Num: 24
3. Incorrect Num: 172
