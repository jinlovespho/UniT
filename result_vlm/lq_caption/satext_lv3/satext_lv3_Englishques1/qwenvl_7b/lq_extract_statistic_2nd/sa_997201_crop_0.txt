gt_text: movistar
vlm_output: movistar

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "movistar" and the VLM OCR output is also "movistar". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "movistar", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "movistar". The OCR output also has "movistar", so that's a match. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and have no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue here. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be category 1.
- Category 2 would be if some words matched but not all, but here all do.
- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated text, which isn't the case here.

So the answer should be 1.
