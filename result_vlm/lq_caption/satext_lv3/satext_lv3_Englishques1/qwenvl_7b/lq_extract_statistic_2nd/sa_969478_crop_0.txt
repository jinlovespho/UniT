gt_text: AIRWAYS DE
vlm_output: KOSMOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS DE". The VLM OCR output is "KOSMOS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done as "KOSMOS". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has two words: "AIRWAYS" and "DE". The OCR output has one word: "KOSMOS". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, considering case insensitivity, ignoring spacing, and small typos.

Looking at "AIRWAYS" and "DE" versus "KOSMOS". None of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words. "KOSMOS" doesn't resemble "AIRWAYS" or "DE" even with typos. So, there are no matches. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
