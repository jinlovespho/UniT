Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "40", and the VLM OCR output is "MONTREUX". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MONTREUX", which is a proper noun, the name of a place. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "40", which is a number. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth here is just "40", which is a single word. The OCR output is "MONTREUX", which is another single word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "40" is a number, and "MONTREUX" is a word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "40". The OCR output has "MONTREUX". There's no overlap here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Since "40" and "MONTREUX" are completely different, there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3. 

But wait, the instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo; it's a completely different word. So even with typos, there's no way "MONTREUX" can be considered a match for "40". 

So the answer is category 3.
