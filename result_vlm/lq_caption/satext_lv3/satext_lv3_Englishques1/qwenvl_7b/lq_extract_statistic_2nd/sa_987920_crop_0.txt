gt_text: QR AIRFRANCE KLM
vlm_output: S-100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "QR AIRFRANCE KLM" and the VLM OCR output is "S-100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "S-100". Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth, keeping in mind the given criteria.

The ground truth has three unique words: "QR", "AIRFRANCE", and "KLM". The OCR output is "S-100". Let's break it down. 

Looking at the OCR output, "S-100" doesn't seem to contain any of the words from the ground truth. The words in the OCR are "S" and "100", which are numbers and letters, but they don't match "QR", "AIRFRANCE", or "KLM". 

The criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, but since none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even considering different order wouldn't help. Also, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the required words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since "S-100" has no overlap with the ground truth words, the answer should be category 3.
