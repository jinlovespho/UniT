gt_text: GARDERES BRASSERIE
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GARDERES BRASSERIE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which is two words: "Garderes" and "Brasserie". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we have to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is "100%", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since "100%" has no words that are "Garderes" or "Brasserie", even considering typos or case, there's no match. So the category should be 3. The OCR output is completely unrelated to the ground truth text. So the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 210
2. Slightly Correct Num: 101
3. Incorrect Num: 570
