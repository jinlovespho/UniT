gt_text: CENTER MEDICAL
vlm_output: SUNRISE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CENTER MEDICAL" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNRISE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "SUNRISE". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "CENTER" and "MEDICAL". The OCR output is "SUNRISE", which is a single word. 

Now, checking if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. "SUNRISE" doesn't have "CENTER" or "MEDICAL" in it. Even if I consider typos, there's no overlap. The words are completely different. So, according to the categories, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it should be category 3. 

Wait, but what about if there's a typo? For example, if the OCR had "CENter" or something, but here it's "SUNRISE" which is unrelated. So no matches. Therefore, category 3 is the right answer.
