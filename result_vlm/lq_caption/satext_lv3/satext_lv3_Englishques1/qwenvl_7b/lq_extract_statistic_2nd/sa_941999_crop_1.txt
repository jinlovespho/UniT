gt_text: HONDA
vlm_output: HONDA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HONDA" and the VLM OCR output is also "HONDA". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "HONDA".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, we should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is a single word "HONDA", the unique words are just that one.

Now, checking the OCR output. The OCR output is exactly "HONDA", so it matches the ground truth word. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. There are no typos, extra spaces, or missing spaces. So the OCR output is a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. There's no partial match here because all the required words are there. So the answer should be 1.
