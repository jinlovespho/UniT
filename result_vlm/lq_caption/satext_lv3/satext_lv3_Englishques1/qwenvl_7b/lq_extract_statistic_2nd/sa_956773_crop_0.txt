gt_text: BRITISH AIRWAYS
vlm_output: BRITISH AIRWAYS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "BRITISH AIRWAYS" and a VLM OCR output that's exactly the same: "BRITISH AIRWAYS". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "BRITISH AIRWAYS", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, the order is the same.

Next, the comparison needs to consider unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BRITISH" and "AIRWAYS". The OCR output also has these two words. The criteria say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. In this case, both texts are all caps with no punctuation or extra spaces, so they match exactly. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even if there were typos or different order, the category would be 1. Since everything is exact, it's definitely category 1. There's no partial match here, so category 2 or 3 don't apply. The answer should be 1.
