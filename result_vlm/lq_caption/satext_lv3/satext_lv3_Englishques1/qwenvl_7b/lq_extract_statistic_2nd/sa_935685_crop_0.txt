gt_text: Motorin TS 590 EN B7
vlm_output: B7

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Motorin TS 590 EN B7". The OCR output is just "B7". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "B7".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me list the unique words in the ground truth: "Motorin", "TS", "590", "EN", "B7". 

Now, the OCR output is "B7". So, checking which of these unique words are present. "B7" is in both, so that's one match. The other words like "Motorin", "TS", "590", "EN" are not present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words are present (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one but not all match (which is the case here, since only "B7" matches),
3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since there's at least one match (B7) but not all, the category should be 2. Even though the OCR missed most words, the presence of one unique word from the ground truth qualifies it as "partially correct".
