gt_text: CBRE NYC
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CBRE NYC" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CBRE" and "NYC". The OCR output is "100", which is a number.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth words are "CBRE" and "NYC". The OCR output is "100", which doesn't have either of those words. 

Also, need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But "100" is just numbers, so there's no letters here. The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Since "100" has no letters, none of the words from the ground truth are present. So the category should be 3.
