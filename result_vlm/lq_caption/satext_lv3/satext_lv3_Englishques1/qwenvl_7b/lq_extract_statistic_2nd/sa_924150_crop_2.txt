gt_text: FIT
vlm_output: 2014

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FIT" and the VLM OCR output is "2014". The task is to determine the category based on the comparison rules provided.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "2014", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FIT", which are letters. 

Now, moving to Step 2. The comparison needs to consider word order doesn't matter, but we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FIT". The OCR output has "2014", which is a number. 

The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "FIT" is letters and "2014" is numbers. There's no overlap in terms of words here. The OCR output doesn't have any letters, so "FIT" isn't present. Also, typos are considered, but since "2014" isn't even a typo of "FIT" (they are different types of characters), there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "FIT" isn't in "2014" and they are completely different, the category should be 3.
