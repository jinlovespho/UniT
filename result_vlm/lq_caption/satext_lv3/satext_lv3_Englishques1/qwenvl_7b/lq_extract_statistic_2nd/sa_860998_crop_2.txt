gt_text: QUINCAILLERIE
vlm_output: QUINCAILLERIE

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "QUINCAILLERIE" and the VLM OCR output is the same: "QUINCAILLERIE". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "QUINCAILLERIE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

But in this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are the same word. The ground truth has one unique word: "QUINCAILLERIE". The OCR output also has the same word. So when comparing, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though they are the same, it should fall under category 1. 

Wait, but what if there's a typo? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But here there are no typos. The OCR output is exactly correct. So all the unique words (which is just one word here) are present. Therefore, category 1 is correct. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
