gt_text: AIDAstella
vlm_output: AIDA

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIDAstella" and the VLM OCR output is "AIDA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "AIDA". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "AIDAstella". Wait, but the OCR output is "AIDA". 

Wait, the ground truth is a single word, "AIDAstella", right? So the unique words in the ground truth are just that one word. The OCR output is "AIDA". Now, comparing them. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "AIDAstella".

The OCR output has "AIDA". Now, considering that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is missing the "stella" part. So "AIDA" is a substring of "AIDAstella", but is that considered a match? Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. So the OCR output has "AIDA", and the ground truth has "AIDAstella". Are these considered as matching words? Because "AIDA" is part of the ground truth word, but the OCR output is missing the rest. 

But the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, it's not a typo but a truncation. The OCR output is shorter. However, the ground truth is "AIDAstella" and the OCR is "AIDA". If we consider that the OCR output has the beginning part of the ground truth word, but not the entire word, does that count as a match? The problem says that the set of unique words in the ground truth should be considered. Since the OCR output has "AIDA" and the ground truth has "AIDAstella", which are different words. But maybe the OCR output is missing part of the word. However, the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not missing parts of words. 

Wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "AIDAstella". The OCR output has "AIDA". Since "AIDA" is not the same as "AIDAstella", but maybe the OCR output is a partial match. However, the problem says that small typos count as matches. But here, it's not a typo, it's a missing part. So does that count as a match? 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have "AIDA" which is a prefix of the ground truth word. But the instructions don't mention partial matches. They mention that small typos still count, but not missing parts. So if the OCR output is missing part of the word, it's not considered a match. 

Therefore, the OCR output "AIDA" does not include the full "AIDAstella" word. So the set of unique words in the ground truth is {"AIDAstella"}, and the OCR output has {"AIDA"}. Since "AIDA" is not present in the ground truth's unique words (the ground truth has "AIDAstella"), there's no match. Therefore, category 3: Incorrect. But wait, maybe the problem considers that "AIDA" is part of the ground truth word. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. So unless the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth word (allowing for typos, case, spacing), it's not considered a match. 

So in this case, since the OCR output is missing "stella", it's not a match. Therefore, no words match, so category 3. But wait, the user might have intended that the OCR output is a partial match. However, according to the strict instructions, the OCR output must have all unique ground truth words. Since the OCR output is missing part of the word, it's not considered a match. Therefore, category 3.
