gt_text: EY
vlm_output: EY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EY" and the VLM OCR output is also "EY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "EY", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, both are "EY", so order is the same.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EY". The OCR output also has "EY". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation. There's no typo here since they are exactly the same. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Since the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth, it's a full match. 

Therefore, the category should be 1.
