gt_text: 2 2 M
vlm_output: MOTUL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2 2 M" and the VLM OCR output is "MOTUL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "MOTUL". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "2", "2", and "M". But since we're considering unique words, the unique words here are "2" and "M". 

Now, looking at the OCR output "MOTUL", I need to check if any of the unique ground truth words are present. The OCR output has the letters M, O, T, U, L. The word "M" is present in the OCR output. However, the ground truth has "2" as a unique word, which is a number. The OCR output doesn't have any "2" in it. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "2" and "M". The OCR output has "M" but not "2". So, only one of the two unique words matches. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since only "M" matches and "2" doesn't, that's at least one but not all. So the category should be 2. 

But wait, maybe there's a typo? The OCR output is "MOTUL". Could "M" be considered as part of a typo for "2"? The problem says small typos still count as matches. However, "M" and "2" are different characters. Unless there's a scenario where "M" is a typo for "2", but that's not a small typo. Maybe in some fonts, but the instruction says to ignore capitalization and typos. Wait, the instruction says "ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches." So, for example, if the OCR had "2" but it was mistyped as "z", that would still count as a match? Or does "small typos" mean minor ones like "2" vs "z"? Hmm, maybe not. The instruction says "small typos still count as matches." So if the OCR output has a typo that's close to the ground truth word, it's considered a match. But in this case, "M" and "2" are not typos of each other. They are different characters. So "M" is not a typo for "2". Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have "2" at all. So the unique words in ground truth are "2" and "M". The OCR output has "M" but not "2". Therefore, only one of the two unique words is present. So the answer is category 2.
