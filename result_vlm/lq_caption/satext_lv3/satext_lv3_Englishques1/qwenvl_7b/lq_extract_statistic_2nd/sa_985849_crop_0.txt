gt_text: Municipio Palazzo Mosti
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "Municipio Palazzo Mosti" and the OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then, compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: Municipio, Palazzo, Mosti. The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not any of those words.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are in OCR output, 2 if at least one matches but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output is "100" and none of the words from the ground truth are present, even considering typos or case, it doesn't match any. So it's category 3.
