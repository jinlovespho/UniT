gt_text: Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM
vlm_output: 2

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM". The VLM OCR output is just "2". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just the number 2. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has several words: Platform, Lumpur, Kuala, 2, SKTM. The OCR output only has "2". 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output only has "2", which is one of the words in the ground truth. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are Platform, Lumpur, Kuala, 2, SKTM. The OCR output has only "2", which is a match. However, the other words are missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since only one word matches, it's category 2—partially correct. Even though the output is minimal, it's not empty and has at least one correct word. So the answer should be 2.
