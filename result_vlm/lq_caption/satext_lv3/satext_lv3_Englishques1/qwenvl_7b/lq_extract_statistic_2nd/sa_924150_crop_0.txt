gt_text: New 2015 All
vlm_output: FIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "New 2015 All" and the VLM OCR output is "FIT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "FIT".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "New", "2015", and "All". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words appear in the OCR output. The OCR output is "FIT", which is a single word. Let's see if "FIT" matches any of the ground truth words when considering case, typos, etc. 

Looking at the ground truth words:
- "New" vs "FIT": No match. Even if case is ignored, "new" vs "fit" are different.
- "2015" vs "FIT": Definitely no match. Numbers vs letters.
- "All" vs "FIT": Again, no match. "All" and "FIT" are different words.

So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "FIT", which isn't related to any of the expected words. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Not the case here.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But here, none match.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "FIT" doesn't match any of the ground truth words and seems unrelated, this falls under category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
