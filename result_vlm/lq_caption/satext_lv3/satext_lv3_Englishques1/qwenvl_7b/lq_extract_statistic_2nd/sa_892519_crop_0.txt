gt_text: DIDZIOJI 17
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DIDZIOJI 17" and the OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100%". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "DIDZIOJI" and "17". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the order. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "DIDZIOJI" and "17". The OCR output is "100%", which is a single word. 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has "100%", which is a percentage. The ground truth has "17", which is a number. The OCR output doesn't have "DIDZIOJI" or "17" in it. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has "100%", which is a number but not "17", and no mention of "DIDZIOJI", there are no matches. So it's category 3.
