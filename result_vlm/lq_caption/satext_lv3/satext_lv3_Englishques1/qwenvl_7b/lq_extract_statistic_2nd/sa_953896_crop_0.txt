gt_text: DELTA CONNECTION DELTA
vlm_output: Delta

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DELTA CONNECTION DELTA", and the VLM OCR output is "Delta". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Delta". Then, I compare it with the ground truth. 

The ground truth has two unique words: "DELTA" and "CONNECTION". But the OCR output only has "Delta". Now, considering the rules given: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on unique words from the ground truth. Also, we ignore capitalization, so "Delta" matches "DELTA". However, "CONNECTION" is missing from the OCR output. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here, only one of the two is present),
2 if at least one but not all match (which is the case here),
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

So, since "Delta" matches "DELTA" but "CONNECTION" isn't there, it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 177
2. Slightly Correct Num: 87
3. Incorrect Num: 480
