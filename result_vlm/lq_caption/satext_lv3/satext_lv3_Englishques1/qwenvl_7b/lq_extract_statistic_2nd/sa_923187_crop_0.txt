gt_text: Cannabis
vlm_output: Cannabis

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "Cannabis" and the VLM OCR output is also "Cannabis". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Cannabis", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Cannabis". The OCR output has the same word. 

I should check if there are any differences in capitalization, but both start with a capital 'C' and the rest are lowercase. There's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, there's no typo here since they're identical. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
