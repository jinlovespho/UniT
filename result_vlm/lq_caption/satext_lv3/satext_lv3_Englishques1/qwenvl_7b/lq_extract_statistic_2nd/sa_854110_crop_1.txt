Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ALEXELA" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALEXELA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "ALEXELA", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But wait, both are single words here. The ground truth has "ALEXELA" and the OCR output is the same. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "ALEXELA". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization. Both are uppercase, so no issue there. Punctuation and spaces—there's no punctuation or spaces here. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but in this case, there's no typo. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
