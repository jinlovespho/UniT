gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BUT".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT". The OCR output also has "BUT". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
