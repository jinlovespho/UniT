gt_text: FABBRI PIAZZETTA
vlm_output: 1048

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "FABBRI PIAZZETTA" and the VLM OCR output is "1048". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1048". Now, the ground truth has two words: "FABBRI" and "PIAZZETTA". The OCR output is a number, not any of those words. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output here is "1048", which is a number. Neither "1048" is a word that's present in the ground truth. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But since the OCR output is a number, there's no words to compare. The ground truth words are "FABBRI" and "PIAZZETTA", which are proper nouns, likely names. The OCR output is a number, which is unrelated. 

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no words in the OCR output that could be typos of the ground truth words. The number 1048 doesn't resemble either of the two words. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one matches, but not all. But since there's no matches, it's not even partially correct. Category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.
