gt_text: G-275
vlm_output: Airbus

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "G-275" and the VLM OCR output is "Airbus". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Airbus", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has "G-275". Let's break down the comparison based on the given criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is a single word: "G-275". The OCR output is "Airbus", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "G-275" has a hyphen and numbers, while "Airbus" is a proper noun with no hyphens or numbers. There's no overlap in the words here. Even if we consider typos, "Airbus" doesn't resemble "G-275" in any way. 

Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output doesn't contain that word, even after considering the rules, there are no matches. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3 because there are no matches or the output is unrelated.
