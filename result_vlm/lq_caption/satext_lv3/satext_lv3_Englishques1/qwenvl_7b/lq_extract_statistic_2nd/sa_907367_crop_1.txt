gt_text: GR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GR" and the VLM OCR output is also "GR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "GR", so that's straightforward. The ground truth is the same, "GR".

Now Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

First, let's break down the ground truth. The ground truth is "GR". Since it's two letters, maybe they're considered as two separate words? Wait, but the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". Wait, "GR" as a single word or two letters? Hmm. The example given might be a single word, but maybe in this context, "GR" is considered as two characters, but the instructions mention words. Wait, but "GR" could be an abbreviation, like "Grand Rapids" or something, but here it's just "GR".

But the key is that the ground truth is "GR" and the OCR output is "GR". So the unique words in the ground truth would be ["GR"], since it's a single word. The OCR output is also "GR", so the set of unique words is the same. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, that's a match. Even if there were typos, but here there are none. So the answer should be 1.

Wait, but what if the OCR output had a typo like "gR" or "Gr"? The instructions say small typos still count as matches. But here, it's exactly the same. So definitely, all unique words (just "GR") are present. So category 1.
