gt_text: SPORTAGE
vlm_output: SPORTAGE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPORTAGE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SPORTAGE". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer must be 1.
