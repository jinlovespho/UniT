gt_text: COTTAGE MINT
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "COTTAGE MINT" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "COTTAGE" and "MINT". 

But the OCR output is "100", which is a number, not the words. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words from the ground truth. So, do numbers count as words here? The ground truth has words, and the OCR output has a number. Since "100" isn't a word that matches either "COTTAGE" or "MINT", even considering typos, it doesn't seem like there's any match. 

Also, the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since "100" doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth, even ignoring case or spacing, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. So the answer should be 3.
