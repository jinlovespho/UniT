gt_text: DA
vlm_output: 2014

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "DA", and the VLM OCR output is "2014". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "2014".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "DA". Wait, but "DA" is a single word here. The OCR output is "2014", which is a number. 

Now, the comparison criteria: check if the OCR output contains all unique words from the ground truth. But "DA" isn't in "2014". There's no overlap. Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "DA" is uppercase, and "2014" is numbers. There's no typo here because "2014" isn't a typo of "DA"; they're entirely different. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth ("DA") are present in the OCR output, it would fall under category 3: Incorrect. Even though the OCR output isn't empty, it's unrelated to the ground truth. The output is a year, while the ground truth is likely an abbreviation. No matches here.
