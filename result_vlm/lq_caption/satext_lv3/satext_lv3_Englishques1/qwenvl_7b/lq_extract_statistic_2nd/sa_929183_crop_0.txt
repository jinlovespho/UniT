gt_text: EQUINOX 3567
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EQUINOX 3567" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "10%". 

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "EQUINOX" and "3567". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output, considering the specified factors: ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. The OCR output is "10%", which is a percentage. Let's break it down. 

The ground truth words are "EQUINOX" and "3567". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. The number 10 doesn't match 3567, and there's no mention of "EQUINOX" in the OCR output. The percentage symbol isn't part of the ground truth words either. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain either of the unique words from the ground truth, even when considering possible typos or ignoring case, it seems like there's no match. The only number present is 10, which is different from 3567, and there's no word related to "EQUINOX". 

Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3—Incorrect.
