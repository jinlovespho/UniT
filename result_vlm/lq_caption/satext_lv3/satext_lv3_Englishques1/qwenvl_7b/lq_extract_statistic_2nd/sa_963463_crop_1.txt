gt_text: TOWERBANK
vlm_output: TOWERBANK

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOWERBANK" and the VLM OCR output is also "TOWERBANK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "TOWERBANK", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "TOWERBANK". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since both are the same word, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it should be category 1.
