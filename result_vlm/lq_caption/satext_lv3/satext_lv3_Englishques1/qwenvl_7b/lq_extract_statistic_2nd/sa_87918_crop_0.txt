Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZRINSKI" and the VLM OCR output is "ZPRINSKI". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to understand the instructions properly. The key points are:

- Compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The categories are:
1. Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2. Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3. Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

So, the ground truth is "ZRINSKI". Let's note that this is a single word. The OCR output is "ZPRINSKI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "ZPRINSKI". Then, compare it to the ground truth. 

Since both are single words, let's break them down. The ground truth is "ZRINSKI" and the OCR output is "ZPRINSKI". Let's check the letters:

ZRINSKI vs ZPRINSKI.

Looking at the letters, the first letter is Z in both. The second letter in the ground truth is R, but in the OCR output, it's P. Then the rest of the letters: I, N, S, K, I. So the OCR output has "ZPRINSKI" versus "ZRINSKI".

The main difference is the second letter: R vs P. Now, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. So, even if there's a typo, like P instead of R, it's considered a match. However, the question is whether the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

But since the ground truth is a single word, "ZRINSKI", and the OCR output is "ZPRINSKI", which is a variation with a typo. The instruction says that small typos still count as matches. Therefore, even though there's a typo (P instead of R), it's considered a match. 

Therefore, the unique word in the ground truth is "ZRINSKI", and the OCR output has "ZPRINSKI", which is a typo but counts as a match. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (which is just one) are present in the OCR output. Hence, category 1.

Wait, but maybe I need to check if the OCR output has the same set of unique words as the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ZRINSKI". The OCR output has "ZPRINSKI". Are these considered the same word with a typo? Since the instructions say small typos count as matches, then yes. Therefore, the OCR output contains the correct word with a typo, which is considered a match. So category 1.

But wait, the problem says "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has the set {ZRINSKI}, and the OCR output has the set {ZPRINSKI}. Since ZPRINSKI is considered a match (due to small typos), then the set of unique words in the OCR output includes the correct word (with a typo, but still considered a match). Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, so category 1.

Therefore, the answer is 1.
