gt_text: this morning
vlm_output: his morning

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "this morning" and the VLM OCR output is "his morning". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "his morning", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "this" and "morning". 

Now, checking the OCR output: "his" and "morning". The word "morning" is a perfect match. The word "his" is a typo compared to "this". The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. So "his" would be considered a match for "this" because it's a minor typo (missing the 't').

Since both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (even with the typo), according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this should be category 1. 

I don't see any other words in the OCR output that aren't in the ground truth, and there's no missing words. Even though "his" is a typo, it's still considered a match. So the answer should be 1.
