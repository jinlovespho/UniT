gt_text: September- plein 18 Emmasingel
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "September- plein 18 Emmasingel". The VLM OCR output is "100".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: September, plein, 18, Emmasingel. Wait, but the hyphen after September might be part of the word? Or is it a separator? The original text is "September- plein 18 Emmasingel". So maybe "September-" is a word? Or is it "September" and "plein" as separate words? Let me check the original ground truth again. The user wrote "September- plein 18 Emmasingel". The hyphen is right after September, then a space, then "plein", etc. So maybe the words are "September-", "plein", "18", "Emmasingel". But the hyphen might be a typo or part of the actual text. However, the user's instruction says to ignore punctuation, so hyphens can be ignored. So the unique words in the ground truth would be "September", "plein", "18", "Emmasingel" (ignoring hyphens and punctuation, and case).

Now, the OCR output is "100". So the extracted text is "100". Let's see if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100", which is a number. The ground truth has "18" as a number. So "18" is part of the ground truth. But the OCR output has "100", which is different from "18". Are there any other words? The OCR output is just "100", which is a single number. So the only possible match is the number "18" vs "100". But "100" is not "18", so no match. Also, the other words in the ground truth are "September", "plein", "Emmasingel", which are not present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. So it's category 3: Incorrect. Because the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. The OCR output is a number that doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
