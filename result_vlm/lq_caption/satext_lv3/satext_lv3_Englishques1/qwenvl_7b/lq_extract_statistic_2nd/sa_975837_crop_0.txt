gt_text: Buvette Bateau
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Buvette Bateau", and the OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Buvette" and "Bateau". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the order. But I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number, not the words "Buvette" or "Bateau". 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100%" is a number with a percentage sign, which is different from the words in the ground truth. There's no mention of numbers in the ground truth, so this might not match.

Small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output isn't even close to the words. The words "Buvette" and "Bateau" aren't present in any form in "100%". So, there are no matches. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
