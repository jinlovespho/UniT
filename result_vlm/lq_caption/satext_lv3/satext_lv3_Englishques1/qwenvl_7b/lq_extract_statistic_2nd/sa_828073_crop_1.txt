Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "DALIAN".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth has the word "DALIAN". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor typos, it would still count as a match. But here, there's no typo. The words are the same, and since we're considering unique words from the ground truth, which is just "DALIAN", and the OCR output contains that exact word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word), the category should be 1. There's no issue with order, case, or spacing because they are the same. So the answer is 1.
