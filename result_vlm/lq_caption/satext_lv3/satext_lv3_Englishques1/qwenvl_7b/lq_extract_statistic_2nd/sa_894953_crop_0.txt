gt_text: 52093 mobile
vlm_output: 52093

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "52093 mobile" and the VLM OCR output is "52093". So, step one is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "52093". Then, comparing that to the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two words: "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has only "52093". So, the unique words in the ground truth are "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has "52093" but not "mobile". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are present. Here, only one of the two words is present. So it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since "52093" is present, that's one match. The other word "mobile" is missing. So that's category 2. Category 3 is if no words match or it's unrelated. But here, one word does match, so not category 3. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "mobile" which isn't in the OCR output. The OCR output has only the number. So the unique words in ground truth are "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has "52093" but not "mobile". So only one of the two words is present. Therefore, it's partially correct, category 2.
