gt_text: HEAD
vlm_output: HEAD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HEAD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HEAD". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "HEAD".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly "HEAD".

The unique words in the ground truth are just one word: "HEAD". The OCR output also has "HEAD". Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces are ignored, but there's none in this case. Small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here.

So since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "HEAD"), it should be category 1. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches exactly. Even if there were a typo, like "HEAd", it would still count as a match. But here, it's perfect. So the answer is 1.
