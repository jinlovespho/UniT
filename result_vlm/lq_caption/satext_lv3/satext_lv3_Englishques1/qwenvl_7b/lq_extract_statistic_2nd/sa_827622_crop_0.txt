gt_text: BRAZZERS
vlm_output: BRAZZERS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "BRAZZERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "BRAZZERS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BRAZZERS". The OCR output also has "BRAZZERS". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though there's only one word, it should fall under category 1. The answer should be 1.
