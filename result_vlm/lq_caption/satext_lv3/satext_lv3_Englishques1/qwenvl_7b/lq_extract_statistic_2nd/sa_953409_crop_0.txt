gt_text: HOTEL HOTEL
vlm_output: HOTEL

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOTEL HOTEL", and the VLM OCR output is "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "HOTEL", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The ground truth has the words "HOTEL" and "HOTEL" again, but since we're considering unique words, it's just "HOTEL" once. The OCR output has "HOTEL" once. 

Now, checking the conditions: the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are {"HOTEL"}, and the OCR output's unique words are also {"HOTEL"}. 

Ignoring capitalization and spacing, both are all caps and no extra spaces. There are no typos here since both are exactly "HOTEL". 

So, according to the categories, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the OCR has one instance and the ground truth has two, the category should be 1 — Correct. Because the unique words match, even if the count differs. The problem states to compare based on the set of unique words, not the count. So even though the ground truth has two "HOTEL"s, the OCR has one, but since it's the same word, it's considered a correct match.
