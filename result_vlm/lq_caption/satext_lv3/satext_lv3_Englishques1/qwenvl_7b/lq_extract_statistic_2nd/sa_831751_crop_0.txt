Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DAK" and the VLM OCR output is also "DAK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "DAK".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DAK". The OCR output also has "DAK". 

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not an issue.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has only "DAK" and the OCR output has that exact word, it's a perfect match. So this should be category 1. There's no possibility of it being category 2 or 3 here because all conditions are met.
