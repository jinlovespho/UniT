gt_text: D&G
vlm_output: D&G

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "D&G" and the VLM OCR output is also "D&G". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "D&G", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has the word "D&G". The OCR output is exactly the same. So, the unique words in ground truth are just "D&G". The OCR output has the same word. Even if there were typos, like maybe "D&g" or "D and G", but in this case, it's exactly the same. So all unique words from ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

So according to category 1, that's correct. Since the OCR output matches exactly, even though the steps mention ignoring some things, but here there's no difference. So the answer should be category 1.
