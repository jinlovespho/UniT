gt_text: Marshall
vlm_output: Marshall

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Marshall" and the VLM OCR output is also "Marshall". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Marshall", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, there's only one word in both the ground truth and the OCR output, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Marshall".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output and ground truth are both exactly "Marshall", so capitalization is the same (both start with uppercase M), and there's no punctuation or spaces to consider.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are "Marshall", the set of unique words matches perfectly. So this should be category 1.

Wait, but the problem mentions "unique words in the ground truth". The ground truth is "Marshall", which is one unique word. The OCR output is also "Marshall", which is the same. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it's category 1.

I don't see any discrepancies here. Even if there were a typo, like "Marshell", it would still count as a match because of the typo tolerance. But in this case, it's exact. So the answer should be 1.
