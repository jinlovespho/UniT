gt_text: NIS A-1 13 No JET GAZPROM NEFT
vlm_output: NIS

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NIS A-1 13 No JET GAZPROM NEFT" and the VLM OCR output is just "NIS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "NIS". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. Let's list out the unique words from the ground truth: NIS, A-1, 13, No, JET, GAZPROM, NEFT. 

Now, the OCR output has "NIS", which is one of the unique words. The other words in the ground truth (A-1, 13, No, JET, GAZPROM, NEFT) are not present in the OCR output. 

The categories are based on how many unique words match. Since only "NIS" matches, and there are six other unique words that don't, this would be a partial match. The category 2 is for "partially correct" where at least one but not all words match. 

I should also check if there's any possibility of typos or other factors, but the OCR output is just "NIS" which exactly matches one of the ground truth words. So, no typos here. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
