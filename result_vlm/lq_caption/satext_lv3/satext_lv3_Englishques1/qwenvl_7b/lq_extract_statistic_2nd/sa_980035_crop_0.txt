gt_text: RANCH THE HOUSE
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RANCH THE HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing that to the ground truth words: "RANCH", "THE", "HOUSE".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three unique words: RANCH, THE, HOUSE. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number with a percent sign. 

Now, checking if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "10%" which is a number and a symbol. None of the words RANCH, THE, or HOUSE are present here. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are in OCR (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one but not all match (but there are zero matches here),
3 if no words match or output is unrelated.

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, the category should be 3. Also, the OCR output is unrelated (a percentage vs. words about a house). So the answer is 3.
