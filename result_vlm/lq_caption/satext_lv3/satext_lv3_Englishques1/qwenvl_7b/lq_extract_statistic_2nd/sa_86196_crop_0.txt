gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: CROWN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "CROWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "CROWN". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "CROWN", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word. 

They also say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CROWN". The OCR output also has "CROWN". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth (just "CROWN") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's a Category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
