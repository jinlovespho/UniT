gt_text: PARKING RESERVED 142 E
vlm_output: 142 E

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PARKING RESERVED 142 E" and the VLM OCR output is "142 E". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "142 E". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. The unique words in the ground truth are "PARKING", "RESERVED", "142", "E". The OCR output has "142" and "E". 

So, checking each unique word from the ground truth: "PARKING" and "RESERVED" are not present in the OCR output. The OCR has "142" and "E", which are part of the ground truth. But since the ground truth has two words that aren't in the OCR output, but the OCR has two that are present. However, the categories are based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. 

Wait, the category 1 says all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. The OCR output here is missing "PARKING" and "RESERVED". So even though "142" and "E" are present, since not all unique words are there, it's not category 1. But category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Here, two of the four words match. So that's at least one, but not all. So it would be category 2. But wait, the OCR output only has two words, but the ground truth has four. So the OCR is missing two words. So according to the criteria, since at least one (actually two) match, but not all (four), it's category 2. 

But wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has four words: PARKING, RESERVED, 142, E. The OCR output has 142 and E. So two matches. So that's at least one, but not all. So category 2. 

But maybe I should check if the OCR output has any of the words. Since "142" and "E" are present, which are part of the ground truth. So the answer would be category 2.
