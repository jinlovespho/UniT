gt_text: STREET EBURY SW1 CITY OF WESTMINSTER
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "STREET EBURY SW1 CITY OF WESTMINSTER" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", which is a percentage. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth text. The unique words here are: STREET, EBURY, SW1, CITY, OF, WESTMINSTER. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percent sign. 

Now, comparing the two. The OCR output has no words that are present in the ground truth. Even if I consider "100%" as a number, none of the words in the ground truth match. The ground truth includes place names and a postcode (SW1), but the OCR output is just a percentage. There's no overlap in terms of words. 

Considering the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Clearly, that's not the case here. Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But there's no matching word. So it's Category 3: Incorrect, because none of the words match, and the output is unrelated. The OCR output is entirely different and doesn't contain any of the expected words. So the answer should be 3.
