gt_text: judith charles
vlm_output: 100

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "judith charles" and the VLM OCR output is "100". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is a string of numbers. The ground truth has two words: "judith" and "charles". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "judith" and "charles". The OCR output has "100", which are numbers, not words. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "100" is a number, not a word. The ground truth words are names, which are alphabetic. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, "100" doesn't resemble "judith" or "charles" in any way. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one but not all match (but there are no matches here),
3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Since "100" has no relation to the words "judith" or "charles", it's category 3.
