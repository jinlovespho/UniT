Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FURLA" and the VLM OCR output is "1024". I need to follow the steps provided to determine the category.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1024", which is just numbers. The ground truth is "FURLA", which is a word, probably a brand name or something. 

Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FURLA". The OCR output has numbers, which are not words. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any letters, just numbers. So there's no overlap in terms of words. The category rules say that if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. If at least one but not all match, it's 2. If none match or it's unrelated, it's 3.

Since the OCR output is "1024", which is numbers and doesn't contain any letters from "FURLA", there's no match. Therefore, it's category 3.
