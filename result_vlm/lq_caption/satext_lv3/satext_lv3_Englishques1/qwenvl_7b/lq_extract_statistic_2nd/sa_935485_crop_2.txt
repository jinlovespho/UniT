Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "11" and the VLM OCR output is also "11". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "11".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since both are "11", the order is the same, but even if it weren't, the comparison would still be okay.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "11" (assuming "11" is considered a single word here). The OCR output also has "11", so the set of unique words matches exactly. 

The other factors to ignore are capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since there's no capitalization or punctuation here, and the spacing is the same (no spaces at all), those don't affect the comparison. Also, there are no typos mentioned, so that's not an issue.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "11" is the only unique word and it's present, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as partially correct or incorrect. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match according to the given criteria.
