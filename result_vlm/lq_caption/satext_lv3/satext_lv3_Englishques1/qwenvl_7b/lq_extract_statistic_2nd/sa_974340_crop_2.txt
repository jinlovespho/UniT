gt_text: 80
vlm_output: WORLDS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "80" and the VLM OCR output is "WORLDS". So I need to compare these two based on the steps given.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "WORLDS", which is all uppercase. Then step 2 says to compare with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "80", which is a number. But the OCR output is "WORLDS", which is a word. 

The categories are 1, 2, or 3. The unique words in the ground truth would be just "80" since it's a single number. The OCR output has "WORLDS" as a single word. Now, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is completely different from the ground truth. The ground truth is a number, and the OCR output is a word. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are ["80"], and the OCR output's unique words are ["WORLDS"]. So none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth's words. Also, the instructions mention that if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3. 

But maybe I should check if "80" could be a typo for "WORLDS"? No, because "80" is a number and "WORLDS" is a word. They don't have any overlapping letters or possible typos. So there's no match here. Therefore, category 3 is correct.
