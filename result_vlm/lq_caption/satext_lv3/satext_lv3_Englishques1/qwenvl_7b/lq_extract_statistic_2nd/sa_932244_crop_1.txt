gt_text: 26 15 15H
vlm_output: POLICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "26 15 15H" and the VLM OCR output is "POLICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "POLICE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the numbers 26, 15, and 15H. The OCR output is "POLICE", which is a word, not numbers. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "26", "15", and "15H". The OCR output has the word "POLICE", which doesn't match any of these. 

Even if I consider typos or ignore case, "POLICE" isn't related to the numbers in the ground truth. Also, the categories state that if no words match, it's category 3. Since there's no overlap between "POLICE" and the ground truth words, the answer should be 3.
