gt_text: ANELLO
vlm_output: ANELLO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ANELLO" and the VLM OCR output is also "ANELLO". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, considering unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ANELLO". The OCR output also has "ANELLO". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos mentioned, so the OCR output matches exactly. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
