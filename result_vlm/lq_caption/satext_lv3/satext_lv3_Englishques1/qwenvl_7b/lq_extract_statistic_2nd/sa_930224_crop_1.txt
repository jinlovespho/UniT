Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EAO HY18" and the VLM OCR output is "NL-1204". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "NL-1204". Then step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. But I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "EAO" and "HY18". 

Wait, but the OCR output is "NL-1204". Let me check if any of these words match. The ground truth words are "EAO" and "HY18". The OCR output has "NL" and "1204". Are there any matches? 

Looking at the words, "EAO" vs "NL" and "HY18" vs "1204". There's no overlap here. The OCR output doesn't have "EAO" or "HY18". Also, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But the ground truth words are "EAO" and "HY18" (assuming they are separate words). The OCR output is "NL-1204", which is two parts separated by a hyphen. But even if I split them into "NL" and "1204", none of these are in the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since there are no matches here, it's category 3. Also, the OCR output is "NL-1204" which seems unrelated to "EAO HY18". So the answer should be 3.
