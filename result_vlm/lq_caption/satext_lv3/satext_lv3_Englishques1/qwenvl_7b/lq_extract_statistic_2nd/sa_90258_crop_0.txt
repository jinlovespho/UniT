gt_text: CINDERELLA VIKING
vlm_output: M/S

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "CINDERELLA VIKING" and the VLM OCR output is "M/S". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "M/S". Let me note that down. Now, the ground truth has two words: "Cinderella" and "Viking". 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, the OCR output has "M/S" which is not even close to the words in the ground truth. 

The instructions mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Cinderella" and "Viking". The OCR output has "M" and "S" as separate words (assuming the slash is a separator here). But "M" and "S" are not related to "Cinderella" or "Viking" in any way. 

Also, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "M/S" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "M" or "S" could be a typo for "Cinderella" or "Viking". Those are completely different words. 

So, according to the categories: 
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But here, none are present.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But again, there are no matches here.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "M/S" has no relation to "Cinderella" or "Viking", this falls under category 3.

I think that's it. The OCR output is completely unrelated, so the answer should be 3.
