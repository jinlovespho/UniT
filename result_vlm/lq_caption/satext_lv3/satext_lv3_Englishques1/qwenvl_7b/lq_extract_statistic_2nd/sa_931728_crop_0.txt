gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UBS" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%". Now, comparing this to the ground truth "UBS". 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one word: "UBS". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol. There's no "UBS" in the OCR output. So, does "10%" have any relation to "UBS"? Not directly. 

Next, checking if there's a possibility of typos. The problem says small typos still count as matches. However, "10%" is a numerical value, while "UBS" is an acronym. They don't seem related by typo. For example, if the OCR had "ubs" or "ubS", that might be considered a typo, but "10%" is a different type of data entirely. 

The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, the OCR output is a number with a percentage, which doesn't match the ground truth's letters. 

Since there are no matching words between "UBS" and "10%", even considering the criteria, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Therefore, according to category 3, which states "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty," this would fall under category 3.
