gt_text: Rai

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rai" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rai". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Rai".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rai". The OCR output also has "Rai". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "Rai") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
