gt_text: NIKE zoomx
vlm_output: NIKE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "NIKE zoomx", and the VLM OCR output is "NIKE". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "NIKE", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules are a bit specific. Let's look at them one by one.

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, the OCR output has only one word, "NIKE", while the ground truth has two words: "NIKE" and "zoomx".

- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR output has only "NIKE".

- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both "NIKE" in the OCR and ground truth are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here.

- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output just misses the second word.

Now, the categories: 

Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR output only has "NIKE", so it's missing "zoomx". Therefore, not all words are present.

Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Here, "NIKE" is present, but "zoomx" isn't. So that's one out of two words. So that would be category 2.

Category 3 is if no words match or it's unrelated. Since "NIKE" does match, it's not category 3.

So the answer should be 2.
