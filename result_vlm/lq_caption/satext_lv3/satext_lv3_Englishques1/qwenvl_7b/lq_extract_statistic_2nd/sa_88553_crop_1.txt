gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Nikon".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are the same in terms of case and spacing.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are identical.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "Nikon" and the ground truth is also "Nikon", this matches perfectly. There's only one unique word, and it's present.

So the answer should be category 1.
