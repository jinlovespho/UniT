gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has the same word. So, the unique words match.

Then, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so that's not an issue here.

Small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos in this case, the OCR output is exactly correct.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both have the same single word, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
