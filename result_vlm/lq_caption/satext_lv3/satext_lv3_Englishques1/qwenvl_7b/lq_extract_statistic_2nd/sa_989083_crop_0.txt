gt_text: AF AF
vlm_output: smile

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AF AF", and the VLM OCR output is "smile". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "smile". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of "AF", but since the instructions say to consider unique words, I should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique word here is "AF".

Now, comparing the OCR output "smile" to the ground truth's unique word "AF". The problem says that word order doesn't matter, but here the OCR output has a different word entirely. Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, "smile" isn't a typo of "AF" at all. They are completely different words. 

Since the ground truth has "AF" and the OCR output has "smile", there's no match. The category definitions say that if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
