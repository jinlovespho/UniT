gt_text: PLM 9H
vlm_output: 9H-PLM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLM 9H" and the VLM OCR output is "9H-PLM". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules provided.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "9H-PLM". The ground truth is "PLM 9H". 

Next, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So, even if the order is different, it's okay. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's see what the unique words are in the ground truth. The ground truth has "PLM" and "9H". Both are unique words here. 

Now, the OCR output is "9H-PLM". The hyphen might be considered punctuation. The rules say to ignore punctuation. So, if we remove the hyphen, we get "9H PLM". Then, ignoring spaces and order, the words are "9H" and "PLM", which are the same as the ground truth. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization. However, in this case, both the ground truth and the OCR output have the same capitalization ("PLM" and "9H" vs. "9H" and "PLM"). So no issues there. 

Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here; the words are exactly the same. 

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, just in a different order and with a hyphen which is ignored. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. 

I don't see any missing words or extra words. The hyphen is considered punctuation and is ignored. So the answer should be category 1.
