gt_text: ROVER
vlm_output: ROVER

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROVER" and the VLM OCR output is also "ROVER". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "ROVER".

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "ROVER" (since it's a single word). The OCR output also has "ROVER". Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Here, both are all caps, but even if they weren't, they would still match. Also, there are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because it's a complete match. No typos, correct capitalization, same word. So the answer should be 1.
