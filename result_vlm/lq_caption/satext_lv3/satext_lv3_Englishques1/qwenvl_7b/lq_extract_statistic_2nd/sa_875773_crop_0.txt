gt_text: KAUPPAKATU
vlm_output: KUJUNDŽILOVA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KAUPPAKATU" and the VLM OCR output is "KUJUNDŽILOVA". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "KUJUNDŽILOVA". So that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

Let me break down the ground truth and OCR output. The ground truth is "KAUPPAKATU". Since there's only one word here, the unique words in the ground truth are just {"KAUPPAKATU"} (case-insensitive, so maybe "kauppakatu" if we consider lowercase, but the OCR output is "KUJUNDŽILOVA").

Now, the OCR output is "KUJUNDŽILOVA". Let's check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth word is "KAUPPAKATU". The OCR output is "KUJUNDŽILOVA". 

Comparing the two words: "KAUPPAKATU" vs "KUJUNDŽILOVA". Let's look for any possible matches. The first letters are K and K, but then they diverge. The ground truth word is "kauppakatu" (Finnish for "shop street"), and the OCR output is "Kujundžilova" which seems like a different name, possibly a surname. 

Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't contain that word (even with typos considered), there's no match. The OCR output is a completely different word. So according to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. Here, none do.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. Since there's only one, and it's not present, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. This fits because the OCR output is a different word, not matching the ground truth.

So the answer should be category 3.
