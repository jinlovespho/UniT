gt_text: Wolt
vlm_output: Wolt

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Wolt" and the VLM OCR output is also "Wolt". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Wolt", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Wolt".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Both have the same word "Wolt". The unique words in the ground truth are just "Wolt". The OCR output also has "Wolt". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring order (but there's only one word here), case (both are uppercase W and lowercase olt?), wait, the ground truth is "Wolt" and the OCR is "Wolt". Wait, the original text says "Wolt" for both. Wait, the user wrote:

Ground truth text: "Wolt"
VLM OCR output: "Wolt"

So both are exactly the same. So the OCR output is exactly matching the ground truth. So according to the categories:

Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "Wolt", and the OCR output has that same word. So it's a perfect match. 

Even though the steps mention considering typos, but in this case, there are no typos. So the answer should be category 1.
