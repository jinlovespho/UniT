gt_text: INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only consider the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches. 

Looking at the ground truth, the unique words are "INTERNATIONAL", "CORPORATION", and "SERVICE". The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not any of these words. 

Now, checking the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "100" doesn't contain any of those words, this isn't the case.
- Category 2 is for partially correct, where at least one word matches. But "100" doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. 
- Category 3 is for incorrect, which applies here because there are no matches and the output is unrelated.

So, the answer should be category 3.
