gt_text: 2,2 M
vlm_output: no parking

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2,2 M" and the VLM OCR output is "no parking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "no parking".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "2,2" and "M". But the OCR output has "no" and "parking". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "2,2" and "M". The OCR output's unique words are "no" and "parking". 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. The ground truth has numbers and a letter, while the OCR output has words that don't seem related. There's no overlap in the words. Even considering typos, the OCR output words are entirely different. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3—Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words from the ground truth.
