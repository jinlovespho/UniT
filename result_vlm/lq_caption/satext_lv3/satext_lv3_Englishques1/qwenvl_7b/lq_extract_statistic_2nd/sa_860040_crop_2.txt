gt_text: 861 11940
vlm_output: AMBULANCE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "861 11940" and the VLM OCR output is "AMBULANCE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "AMBULANCE". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two numbers: 861 and 11940. The OCR output is a word, "AMBULANCE".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth here is numbers, not words. Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth is "861 11940" which are numbers. Are numbers considered words here?

Hmm, the categories are about whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words (assuming numbers are considered words here), but the OCR output is "AMBULANCE", which is a different word. So there's no overlap. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc., but the ground truth is numbers and the OCR output is a word. There's no match in terms of words. So according to the categories, since none of the unique words from the ground truth (861, 11940) are present in the OCR output, it would be category 3: Incorrect. 

Even if we consider typos, but "AMBULANCE" isn't a typo of the numbers. It's a completely different word. So no matches. Therefore, the answer is 3.
