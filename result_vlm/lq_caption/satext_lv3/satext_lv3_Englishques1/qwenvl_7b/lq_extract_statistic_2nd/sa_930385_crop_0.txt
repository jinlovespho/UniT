gt_text: GardenCafe
vlm_output: London Eye

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GardenCafe" and the VLM OCR output is "London Eye". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "London Eye", which are two words. 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "GardenCafe", which is one word. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "GardenCafe".

Now, checking if any of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth. The OCR output has "London" and "Eye". Neither of these are related to "GardenCafe". Even if we consider typos or ignore case, "London" and "Eye" don't match "GardenCafe" in any way. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one matches (but there's none),
3 if no words match or it's unrelated. 

Since there are no matching words, the category should be 3.
