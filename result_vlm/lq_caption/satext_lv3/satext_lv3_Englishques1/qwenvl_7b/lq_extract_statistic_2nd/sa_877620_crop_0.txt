gt_text: ZONE NO FLY
vlm_output: NO FLY ZONE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "ZONE NO FLY" and the OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". The user wants me to compare these based on the steps provided.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should check if all the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos.

The ground truth has three words: "ZONE", "NO", and "FLY". The OCR output has "NO", "FLY", and "ZONE". Even though the order is different, all the words are there. Also, the case is different (like "ZONE" vs "zone"), but the instructions say to ignore capitalization. So each word in the ground truth is present in the OCR output. There are no typos mentioned here, so it's a perfect match. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
