gt_text: Jobs
vlm_output: Jobs

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Jobs" and the VLM OCR output is also "Jobs". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Jobs".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Jobs". The OCR output is the same word. So when comparing, even if there were typos, like "Job" or "Jobbs", it would still count as a match. But here, it's exactly the same. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a full match. So the answer should be category 1.
