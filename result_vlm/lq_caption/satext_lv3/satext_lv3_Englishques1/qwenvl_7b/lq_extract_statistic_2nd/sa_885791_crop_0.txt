Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "2". The OCR output has "100%". Now, according to the instructions, I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "2". 

Now, checking if "2" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output is "100%", which includes the number 1, 0, 0, and the percentage symbol. There's no "2" in there. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "100%" doesn't have a "2" at all. So even with typos, there's no "2" present. 

Also, considering that word order doesn't matter, but since the ground truth is a single word, the OCR output needs to have that exact word or a typo of it. Since "100%" doesn't contain "2", there's no match. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect.
