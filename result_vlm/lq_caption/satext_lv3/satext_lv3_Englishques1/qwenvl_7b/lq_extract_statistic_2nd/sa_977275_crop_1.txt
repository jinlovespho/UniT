gt_text: OXYGEN
vlm_output: OXYGEN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OXYGEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "OXYGEN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "OXYGEN".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OXYGEN". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are uppercase, same spelling. No typos mentioned here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, the answer should be category 1.
