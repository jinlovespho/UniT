gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "LIBERTE". First, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "LIBERTE", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both texts are exactly the same word. 

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LIBERTE". The OCR output also has "LIBERTE". 

The guidelines say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, both are all caps with no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "LIBERTE" is present in both, and there's only one unique word, this should be a Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches exactly, so it's a full match. No need to consider partial matches or incorrect categories. The answer should be 1.
