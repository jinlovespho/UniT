gt_text: BEER
vlm_output: BEER

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEER" and the VLM OCR output is also "BEER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "BEER", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are exactly "BEER".

Next, they mention comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BEER". The OCR output also has "BEER". So the unique words match.

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are all caps and no spaces, so that's not an issue. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the category should be 1.
