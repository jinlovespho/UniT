gt_text: HOTEL MUSEUM
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to read any text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOTEL MUSEUM". The VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to read any text." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence: "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "read", "any", "text."

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "HOTEL" and "MUSEUM". The OCR output doesn't have either of these words. All the words in the OCR output are different from the ground truth words. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking for unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output has none of those words. Even if there were typos, like "hotle" instead of "hotel", but in this case, there's no match at all. 

So, according to the categories, since no words match, it falls under category 3 — Incorrect.
