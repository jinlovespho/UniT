gt_text: Midea
vlm_output: Midea

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Midea" and the VLM OCR output is also "Midea". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Midea", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Midea". The OCR output also has "Midea". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
