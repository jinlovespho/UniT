gt_text: EXIT
vlm_output: 1

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EXIT" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "EXIT".

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "EXIT". The OCR output is "1". Let's see if "1" can be considered a match for "EXIT". The problem says small typos still count as matches, but "1" is a number, not a letter. "EXIT" is a four-letter word. There's no mention of numbers being considered as letters here. So "1" doesn't look like a typo for "EXIT"; it's a completely different character. 

Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "EXIT" or any variation that could be considered a match (even with typos), there are no matching words. The categories state that if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
