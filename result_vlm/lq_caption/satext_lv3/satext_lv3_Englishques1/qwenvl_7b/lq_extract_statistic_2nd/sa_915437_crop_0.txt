gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: Duty

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Duty" and the VLM OCR output is also "Duty". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Duty", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Duty".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both have only one word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Duty". The OCR output also has "Duty". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. Because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, considering the given factors.
