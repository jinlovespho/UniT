gt_text: SHACK
vlm_output: SHACK

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHACK" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHACK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "SHACK", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "SHACK".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has one unique word: "SHACK". The OCR output is exactly the same. So, when comparing, since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. So all unique ground truth words (just "SHACK") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
