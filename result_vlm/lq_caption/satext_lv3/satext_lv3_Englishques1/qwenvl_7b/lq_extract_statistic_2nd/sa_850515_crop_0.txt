gt_text: APA
vlm_output: The image provided does not contain any visible English text. It appears to be a low-resolution image of a building with a sky background, but there are no discernible words or text within the image itself.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a ground truth text "APA" and a VLM OCR output that says the image doesn't have any visible English text. The task is to determine the category based on the steps given.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence stating there's no text in the image. So the extracted text would be that entire sentence. But the ground truth is "APA", which is an acronym, probably standing for something like American Psychological Association.

Now, step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. But the OCR output doesn't have any words that are in the ground truth. The ground truth is "APA", which is three letters. The OCR output mentions "English text", "building", "sky background", etc. None of those words are "APA" or any variation of it. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words from ground truth are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth (which is just "APA"), there's no match. Also, the OCR output is saying there's no text, which might be a case where the model is wrong, but according to the instructions, we need to check if the OCR output contains the ground truth words. Since "APA" isn't present, the category would be 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't have any of the words. Even if there were typos, but here there's no mention of "APA" at all. So the answer should be 3.
