gt_text: Welcome
vlm_output: 1972

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Welcome" and the VLM OCR output is "1972". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1972", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "Welcome". 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but we need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Welcome". The OCR output is "1972", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words are present in OCR output.
2 — Partially correct: At least one but not all match.
3 — Incorrect: No words match, or output is unrelated.

Since "Welcome" is a word and "1972" is a number, they don't match. There's no overlap in the set of words. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "Welcome" or any of its variations (like ignoring case, but "Welcome" is a proper noun here). Also, typos aren't applicable here because the OCR output isn't even a word. So, the OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any of the ground truth words. Therefore, it falls under category 3.
