gt_text: AIA CCB

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AIA CCB" and the VLM OCR output is "AIA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "AIA".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "AIA" and "CCB". The OCR output has only "AIA". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. We need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, which are "AIA" and "CCB". The OCR output has "AIA" but not "CCB". 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since "CCB" is missing, that's not met. Category 2 is for at least one but not all. Here, one word ("AIA") matches, so that fits. Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated, which isn't the case here. 

Also, the problem mentions ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But in this case, the OCR output is exactly "AIA", which matches the case of the ground truth's "AIA". No typos are present here. So, the only missing part is "CCB". 

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
