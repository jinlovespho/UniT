Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "in".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are just "in".

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and there's no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both are "in", that's exactly the case here. So the answer should be 1.
