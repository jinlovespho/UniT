gt_text: 110 112
vlm_output: SUNOCO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "110 112" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNOCO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SUNOCO", which is a proper noun, likely a brand name. Now, the ground truth is two numbers: 110 and 112. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "110" and "112". 

But the OCR output is "SUNOCO", which is a single word. Now, considering that we need to check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. However, "SUNOCO" doesn't contain "110" or "112". There's no overlap in the words. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just a complete mismatch. 

Since the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth words, even when ignoring case, spacing, etc., the category should be 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required numbers.
