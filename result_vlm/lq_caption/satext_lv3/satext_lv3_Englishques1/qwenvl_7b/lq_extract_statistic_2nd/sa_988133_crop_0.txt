gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: UIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "UIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "UIT". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "UIT", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are exactly the same: "UIT" vs. "UIT".

Now, looking at the comparison criteria: we need to check if all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word, "UIT". The OCR output also has "UIT". Since they are the same, even considering case, spacing, and typos (though there are none here), all unique words match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, and 3 if none. Since all match here, the answer should be category 1.
