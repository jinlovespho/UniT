gt_text: TOKYO
vlm_output: TOKYO

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOKYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "TOKYO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "TOKYO".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TOKYO". The OCR output also has "TOKYO". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no spaces. So that's a match. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So according to the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since both are exactly the same, all words (just one here) match. So the answer should be 1.
