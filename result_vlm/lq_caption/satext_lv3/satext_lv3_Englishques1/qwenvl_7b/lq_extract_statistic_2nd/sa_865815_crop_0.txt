gt_text: REBOQUE SUJEITOS EXCLUSIVA VIA VEICULOS MULTA AUTOMOTORES VLT DO E A DO VLT
vlm_output: NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. They want me to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on how well it matches the ground truth text.

So, the ground truth text is: "REBOQUE SUJEITOS EXCLUSIVA VIA VEICULOS MULTA AUTOMOTORES VLT DO E A DO VLT". The OCR output is: "NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO".

The steps are: first, extract the text from the OCR output, which is already done here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches. The categories are 1 (all words match), 2 (some match), or 3 (none or mostly wrong).

First, I need to process both texts. Let's start by normalizing them. For the ground truth, I'll split into words, make them lowercase, remove any punctuation, and get the unique set. Same for the OCR output.

Ground truth words: Let's split the original text. The original has: REBOQUE, SUJEITOS, EXCLUSIVA, VIA, VEICULOS, MULTA, AUTOMOTORES, VLT, DO, E, A, DO, VLT. Wait, but the user says to consider only unique words from the ground truth. So unique words would be: reboque, sujeitos, exclusiva, via, veiculos, multa, automotores, vlt, do, e, a. Wait, "DO" appears twice, but as unique, it's just once. Similarly, "VLT" appears twice but is counted once. So unique words in ground truth are: reboque, sujeitos, exclusiva, via, veiculos, multa, automotores, vlt, do, e, a.

Now the OCR output is "NO GESTICULACIÓNEN ESTE TRÁNSITO". Let's split into words: NO, GESTICULACIÓNEN, ESTE, TRÁNSITO. Lowercase them: no, gesticulaciónen, este, transito. Now, check if any of these words are present in the ground truth set.

Looking at the ground truth words: reboque, sujeitos, exclusiva, via, veiculos, multa, automotores, vlt, do, e, a. The OCR words are no, gesticulaciónen, este, transito. None of these words are in the ground truth set. For example, "no" isn't in the ground truth. "Gesticulaciónen" is a typo or a different word. "Este" isn't there. "Transito" isn't in the ground truth either.

So, none of the OCR words match any of the unique ground truth words. Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it would be category 3. But wait, the user said that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output words are entirely different. For example, "gesticulaciónen" might be a typo for "gesticulación" or something else, but even if it were a typo for a word in the ground truth, there's no overlap. The ground truth words are all related to vehicles, traffic, penalties, etc., while the OCR output is about "no" (no), gesticulation, this, transit. These are unrelated. Therefore, there's no match. Hence, category 3.
