gt_text: PINKO
vlm_output: PINKO

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PINKO" and the VLM OCR output is also "PINKO". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "PINKO".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PINKO". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are uppercase, same spelling. No typos mentioned here. So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's exactly the same, the answer should be 1.
