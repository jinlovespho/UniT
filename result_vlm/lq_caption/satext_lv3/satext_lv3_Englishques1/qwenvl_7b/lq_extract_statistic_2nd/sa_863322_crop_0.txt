gt_text: SUPPLIES CB
vlm_output: CBSUPPLIES

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SUPPLIES CB" and the VLM OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "CBSUPPLIES". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SUPPLIES" and "CB". 

Now, looking at the OCR output: "CBSUPPLIES". If I split this into words, it's just one word "CBSUPPLIES". But maybe there's a space missing? Wait, the original ground truth has "SUPPLIES CB", which is two words. The OCR output might have merged them into one. However, the instructions say to ignore extra or missing spaces. So even if the OCR output has no space, it's still considered as the same words.

But wait, the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES" which is a single word. The ground truth has two words: "SUPPLIES" and "CB". Let me check if both words are present in the OCR output. 

If I split the OCR output into possible words, maybe it's "CB" and "SUPPLIES" but combined. Since the OCR might have merged them, but the instruction says to ignore spacing. So even if the OCR output is one word, as long as all the characters are there, maybe it's considered as containing both words. However, the problem is that the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", which is "CB" followed by "SUPPLIES". So if we split it as "CB" and "SUPPLIES", then both words from the ground truth are present. 

But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "SUPPLIES" and "CB". The OCR output has "CBSUPPLIES" as one word. However, if we consider that the OCR output might have merged the words, but the letters are present, then maybe it's considered as containing both words. However, the problem is that "CBSUPPLIES" is a single word, not two. But the instructions say to ignore spacing, so maybe even if they are merged, as long as all the characters are present, it's considered a match. 

Wait, but the ground truth words are "SUPPLIES" and "CB". The OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", which includes both "CB" and "SUPPLIES" as substrings. However, the instructions mention that the OCR output is compared based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to contain all the unique words from the ground truth, regardless of order, case, spacing, etc. 

But the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES". If we split it into words, perhaps it's "CB" and "SUPPLIES" (assuming that the OCR merged them into one word but the words are present as substrings). However, the problem is that the OCR output is a single word. But the instruction says to ignore spacing, so maybe the OCR output is considered as containing both words. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as a single word, and since the ground truth has two words, the OCR output doesn't have both words. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output has both "SUPPLIES" and "CB" as separate words (even if merged), then it's correct. But how do we determine that? 

Wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "SUPPLIES" and "CB". The OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES". If we split the OCR output into possible words, maybe it's "CBSUPPLIES" as one word. But that's not matching either of the ground truth words. However, the instruction says to ignore spacing. So if the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", which is the same as "CB" + "SUPPLIES" but without a space, then it's considered as containing both words. 

But I'm not sure. Another way: the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", which is the concatenation of "CB" and "SUPPLIES". So if we consider that the OCR output has both words, even if they are merged, then it's correct. But if the OCR output is a single word, then it's not containing the two words. However, the instruction says to ignore spacing. So maybe the OCR output is considered as having the words "CB" and "SUPPLIES" even if they are merged. 

In that case, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, so it's category 1. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as a single word, so it doesn't have both words. Then it's category 3. But that seems incorrect. 

The key is that the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES", which is the same as the ground truth's words combined. The ground truth is "SUPPLIES CB" (two words), and the OCR output is "CBSUPPLIES" (one word). But the instruction says to ignore spacing, so the OCR output is effectively "CB SUPPLIES" (with no space), which is the same as the ground truth but with the words in reverse order. But since word order doesn't matter, it's still correct. 

Therefore, the OCR output contains both words from the ground truth, just merged into one. So the category is 1.
