gt_text: PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K
vlm_output: MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLAZA MADRID MAYOR madrid Km. K" and the VLM OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR", which is all one word without spaces. The ground truth has several words: "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "madrid", "Km.", "K". But the category instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So I should first identify the unique words in the ground truth, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing.

Looking at the ground truth: "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "madrid", "Km.", "K". If we ignore case, "madrid" and "MADRID" are the same. Also, "Km." and "K" might be considered as "Km" and "K", but the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so "Km." becomes "Km" and "K" remains "K". However, the unique words would be "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "Km", "K". Wait, but "madrid" in the ground truth is lowercase, but the instruction says to ignore capitalization, so "madrid" and "MADRID" are the same. So the unique words are "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR", "Km", "K". Wait, but "Km." and "K" are separate? Or are they considered as "Km" and "K"? The instruction says to ignore punctuation, so "Km." becomes "Km" and "K" is just "K". So the unique words in the ground truth are "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k" (all lowercase for comparison).

Now, the OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". Let's break that down. If we split into possible words, it's "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR". But since there are no spaces, it's one long string. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, etc. So the OCR output has the words "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR" (assuming that the OCR output is a concatenation of those three words without spaces). 

Comparing to the ground truth's unique words: "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". The OCR output includes "PLAZA", "MADRID", "MAYOR" which are all present in the ground truth (ignoring case). However, the ground truth also has "km" and "k" which are not present in the OCR output. 

But the category 1 requires that all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output doesn't have "km" or "k", but the ground truth has those as unique words. Wait, but the ground truth has "Km." and "K". But the instruction says to ignore punctuation, so "Km." becomes "Km", and "K" is "K". So the unique words are "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". The OCR output has "plaza", "madrid", "mayor" but not "km" or "k". Therefore, not all unique words are present. 

But the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output is missing "km" and "k", it's not category 1. Then, category 2 is when at least one but not all unique words match. The OCR output has three words that match (plaza, madrid, mayor) out of five unique words. So that's more than one but not all. So it would be category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has five unique words (plaza, madrid, mayor, km, k). The OCR output has three of those (plaza, madrid, mayor). So at least one (actually three) but not all (five). Therefore, it's category 2. 

But wait, the user's instruction says "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth's unique words are "plaza", "madrid", "mayor", "km", "k". The OCR output has "madrid", "plaza", "mayor" (assuming that the OCR output is a concatenation of those three words). So three out of five. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2. 

So the answer should be 2.
