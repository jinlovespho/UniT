gt_text: Richards St.
vlm_output: W 4th St

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "Richards St." and the VLM OCR output is "W 4th St". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria and assign a category number (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "W 4th St". The ground truth is "Richards St.".

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But even with those considerations, I need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.

Let me break down the unique words in the ground truth. "Richards St." has two words: "Richards" and "St". The OCR output has "W", "4th", and "St". 

Now, looking at the unique words from the ground truth: "Richards" and "St". The OCR output includes "St" which matches exactly (ignoring case and punctuation, but here it's the same). However, "Richards" is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "W" and "4th" instead. 

So, the ground truth has "Richards" and "St". The OCR output has "St" but not "Richards". Therefore, only one of the two unique words from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories: Category 1 is when all unique words match. Since only one matches, it's not category 1. Category 2 is when at least one but not all match. That fits here. Category 3 is when none match or it's unrelated. Since "St" is present, it's not category 3.

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
