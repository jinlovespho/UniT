gt_text: RENEGADE
vlm_output: PARKING

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RENEGADE" and the VLM OCR output is "PARKING". I need to figure out which category this falls into based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PARKING", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "RENEGADE", which is a single word. So the unique words in ground truth are just {"RENEGADE"}.

Now, I need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "PARKING", which is a different word. Let me check if there are any typos or if they share any letters. "RENEGADE" vs. "PARKING" – they don't have any common letters except maybe 'R' and 'G'? Wait, "RENEGADE" has R, E, N, G, A, D, E. "PARKING" has P, A, R, K, I, N, G. So they share A, R, K, N, G. But the words themselves are different. However, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output isn't a typo of the ground truth word. "PARKING" isn't a misspelling of "RENEGADE"; they are entirely different words. So even though they share some letters, the words themselves don't match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which would require "RENEGADE" to be in "PARKING", which it's not), 2 if at least one but not all match. But since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have that word, then it's zero matches. So according to category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

So the answer should be 3. But wait, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. But the OCR output is "PARKING" and the ground truth is "RENEGADE". Even if we ignore capitalization, they are still different words. There's no overlap in the words. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
