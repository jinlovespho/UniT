Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "3" and the VLM OCR output is also "3". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "3", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the word "3". The OCR output is exactly "3". Since they are the same, all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "3") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, this should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match. No typos, no missing words. So the answer should be 1.
