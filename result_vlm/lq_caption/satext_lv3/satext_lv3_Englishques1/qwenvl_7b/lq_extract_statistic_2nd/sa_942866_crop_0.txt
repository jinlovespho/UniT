gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: QATAR

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "QATAR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "QATAR".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "QATAR". The OCR output has the same word. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly. According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
