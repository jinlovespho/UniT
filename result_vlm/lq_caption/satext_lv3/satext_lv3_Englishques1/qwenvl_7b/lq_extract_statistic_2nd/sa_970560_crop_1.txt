gt_text: GEOTAB
vlm_output: GEOTAB

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GEOTAB" and the VLM OCR output is also "GEOTAB". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "GEOTAB".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "GEOTAB" (since it's a single word). The OCR output also has "GEOTAB". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring case, but both are uppercase. There are no typos, extra spaces, or missing spaces. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth. 

Since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, even if there were typos, the category would still be 1. Here, there are no typos, so it's a perfect match. 

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
