gt_text: TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM
vlm_output: 1980

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM" and the OCR output is "1980". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "1980", which is a number. The ground truth is a Latin phrase with words like "TUUM", "SUB", "PRÆSIDI", and "UM". 

Moving to Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering the specified factors. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output is "1980", which is a number, not any of the words in the ground truth.

The ground truth has unique words: TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, UM. The OCR output is "1980", which is a four-digit number. None of the words in the ground truth are numbers. Even if we consider typos, "1980" doesn't resemble any of the words. For example, "PRÆSIDI" has letters that aren't in "1980". Also, the OCR output has no letters at all, just digits. So there's no overlap in terms of words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one matches (but none do), and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output is a number and the ground truth is Latin words, they are unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 149
2. Slightly Correct Num: 73
3. Incorrect Num: 416
