gt_text: 10
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "10", and the VLM OCR output is "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is the sentence about the image not having visible English text. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the number "10". The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth is "10", which is a single number. The OCR output has words like "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text." So, the unique words in the ground truth are just "10". 

But the OCR output doesn't have "10" in it. The OCR says there's no visible text, which might imply that the image doesn't have the number 10. However, according to the problem's instructions, we need to check if the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. Since "10" is a single word (even though it's a number), the OCR output doesn't have that word. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, etc.), 
2 if at least one matches but not all, 
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

In this case, the ground truth has one unique word ("10"), and the OCR output doesn't have it. The OCR output is saying there's no text, which might be a reason why "10" isn't present. But according to the instructions, we need to check if the OCR output contains the words from the ground truth. Since it doesn't, the category would be 3. 

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The ground truth is "10", which is a number. The OCR output is a sentence that says there's no visible English text. So the OCR output is not mentioning the number 10. Therefore, there's no match. Hence, category 3: incorrect.
