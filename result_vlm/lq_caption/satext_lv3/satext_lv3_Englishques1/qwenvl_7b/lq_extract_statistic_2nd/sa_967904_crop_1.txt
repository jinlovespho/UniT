gt_text: DB DB
vlm_output: 10%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DB DB" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. 

Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "DB" and "DB" again, but since we're considering unique words, it's just "DB". The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a percentage symbol.

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "DB" is not present in "10%". The OCR output has "10" and "%", which are numbers and a symbol, not matching "DB" at all. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's a complete mismatch. The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. 

Since "10%" has no words matching "DB", even considering case, spacing, or punctuation, the answer should be category 3.
