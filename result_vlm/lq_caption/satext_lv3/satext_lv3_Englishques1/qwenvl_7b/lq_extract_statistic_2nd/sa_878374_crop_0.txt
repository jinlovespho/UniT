gt_text: ROW MARMONT
vlm_output: 1970

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROW MARMONT" and the OCR output is "1970". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just the number 1970. Then, I compare that with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "ROW" and "MARMONT".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "ROW" and "MARMONT". Now, the OCR output is "1970", which is a number. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. But "1970" doesn't have either "ROW" or "MARMONT". There's no overlap. 

Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But again, the OCR output is numbers, not words. So no words match. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1970" is a number and doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, it's unrelated. 

So the answer should be category 3.
