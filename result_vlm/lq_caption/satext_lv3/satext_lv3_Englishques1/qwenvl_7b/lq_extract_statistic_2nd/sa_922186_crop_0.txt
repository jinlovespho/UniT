gt_text: MOMO MOMO cafe
vlm_output: SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MOMO MOMO cafe" and the VLM OCR output is "SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS". So that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Let's break down the ground truth text. The words are "MOMO", "MOMO", and "cafe". But since we're considering unique words, the unique words are "MOMO" and "cafe". 

Now, looking at the OCR output: "SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMICS". Let's split that into individual words: "SOUTHWESTERN", "UNIVERSITY", "OF", "FINANCE", "AND", "ECONOMICS". All these words are unique here. 

Comparing the unique words from the ground truth ("MOMO", "cafe") with the OCR output's words. None of the OCR words match "MOMO" or "cafe". Even if we consider case insensitivity, "MOMO" is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has words like "SOUTHWESTERN", "UNIVERSITY", etc., which are unrelated to "MOMO" or "cafe". 

There are no typos here because the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. The problem says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no match at all. 

So according to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words are present. Not the case here.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But here, none of the words match.
- Category 3: No words match or the output is unrelated. This fits because the OCR output has no words from the ground truth.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
