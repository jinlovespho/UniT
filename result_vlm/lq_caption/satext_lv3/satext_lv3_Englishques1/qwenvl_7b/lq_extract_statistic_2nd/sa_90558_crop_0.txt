gt_text: 058 DB 445
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "058 DB 445" and the VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence stating that there's no visible English text in the image. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "058", "DB", and "445". The OCR output, however, doesn't mention any of these words. Instead, it's saying there's no text present. 

Now, considering the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth words are "058", "DB", "445". The OCR output's text is "The image does not contain any visible English text." None of the ground truth words are present here. 

Even if we consider possible typos or variations, the OCR output doesn't have any of the numbers or the "DB" part. The OCR is stating that there's no text, which is conflicting with the ground truth. Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3 — Incorrect. The output is largely wrong because it claims there's no text when there actually is, and it doesn't include any of the correct words.
