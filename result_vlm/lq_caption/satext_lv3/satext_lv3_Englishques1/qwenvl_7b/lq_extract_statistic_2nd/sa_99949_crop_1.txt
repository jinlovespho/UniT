gt_text: VOLUME
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VOLUME" and the VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a statement that there's no visible English text in the image. So the extracted text is that entire sentence.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "VOLUME". The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words from the ground truth. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. The OCR output mentions "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text" – none of which are "VOLUME" or any variation of it. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output says there's no text, which is contradictory to the ground truth, but the actual words in the OCR output don't include "VOLUME" or any of its variations. Therefore, there are zero matches. So according to category 3, which is for no words matching or the output being wrong/unrelated, the answer should be 3.
