gt_text: Epsom
vlm_output: Epsom

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Epsom" and the VLM OCR output is also "Epsom". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Epsom", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Epsom". The OCR output also has "Epsom". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output is exactly correct.

So, according to the categories:
- Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Epsom" is the only word and it's present, this fits Category 1.
- Categories 2 and 3 don't apply here because there's a full match.

Therefore, the answer should be 1.
