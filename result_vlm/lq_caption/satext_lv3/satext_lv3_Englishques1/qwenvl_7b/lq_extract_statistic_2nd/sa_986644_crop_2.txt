gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: FRUIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "FRUIT", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Both texts have the same word "FRUIT", so order isn't an issue here. 

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT". The OCR output also has "FRUIT". 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are all caps, same word, no extra spaces or punctuation. The problem mentions ignoring these, so they don't affect the comparison.

Typos are mentioned to still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even with the considerations mentioned, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or partial matches here. The output is fully correct.
