gt_text: KLM
vlm_output: KLM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KLM" and the VLM OCR output is also "KLM". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "KLM", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "KLM".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same three letters. The ground truth has the words "KLM" and the OCR output also has "KLM". Wait, but are they considered as a single word or separate letters? The problem mentions "unique words in the ground truth". So maybe "KLM" is considered a single word here. 

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "KLM". The OCR output also has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are exactly the same. There are no typos mentioned here. So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. 

So the answer should be 1.
