gt_text: GRUNO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GRUNO" and the VLM OCR output is "TOKYO". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is "TOKYO". Then step 2 says to compare with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, only unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth is "GRUNO". Let's break it down. The unique words here are just "GRUNO". The OCR output is "TOKYO", which is a single word. Now, comparing "TOKYO" with "GRUNO". Are they the same? Well, ignoring case, "TOKYO" vs "GRUNO" – no, they are different. But the instructions say small typos count as matches. However, "TOKYO" and "GRUNO" aren't typos of each other. They are completely different words. So there's no match here.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output. Here, the ground truth has "GRUNO" and the OCR has "TOKYO", which doesn't match. So category 3 is when no words match or output is wrong. Since there's no match, it's category 3.
