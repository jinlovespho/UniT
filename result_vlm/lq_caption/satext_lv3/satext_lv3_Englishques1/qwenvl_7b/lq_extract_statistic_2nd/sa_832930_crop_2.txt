gt_text: Victoria Station
vlm_output: Victoria Station

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria Station" and the VLM OCR output is also "Victoria Station". The task is to compare them based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth. Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in reverse, it would still count. But in this case, both are exactly the same.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both texts are identical, all words match perfectly. There are no typos, extra spaces, or missing words. The unique words in the ground truth are "Victoria" and "Station", both of which are present in the OCR output. 

I should check if any of the other categories apply. Category 2 is for partial matches, but here all words match. Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated content, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the correct category is 1.
