Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Orange" and the VLM OCR output is also "Orange". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Orange", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Orange".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are just "Orange".

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Orange". The OCR output also has "Orange". So they are the same.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (both start with uppercase O), no punctuation, and no extra spaces. So no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (which they do), it's category 1. There's no case where part of the words match or none. So the answer should be 1.
