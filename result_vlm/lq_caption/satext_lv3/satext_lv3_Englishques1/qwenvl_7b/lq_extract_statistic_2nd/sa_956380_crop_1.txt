Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "21 21" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". So I need to follow the steps given to determine the category.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward. Then, compare it with the ground truth, considering the specified factors.

The ground truth has two instances of "21". But the OCR output is "100%". Let's break down the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, the OCR output isn't even numbers; it's a percentage.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "21".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "100%", which includes a percentage sign, but the ground truth has no punctuation. However, the OCR output's words are "100%" and the ground truth's is "21". So there's no overlap in the words themselves.
- Small typos still count as matches. But here, "100%" isn't a typo of "21"; they are entirely different numbers. Even if there was a typo, like "20" instead of "21", that would be a match. But "100%" is not a typo of "21".

So the unique word in the ground truth is "21". The OCR output has "100%", which is a different number. There's no match here. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 3 is "Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty." Since there's no match, it should be category 3.
