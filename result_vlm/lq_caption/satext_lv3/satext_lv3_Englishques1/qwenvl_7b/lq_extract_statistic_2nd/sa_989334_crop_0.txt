gt_text: M
vlm_output: M

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "M" and the VLM OCR output is also "M". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is just "M", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, there's only one word in both cases. The ground truth has the set of unique words as {"M"}. The OCR output has the same set. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase "M", so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces aren't present here. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there's no typo here since both are exactly the same.

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "M") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be correct. There's no partial match or any issues. The answer should be 1.
