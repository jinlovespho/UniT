gt_text: SOPHIA PPALI
vlm_output: WELCOME

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SOPHIA PPALI" and the VLM OCR output is "WELCOME". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "WELCOME". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SOPHIA" and "PPALI". 

Now, the OCR output is "WELCOME", which is a single word. Let's check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "WELCOME" doesn't contain "SOPHIA" or "PPALI" as substrings, even if we ignore case, punctuation, or spacing. There's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (which they aren't here), 
2 if at least one matches (but none do), 
3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Since "WELCOME" doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth, even considering typos, the answer should be category 3.
