gt_text: UNITED STATES ARMY
vlm_output: 1057

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNITED STATES ARMY" and the VLM OCR output is "1057". So, I need to check if the OCR output matches the ground truth based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1057", which is just numbers. The ground truth has words: UNITED, STATES, ARMY. 

Now, step 2: compare them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we have to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But wait, the OCR output is "1057", which are numbers, not words. The ground truth words are all in uppercase, but the OCR output has numbers. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none or unrelated. The OCR output here has no words from the ground truth. The numbers 1057 don't match any of the words UNITED, STATES, or ARMY. Even if we consider typos, the OCR output is numbers, not letters. So there's no overlap in words. 

Therefore, it's category 3 because the output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. The answer should be 3.
