gt_text: Neil
vlm_output: Neil

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Neil" and the VLM OCR output is also "Neil". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "Neil".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Neil". The OCR output is exactly the same. Even if there were minor typos, like "Neil" or "Neel", it would still count as a match. But in this case, it's exactly correct. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word, and it's fully matched. No typos, no missing words. So the answer should be 1.
