gt_text: ESCALATOR END OF
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "ESCALATOR END OF" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, moving to Step 2, which involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth. The ground truth text is "ESCALATOR END OF". If I split that into words, the unique words are "ESCALATOR", "END", and "OF". Now, the OCR output is "10%", which is a number followed by a percentage sign. 

Now, the comparison rules say to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But here, the OCR output doesn't have any of those words. "10%" is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, there's no way "10%" can be a typo for any of the words in the ground truth. "ESCALATOR" is a long word, "END" is short, and "OF" is a preposition. "10%" doesn't resemble any of them. 

Also, the categories are: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since none are present, that's not the case. Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But again, there's no match here. So it must be Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Another thing to check: are there any possible overlaps? For example, maybe "10%" could be a typo for "10% OF" or something, but that's stretching it. The OCR output is just "10%", which is a single token, not multiple words. The ground truth has three words. Since none of the words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, even considering case, spaces, etc., it's a clear mismatch. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 3.
