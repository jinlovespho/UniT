gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Bank".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific considerations: word order doesn't matter, we look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Bank". The OCR output is exactly the same. Even if there were minor differences like capitalization (like "bank" vs "Bank"), they would be ignored. Since both are identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, the answer should be 1.
