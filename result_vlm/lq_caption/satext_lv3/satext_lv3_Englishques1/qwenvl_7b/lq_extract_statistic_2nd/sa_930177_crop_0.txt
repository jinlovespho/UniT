gt_text: MAIRIE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAIRIE" and the OCR output is "100". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100", which is just numbers.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MAIRIE", which is a French word meaning "municipal council" or "town hall". The OCR output is "100", which is numerical.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MAIRIE". The OCR output has "100", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (ignoring case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or output is unrelated.

Since "100" is a number and not a word, and the ground truth is a word, there's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, "100" doesn't resemble "MAIRIE" in any way. Also, the OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. So, it's category 3.
