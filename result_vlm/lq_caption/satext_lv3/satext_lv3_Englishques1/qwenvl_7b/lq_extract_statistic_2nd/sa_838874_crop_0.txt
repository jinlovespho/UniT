Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "PKL" and the VLM OCR output is also "PKL". 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "PKL".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PKL". The OCR output also has "PKL". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here since they are identical. 

So, all unique ground truth words (just "PKL") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
