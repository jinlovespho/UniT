gt_text: CHASE CHASE
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHASE CHASE" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", so the extracted text is just that. Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the words "CHASE" and "CHASE". Since it's the same word repeated, the unique set is just {"CHASE"}. The OCR output is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. Now, we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Looking at "100%", there's no "CHASE" in there. The OCR output is entirely numerical and a symbol. There's no mention of the word "CHASE" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "CHASE" in any way. The criteria say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no word at all. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth words. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there are no matches, it's not even partially correct. Therefore, it falls into Category 3: Incorrect. The output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Even though the OCR output isn't empty, it's completely unrelated to the ground truth words. Hence, the answer should be 3.
