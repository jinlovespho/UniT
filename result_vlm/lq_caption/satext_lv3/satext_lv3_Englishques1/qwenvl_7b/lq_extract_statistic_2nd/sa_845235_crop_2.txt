gt_text: GALLERY HERE> ENTER
vlm_output: GALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GALLERY HERE> ENTER", and the VLM OCR output is "GALLERY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "GALLERY", so that's straightforward.

Next, I compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three parts: "GALLERY", "HERE>", and "ENTER". But according to the instructions, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me parse that. The ground truth text is "GALLERY HERE> ENTER". Breaking it down into words, considering that "HERE>" might be a typo or a misplaced symbol. However, the instructions say to ignore punctuation, so "HERE>" would be treated as "HERE". Similarly, "ENTER" is a word. So the unique words in the ground truth are "GALLERY", "HERE", and "ENTER".

Now, the OCR output is "GALLERY". Let's check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "GALLERY", which matches the first word. But it's missing "HERE" and "ENTER". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none match or the output is unrelated.

In this case, the OCR output has one of the three unique words. So that's at least one but not all. Therefore, it falls into category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo in "GALLERY" since it's exactly present. The other words "HERE" and "ENTER" aren't present at all. So the OCR output is missing two words. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2.
