gt_text: M-3175
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "M-3175" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "M-3175". But the OCR output is "100%". Let's break down the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, there's only one word in the ground truth and one in the OCR output.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "M-3175".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage, not related to "M-3175".
- Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output isn't even close to the ground truth word. There's no overlap in characters or structure.

So, the unique word in the ground truth is "M-3175", and the OCR output has "100%". There's no match here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words, even considering typos. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect, since no words match and the output is unrelated.
