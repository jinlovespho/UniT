gt_text: PayPal
vlm_output: PayPal

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PayPal" and the VLM OCR output is also "PayPal". The task is to compare them based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "PayPal", that's straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PayPal". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized the same. No punctuation or extra spaces. There are no typos here because they're identical. 

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "PayPal" is exactly matched, it's a correct match. So the answer should be 1.
