gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD BLVD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". So the extracted text is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD".

Next, I compare this with the ground truth, which is "HOLLYWOOD". The instructions say to consider word order as not important, so I don't need to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD".

Now, I need to check if "HOLLYWOOD" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "HOLLYWOOD" as the first part, followed by "BLVD". Since we're ignoring case, spacing, and punctuation, "HOLLYWOOD" in the OCR output matches exactly with the ground truth. The "BLVD" is an extra word, but since the ground truth only has "HOLLYWOOD", the presence of "HOLLYWOOD" in the OCR output is sufficient.

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present, which they are here (only "HOLLYWOOD" needs to be there).
2 if at least one but not all, which isn't the case here.
3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "HOLLYWOOD" is present, it's not category 3.

So the answer should be category 1.
