gt_text: BRÜCKE 10
vlm_output: 10

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BRÜCKE 10" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "10", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BRÜCKE" and "10". The OCR output only has "10". 

The instructions say to consider word order as not important. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words, but the OCR output only has one. 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. The OCR output has "10", which matches the "10" in the ground truth. However, "BRÜCKE" is missing. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words from ground truth are present in OCR (even with typos, etc.), 
2 if at least one but not all match, 
3 if none or unrelated.

Since the OCR output has one of the two words ("10") but misses "BRÜCKE", that's at least one match but not all. So it should be category 2. 

Wait, but the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". The ground truth's unique words are "BRÜCKE" and "10". The OCR output has "10" but not "BRÜCKE". So only one of the two words is present. That would be partially correct, hence category 2.
