gt_text: MUSEUM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is just numbers and a percentage sign. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. But I need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "MUSEUM", which is a single word. The OCR output is "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But the OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is "MUSEUM" which is a word. Since there's no overlap in the words (the OCR output has no letters, just numbers and symbols), there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "10%" has no letters, it can't match "MUSEUM" even with typos. So the answer should be 3.
