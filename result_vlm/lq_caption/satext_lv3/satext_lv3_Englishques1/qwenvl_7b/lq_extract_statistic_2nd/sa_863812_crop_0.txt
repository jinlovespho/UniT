Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1 1", and the VLM OCR output is "1". So I need to follow the steps given to determine the category.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 says to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering a few factors. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "1" and "1", but since we're looking at unique words, that's just "1".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output is "1", which is the same as the ground truth's unique word, so no issues here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case; the OCR output is exactly "1".

Now, the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "1", and the OCR output has "1". So that's a match. Even though the ground truth has two instances, the unique set is just one. Since the OCR output has that one, it's correct.

Wait, but the ground truth is "1 1", so the unique words are just "1". The OCR output is "1", which contains the same unique word. So according to the criteria, since all unique ground truth words (which is just "1") are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The OCR output has only one instance, but the ground truth has two. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words, not the count. So even if there are multiple instances in the ground truth, as long as the OCR output has all the unique ones (which it does here), it's correct. So the answer should be 1.
