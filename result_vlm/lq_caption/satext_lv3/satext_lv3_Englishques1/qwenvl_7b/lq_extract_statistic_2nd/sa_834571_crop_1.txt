gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: SOLD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SOLD" and the VLM OCR output is also "SOLD". The task is to compare them based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "SOLD", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are just one word: "SOLD". So order isn't an issue here.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SOLD". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so that's a match. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output is exactly correct, so the answer must be 1.
