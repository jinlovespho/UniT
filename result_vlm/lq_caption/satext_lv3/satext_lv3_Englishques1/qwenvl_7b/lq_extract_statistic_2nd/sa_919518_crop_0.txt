gt_text: BOTTEGA VENETA
vlm_output: BOTTEGA VENETA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "BOTTEGA VENETA" and the VLM OCR output is the same: "BOTTEGA VENETA". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so the extracted text is "BOTTEGA VENETA".

Step 2 is the comparison. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts have the same words in the same order. However, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BOTTEGA" and "VENETA". The OCR output also has those exact same two words. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, both are all caps with no punctuation or extra spaces. So there's no difference there. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is perfect.

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even if they were in a different order, it would still be category 1. But since they are in the same order and exact match, it's definitely category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. So the answer should be 1.
