Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "95" and the VLM OCR output is also "95". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "95", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are just "95", so order isn't an issue.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "95". The OCR output also has "95". So, the unique words match exactly.

The other considerations: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are just numbers without any letters or punctuation, there's nothing to adjust here. Also, there are no typos because both are the same. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, and 3 if none. Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth, it should be category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. Both texts are identical, so the answer must be 1.
