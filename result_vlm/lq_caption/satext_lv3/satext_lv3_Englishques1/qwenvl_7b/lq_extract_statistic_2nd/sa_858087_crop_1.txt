Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "211" and the VLM OCR output is "104". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "104". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore the sequence. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "211" which is a single number. So the unique words here are just "211".

Now, the OCR output is "104", which is a different number. The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but here "104" is not a typo of "211". They are completely different numbers. Also, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but in this case, there are no letters, so that's not an issue. The OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output doesn't have it, that would mean no matches. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even though both are numbers, they are different. There's no partial match here because the OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth's unique words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
