Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Steelers" and the VLM OCR output is also "Steelers". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Steelers", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Steelers".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Steelers". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: the unique words in ground truth are just "Steelers". The OCR output has "Steelers" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the other factors like capitalization, spacing, etc., are ignored. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Even if there were small typos, like "Stealers" or something, it would still count as a match. But here, it's exact.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique words match. There's no missing words, and the output isn't empty. So the answer should be 1.
