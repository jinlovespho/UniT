gt_text: ICE 9476
vlm_output: ICE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ICE 9476" and the VLM OCR output is "ICE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "ICE". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The categories are based on unique words. The ground truth has two words: "ICE" and "9476". The OCR output only has "ICE". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are ICE and 9476. The OCR output has ICE but not 9476. 

The category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the two is present. So that's not category 1. Category 2 is at least one but not all. Since "ICE" is present, even though "9476" isn't, that would be category 2. Category 3 is when none match or it's unrelated. But here, "ICE" does match, so it's not 3. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. The OCR output is missing the number part. So the answer should be category 2.
