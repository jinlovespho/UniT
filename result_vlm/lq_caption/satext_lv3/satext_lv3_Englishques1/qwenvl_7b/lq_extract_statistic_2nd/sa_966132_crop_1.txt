gt_text: MIRAI
vlm_output: Bosch

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRAI" and the VLM OCR output is "Bosch". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "Bosch". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MIRAI" since it's a single word. The OCR output is "Bosch", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "MIRAI" and "Bosch" are both single words with no punctuation or spaces. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the words are entirely different. "Bosch" isn't a typo of "MIRAI"; they are distinct words. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR output (which they aren't here),
2 if at least one but not all match (but there's only one unique word in ground truth, and it's not present),
3 if no words match or output is unrelated.

Since "Bosch" doesn't match "MIRAI" in any way, even considering the rules, the category should be 3. There's no overlap in the unique words. So the answer is 3.
