gt_text: SQUARE SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE 1BLE
vlm_output: Coca-Cola

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SQUARE SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE 1BLE" and the VLM OCR output is "Coca-Cola". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "Coca-Cola". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: SQUARE, SHIBUYA, SCRAMBLE, 1BLE. The OCR output has "Coca-Cola". 

Now, considering the comparison rules. The word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But looking at "Coca-Cola" versus the ground truth words, there's no overlap. The words in the ground truth are all place-related (Square, Shibuya, Scramble) and a number, while the OCR output is a brand name. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, "Coca-Cola" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we consider typos, there's no match here. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to category 3, which states that if no words match or the output is unrelated, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
