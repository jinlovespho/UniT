gt_text: RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA". The OCR output from the VLM is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a percentage symbol and numbers. Now, comparing this with the ground truth text.

The ground truth has several words: RUELLE, SAINTE, CARRUCETU, DEVOTE, DEVOTA, SANTA. All of these are French words, and they're all proper nouns or names. The OCR output is "10%", which is a numerical value with a percentage sign. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output's text is "10%", which doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, "10%" doesn't match any of the words. The words in the ground truth are all names, and "10%" is a number. There's no overlap in terms of words. 

Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, the OCR output isn't even close to any of the words. There's no partial match or typo that could be considered. 

So, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique words from the ground truth are present. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but again, there's no match. So it falls under Category 3, which is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 3.
