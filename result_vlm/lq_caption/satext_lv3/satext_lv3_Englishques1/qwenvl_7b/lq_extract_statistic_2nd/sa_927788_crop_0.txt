gt_text: TURY EMİNO
vlm_output: BOSCH

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TURY EMİNO" and the OCR output is "BOSCH". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "BOSCH". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "TURY" and "EMİNO". The OCR output has "BOSCH" as a single word.

Now, checking if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. "BOSCH" doesn't seem to match "TURY" or "EMİNO" even if I consider typos or case. The letters don't align. So there's no match for either word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match. Since neither "TURY" nor "EMİNO" are in "BOSCH", it's category 3. Also, the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
