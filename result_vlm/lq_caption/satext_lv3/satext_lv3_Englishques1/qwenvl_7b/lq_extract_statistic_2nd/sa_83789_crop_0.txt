Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "32" and the VLM OCR output is also "32". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "32", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "32".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly the same. The ground truth is "32" and the OCR output is "32". 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth is just "32", which is a single word (or number here), and the OCR output has exactly that, it should be category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, and everything matches. Even if there were typos, the note says small typos still count as matches, but here there are none. So the answer should be 1.
