Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1057" and the VLM OCR output is also "1057". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "1057", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are just a single number, so order isn't an issue. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "1057". The OCR output also has "1057". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are the same number with no punctuation or spaces, that's not a problem. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "1057") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's a correct match. There's no partial or incorrect elements here. The answer should be 1.
