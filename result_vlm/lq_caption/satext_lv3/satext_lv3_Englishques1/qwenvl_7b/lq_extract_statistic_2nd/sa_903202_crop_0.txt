gt_text: 24
vlm_output: The image is too blurry to read any text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "24". The VLM OCR output is "The image is too blurry to read any text."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the text content is all the words in that sentence. Then, I have to compare the extracted text with the ground truth.

The ground truth has the number "24". The OCR output doesn't have any numbers. It's talking about the image being blurry and not being able to read text. The unique words in the ground truth are just "24". The OCR output has words like "The", "image", "is", "too", "blurry", "to", "read", "any", "text". None of these words are "24" or any variation of it. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "24", the OCR output has no matching words. Even though the OCR output is about not being able to read text, it doesn't contain the actual number "24". 

So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. The user might have expected the OCR to recognize "24" but it's actually saying it can't read anything. So the answer should be 3.
