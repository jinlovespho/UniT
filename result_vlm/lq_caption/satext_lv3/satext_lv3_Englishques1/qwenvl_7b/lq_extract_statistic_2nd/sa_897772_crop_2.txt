gt_text: 8
vlm_output: The image does not contain any visible English text.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "8". The VLM OCR output says, "The image does not contain any visible English text."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the ground truth is just the number 8. So the extracted text from the OCR is the entire sentence: "The image does not contain any visible English text."

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "8". The OCR output doesn't have the number 8 anywhere. It's talking about the absence of English text. So the OCR output is saying there's no text, but the actual image has the number 8. 

Now, looking at the categories. The unique words in the ground truth are just "8". The OCR output's words are "The", "image", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "visible", "English", "text". None of these words match "8". Even if we consider typos or case, "8" is a number, and the OCR output has no numbers. So there's no match. 

Therefore, the category would be 3, since there are no matching words. The OCR output is incorrect because it didn't detect the presence of the number 8, which is the ground truth. Even if there's a typo, but in this case, the OCR output is completely missing the word. So it's category 3.
