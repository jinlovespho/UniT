gt_text: SAUF
vlm_output: Yield

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SAUF" and the VLM OCR output is "Yield". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "Yield".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "SAUF"—which is one word. But wait, "SAUF" might be a typo or a specific term. However, the OCR output is "Yield". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Let's check if "Yield" matches "SAUF". If we ignore case, "Yield" is lowercase, and "SAUF" is uppercase. But the words themselves are different. "Yield" and "SAUF" don't look similar. Are there any typos that could make them match? The problem mentions small typos still count as matches, but "Yield" and "SAUF" are quite different. For example, if the OCR had "sauv" or "sauve", that might be closer to "SAUF", but "Yield" is a different word entirely.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "SAUF". The OCR output has "Yield". There's no overlap here. So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Is "SAUF" a typo for "Yield"? For example, if the original text was "Yield" but the OCR read "SAUF", but in this case, the ground truth is "SAUF" and the OCR is "Yield". So the OCR is wrong. Since there's no matching word, even considering typos, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
