gt_text: ENTER NOT DO
vlm_output: FORT MYERS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ENTER NOT DO" and the VLM OCR output is "FORT MYERS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "FORT MYERS". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "ENTER", "NOT", "DO". The OCR output has two words: "FORT" and "MYERS". 

Now, I need to check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. Let's ignore case, so "FORT" vs "ENTER", "NOT", "DO". "MYERS" vs those words. 

Looking at "FORT" – none of the ground truth words are similar. "MYERS" also doesn't match any. So there are no matching words. 

But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the words are completely different. "FORT" isn't a typo of any ground truth word. Same with "MYERS". 

So according to the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output has words that are unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
