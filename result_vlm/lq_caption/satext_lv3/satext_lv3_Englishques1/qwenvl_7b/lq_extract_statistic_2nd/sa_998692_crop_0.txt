Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "86346" and the VLM OCR output is also "86346". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since both are the same, that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing them with specific considerations. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both texts are identical. 

The ground truth has one unique word, which is "86346". The OCR output also has "86346". Since they are exactly the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, this should be category 1. There's no mention of any typos or missing words here. Even if there were typos, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. 

So the answer should be 1.
