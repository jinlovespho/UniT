gt_text: MARINE MARINE LA LA MARINE
vlm_output: 1024

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MARINE MARINE LA LA MARINE". So the unique words here are "MARINE" and "LA", right? Because even though "MARINE" is repeated, we only consider unique ones. Then the VLM OCR output is "1024". 

Now, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's just "1024". Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Ignore case, punctuation, spaces, but small typos still count. 

So the ground truth's unique words are "MARINE" and "LA". The OCR output is "1024", which is numbers. There's no "MARINE" or "LA" in there. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. So according to the categories: category 3 is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1024" is numbers and doesn't contain any of the words, even with typos, it's not matching. So the answer should be category 3.
