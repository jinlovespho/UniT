Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is also "105". The task is to determine the category based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "105", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "105".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison needs to consider several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "105". Let's break that down. The unique words here are just "105" since it's a single number. The OCR output is also "105", which is exactly the same. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has that exact word, this should be a Category 1.

Wait, but the instructions mention considering word order doesn't matter. However, in this case, there's only one word, so order isn't an issue. Also, there's no capitalization or punctuation to worry about here. The OCR output matches exactly, so no typos to consider. Therefore, all conditions for Category 1 are met.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer should be Category 1.
