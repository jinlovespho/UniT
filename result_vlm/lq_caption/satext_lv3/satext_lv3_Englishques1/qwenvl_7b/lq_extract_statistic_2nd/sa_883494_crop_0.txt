gt_text: JOAN RED
vlm_output: 100%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JOAN RED" and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "100%", which is a percentage. Now, comparing this to the ground truth "JOAN RED", which are two names.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "JOAN" and "RED" are not present in "100%". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (even with typos, etc.), 
2 if at least one but not all match, 
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

Since "100%" doesn't contain "JOAN" or "RED", there are no matches. Therefore, it falls under category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 86
2. Slightly Correct Num: 32
3. Incorrect Num: 204
