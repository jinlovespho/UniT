gt_text: User guide
vlm_output: User guide

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "User guide" and the VLM OCR output is also "User guide". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth. Then, compare them considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, only the set of unique words from the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has two words: "User" and "guide". The OCR output has exactly the same words. Since they are identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were minor typos, like "User" vs "user" or "guid" vs "guide", it would still count as a match. But in this case, there are no differences. So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to be present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The answer should be 1.
