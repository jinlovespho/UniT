gt_text: KOREATOWN Galleria
vlm_output: KOREATOWNGalleria

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "KOREATOWN Galleria" and the VLM OCR output is "KOREATOWNGalleria". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "KOREATOWNGalleria". Then, I have to compare it with the ground truth, considering the specified conditions.

The key points to consider are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Only compare the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

Breaking down the ground truth: the words are "KOREATOWN" and "Galleria". The OCR output is "KOREATOWNGalleria" which seems like "KOREATOWN" and "Galleria" combined without a space. 

So, looking at the OCR output, "KOREATOWNGalleria" can be split into "KOREATOWN" and "Galleria" if we consider that the space is missing. Since the problem says to ignore extra or missing spaces, this should be treated as the same as the ground truth. Also, the capitalization in "Galleria" in the OCR output is the same as in the ground truth. 

The typo in "KOREATOWN" versus "KOREATOWNGalleria" is actually a missing space, but since we can ignore spacing, the OCR output still contains both words. Therefore, both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though they are merged. 

So, according to the categories, this would be category 1 because all unique ground truth words are present, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos.
