gt_text: RIKSTELEFON RIKSTELEFON
vlm_output: Hasselberg

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "RIKSTELEFON RIKSTELEFON" and the VLM OCR output is "Hasselberg". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Hasselberg". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "RIKSTELEFON" repeated twice, so the unique word is just "RIKSTELEFON".

Next, I need to check if the OCR output contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. The OCR output is "Hasselberg", which is a different word. Now, I should consider if there are any typos or if the words might be similar. However, "Hasselberg" doesn't look like a typo of "RIKSTELEFON". They are entirely different words. Also, ignoring capitalization and spacing, but in this case, the OCR output is a single word, and the ground truth is another single word. Since there's no overlap in the words, even considering typos, they don't match. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output has "Hasselberg", which is unrelated to "RIKSTELEFON". Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
