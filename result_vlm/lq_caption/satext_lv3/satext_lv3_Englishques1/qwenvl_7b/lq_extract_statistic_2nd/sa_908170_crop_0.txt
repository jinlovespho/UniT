gt_text: ROZA
vlm_output: No text is visible in the image.

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "ROZA". The VLM OCR output says "No text is visible in the image." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "No text is visible in the image." So the extracted text is that exact phrase.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The rules say word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ROZA". 

Now, the OCR output has words like "No", "text", "is", "visible", "in", "the", "image". None of these words are "ROZA" or any variation of it. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but "ROZA" isn't present in any form. Also, small typos would count as matches, but there's no typo here because the OCR didn't even detect the word. 

Since the OCR output says there's no text visible, it's essentially an empty response in terms of the actual text content. The category 3 is for when no words match or the output is empty. Therefore, this should be category 3.
