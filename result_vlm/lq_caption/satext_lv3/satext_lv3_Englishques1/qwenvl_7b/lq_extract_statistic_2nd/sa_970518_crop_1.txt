gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NIKE", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "NIKE". The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NIKE". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the rules: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. Typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. The answer should be 1.
