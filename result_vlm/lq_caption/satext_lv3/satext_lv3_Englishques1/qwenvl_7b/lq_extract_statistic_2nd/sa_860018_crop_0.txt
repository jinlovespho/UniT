gt_text: HOUSE ESSEX
vlm_output: 100

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "HOUSE ESSEX" and the OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just "100", which is a number. 

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "HOUSE" and "ESSEX". The OCR output has "100", which is a number. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output doesn't have any words from the ground truth. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any possible match. The OCR output is numbers, and the ground truth is words. Since the OCR output is "100", which is a number, it doesn't contain any of the words "HOUSE" or "ESSEX". Even if I ignore case, punctuation, etc., there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none or unrelated. Here, the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. So it's category 3.
