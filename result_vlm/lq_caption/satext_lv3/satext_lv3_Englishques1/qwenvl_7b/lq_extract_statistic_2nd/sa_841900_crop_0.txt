gt_text: San
vlm_output: San

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "San" and the VLM OCR output is also "San". 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "San", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are exactly "San".

Next, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "San". The OCR output also has "San". So, the unique words match exactly.

Then, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, both are lowercase and have no punctuation or extra spaces. So, no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "San" is present in both, this meets category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
