gt_text: Hilton
vlm_output: Hilton

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Hilton" and the VLM OCR output is also "Hilton". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "Hilton".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly "Hilton".

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Hilton". The OCR output also has "Hilton". So they match exactly.

The other considerations: ignore capitalization. But both are capitalized the same. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
