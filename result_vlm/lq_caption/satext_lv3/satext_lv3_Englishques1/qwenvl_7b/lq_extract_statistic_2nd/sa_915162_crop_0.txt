gt_text: HUAWEI
vlm_output: HUAWEI

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUAWEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "HUAWEI". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the steps given. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HUAWEI". The OCR output also has "HUAWEI", so that's a match. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here, so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces are to be ignored, but there are none here. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 125
2. Slightly Correct Num: 57
3. Incorrect Num: 326
