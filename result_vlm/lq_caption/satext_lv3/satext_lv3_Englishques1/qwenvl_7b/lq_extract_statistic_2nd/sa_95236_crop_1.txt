gt_text: TADANO ZE500
vlm_output: TADANO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TADANO ZE500" and the VLM OCR output is "TADANO". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "TADANO". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "TADANO" and "ZE500". The OCR output only has "TADANO". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "TADANO" and "ZE500". The OCR output has "TADANO" but not "ZE500". 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: none or unrelated.

Since the OCR output has one of the two words, that's at least one but not all. So according to category 2, it's partially correct. The answer should be 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 171
2. Slightly Correct Num: 86
3. Incorrect Num: 477
