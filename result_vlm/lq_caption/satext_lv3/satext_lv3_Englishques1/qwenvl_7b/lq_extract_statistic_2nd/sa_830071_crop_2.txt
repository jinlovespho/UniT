Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NISSAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "NISSAN". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "NISSAN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "NISSAN".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. The ground truth has "NISSAN" as the only word. The OCR output is also "NISSAN". 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "NISSAN", and the OCR output has the same, that matches. Also, the instructions mention ignoring case, spacing, etc. Here, both are uppercase, same spacing (no spaces), and no typos. So even if there were small typos, they would still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So, all conditions for category 1 are met. The answer should be 1.
