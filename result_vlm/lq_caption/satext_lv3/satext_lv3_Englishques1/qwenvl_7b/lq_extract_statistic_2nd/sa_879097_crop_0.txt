gt_text: 251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION
vlm_output: 251

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION" and the VLM OCR output is "251". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "251".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

So, breaking down the ground truth into unique words: "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". The OCR output is "251". 

Now, checking which words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The number "251" is present. However, the other words like "DEPT", "OF", and "TRANSPORTATION" are missing. 

But the category definitions say that for category 1, all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Here, only one out of four words is present. So it's not category 1. 

Category 2 is partially correct, meaning at least one but not all. Since "251" is present, that's one match. The others are missing. So this would be category 2. 

Wait, but the OCR output is only "251". The ground truth has more words. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has "251", which is one of the unique words. So even though the other words are missing, since at least one is present, it's category 2. 

But wait, maybe I need to check if the OCR output contains any of the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". The OCR output is "251", which matches the first word. So that's at least one match. Therefore, category 2. 

But what if the OCR output had none? Then it would be category 3. But here, there's at least one. So category 2. 

But wait, the problem says "all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos)" for category 1. Since the OCR output only has one of the four, it's not category 1. So category 2 is correct.
