gt_text: WELCOME IOS TO RAVEL TICKETS
vlm_output: WELCOME TO GIBS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "WELCOME IOS TO RAVEL TICKETS" and the VLM OCR output is "WELCOME TO GIBS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is already given as "WELCOME TO GIBS". 

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: WELCOME, IOS, TO, RAVEL, TICKETS. 

Now, I need to check which of these words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has WELCOME, TO, and GIBS. 

Comparing each unique ground truth word:
- WELCOME is present in both.
- IOS is not in the OCR output.
- TO is present.
- RAVEL is not present.
- TICKETS is not present.

So, the OCR output has two words that match (WELCOME and TO) out of the five unique words in the ground truth. The category definitions say that category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since only two out of five are present, that's not category 1. Category 2 is when at least one but not all match. Here, two words match, which is more than one but not all. So this would be category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output has "GIBS" instead of "RAVEL" or "TICKETS". There's no typo here, just a complete substitution. So "GIBS" doesn't match any of the ground truth words. Therefore, the only matches are WELCOME and TO. 

So, the answer should be category 2 since at least one but not all unique words match.
