gt_text: MAN NEOPLAN MAN
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAN NEOPLAN MAN", and the VLM OCR output is "100%". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100%", so the extracted text is that.

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "MAN" and "NEOPLAN". But the OCR output is "100%", which is a percentage. 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we have to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The unique words in the ground truth are "MAN" and "NEOPLAN". 

But the OCR output is "100%", which doesn't contain either of those words. There's no "MAN" or "NEOPLAN" in "100%". Also, considering that we ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "100%" is numbers and a symbol, which don't match the words in the ground truth. 

Small typos still count as matches, but here there's no typo; the words are entirely different. So, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
