gt_text: VUITTON LOUIS
vlm_output: LOUIS VUITTON

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VUITTON LOUIS" and the OCR output is "LOUIS VUITTON". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "LOUIS VUITTON". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "VUITTON" and "LOUIS". The OCR output has the same two words but in reverse order. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though they're reversed, the words are present. Also, capitalization is ignored, so "LOUIS" and "VUITTON" in the OCR match the ground truth's "VUITTON" and "LOUIS" when case is ignored. 

There are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth, just swapped. Since the set of unique words in the OCR output includes both "LOUIS" and "VUITTON", which are the same as the ground truth's words (ignoring case), this should be a correct match.

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
