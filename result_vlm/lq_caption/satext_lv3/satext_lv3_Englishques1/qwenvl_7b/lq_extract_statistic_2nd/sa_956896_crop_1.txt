gt_text: 226
vlm_output: TATA

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "226" and the VLM OCR output is "TATA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "TATA", which is all uppercase letters. The ground truth is the number "226".

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But wait, the ground truth here is a number, not a word. The unique words in the ground truth would be just "226", right? But the OCR output is "TATA", which is letters, not numbers. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the ground truth is a number, and the OCR output is letters. Since there's no overlap in characters (assuming "TATA" doesn't have any numbers), there's no matching. Also, typos are considered, but "TATA" isn't a typo of "226" because they are different character types. 

So, the unique word in the ground truth is "226", which isn't present in the OCR output. Therefore, there are no matches. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth since they are different types of characters. Hence, the answer should be 3.
