gt_text: LIGHT 249g ULTRA
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "LIGHT 249g ULTRA" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "100". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

So the ground truth has three unique words: LIGHT, 249g, and ULTRA. The OCR output is "100". Let's check each word. 

"LIGHT" – the OCR output has no mention of that. "249g" – the OCR has "100", which is a number but not matching the 249g. "ULTRA" – again, not present. 

Since the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth, even considering typos or case, the category would be 3. The output is "100" which is a number, but the ground truth words are all different. There's no overlap. So the answer should be 3.
