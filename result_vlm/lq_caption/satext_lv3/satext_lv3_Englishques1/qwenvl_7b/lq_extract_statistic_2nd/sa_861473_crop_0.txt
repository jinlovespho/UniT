gt_text: INTERCONTINENTAL

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INTERCONTINENTAL" and the OCR output is "1000". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1000". Now, comparing this to the ground truth "INTERCONTINENTAL". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But wait, the ground truth is a single word, and the OCR output is also a single word, but they are different. However, the unique words in the ground truth are just "INTERCONTINENTAL". The OCR output is "1000", which is a number. 

The next point is to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word. The OCR output has "1000", which isn't a word but a number. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "1000" isn't even a word; it's a numeral. The ground truth is a proper noun, a hotel name perhaps. 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is completely different. There's no overlap in the words. The ground truth has "INTERCONTINENTAL" and the OCR output has "1000". Since there are no matching words, even considering the rules, this would fall into category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if "1000" is a typo for "INTERCONTINENTAL"? But "1000" is four characters, while "INTERCONTINENTAL" is longer. The OCR might have misread letters as numbers, but the problem states that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the OCR output isn't even close. It's not a typo but a completely different string. Therefore, there are no matching words. 

So according to the categories, category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1000" doesn't contain any part of the ground truth word, even when considering ignoring case and spacing, it's unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
