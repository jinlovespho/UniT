Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MEDELLIN" and the VLM OCR output is also "MEDELLIN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "MEDELLIN".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MEDELLIN". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. The OCR output matches exactly, so there are no typos. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words or any discrepancies. So the answer should be category 1.
