----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "TECHNOGYM TECHNOGYM TECHNOGYM". So the unique word here is just "TECHNOGYM". 

Now, looking at the VLM OCR output: "The image contains the following text:- "HOTEL"- "RESTAURANT"". The extracted text here would be "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT". 

Comparing the unique words from the ground truth, which is "TECHNOGYM", with the OCR output's words "HOTEL" and "RESTAURANT". None of these words match. The OCR output has completely different words. 

Even if we consider typos or case, there's no overlap. The ground truth word isn't present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3.
