gt_text: MANG
vlm_output: 10%

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MANG" and the VLM OCR output is "10%". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10%", which is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth is "MANG", which is a four-letter word. 

Next, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MANG". The OCR output has "10%", which is a number and a symbol. 

Now, I need to check if there's any match between the OCR output and the ground truth words. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "MANG" is a word, and "10%" is a numerical value with a symbol. There's no overlap in terms of words here. The OCR output doesn't contain the word "MANG" or any of its variations. Even if we consider typos, "10%" doesn't resemble "MANG" in any way. 

Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR output has none of those words, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match, and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
