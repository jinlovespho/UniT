gt_text: WORLD CENTER NEW
vlm_output: HARVEY NICHOLS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "WORLD CENTER NEW" and the VLM OCR output is "HARVEY NICHOLS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HARVEY NICHOLS", which is straightforward. Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth, following the given criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I don't need to check the sequence of words. Then, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "WORLD", "CENTER", and "NEW". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "HARVEY" and "NICHOLS". Looking at each word in the ground truth:

- "WORLD" isn't in the OCR output.
- "CENTER" isn't there either.
- "NEW" also isn't present.

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, even considering possible typos (but there are no typos here, just completely different words), the OCR output doesn't match any of the required words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Here, since none of the words match, it falls under category 3. The OCR output is entirely different and unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
