Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "15" and the VLM OCR output is also "15". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "15", so that's straightforward. The ground truth is the same, "15".

Now, step 2 is comparing them with certain conditions. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "15". The OCR output also has "15". So the unique words match.

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are just numbers with no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here because they are exactly the same.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "15" is present in the OCR output, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
