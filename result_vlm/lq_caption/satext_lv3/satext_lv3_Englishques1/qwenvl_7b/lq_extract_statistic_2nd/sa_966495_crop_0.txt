gt_text: DURANCE POW
vlm_output: PRODURANCE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DURANCE POW" and the OCR output is "PRODURANCE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "PRODURANCE". Then, compare it with the ground truth, considering the given rules.

The ground truth has two words: "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has one word: "PRODURANCE". 

But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "DURANCE" and "POW". Now, the OCR output is "PRODURANCE". Let's check if any of the ground truth words are present here, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos.

Looking at "PRODURANCE", if I split it into parts, maybe "PRO" and "DURANCE"? But the original ground truth has "DURANCE" as a whole word. However, "PRODURANCE" is a single word. So does "DURANCE" appear within "PRODURANCE"? If we consider that "DURANCE" is a substring of "PRODURANCE", then maybe it's considered a match. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. However, the OCR output doesn't have "POW" at all. 

Wait, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has "PRODURANCE". So, does "PRODURANCE" contain "DURANCE"? If we ignore typos and consider that "PRODURANCE" might be a typo or a merged version of "PRO" and "DURANCE", then maybe "DURANCE" is considered present. But "POW" is not present in the OCR output. 

But the rules also say that small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR output is "PRODURANCE" which is a single word. The ground truth has two words. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to have all the unique words from the ground truth. But in this case, the OCR output only has "PRODURANCE", which might include "DURANCE" as part of it. But is that considered a match? 

Wait, the rules mention that word order does not matter, but the OCR output is a single word. If "PRODURANCE" is considered to contain "DURANCE" (assuming that the OCR might have merged "PRO" and "DURANCE"), then maybe "DURANCE" is present. However, the "POW" is missing. So in that case, only one of the two ground truth words is present. So according to the categories, that would be category 2 (partially correct). 

But maybe the OCR output is "PRODURANCE" which could be a typo for "PRO DURANCE", which would include "DURANCE" and "PRO". But the ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". So "PRO" isn't in the ground truth. So even if "PRODURANCE" is split into "PRO" and "DURANCE", the ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". So only "DURANCE" is present, not "POW". Therefore, only one of the two words matches, so category 2. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output is considered as a single word, maybe it's not matching either of the ground truth words. But "DURANCE" is a substring of "PRODURANCE". However, the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must have the words from the ground truth. If the OCR output is "PRODURANCE", does that count as containing "DURANCE"? Maybe, if we allow for typos and consider that the OCR might have merged words. 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has "PRODURANCE". So if "PRODURANCE" is considered to have "DURANCE" (as a substring, possibly with a typo), then that's one match. "POW" is not present. So that's one out of two, hence category 2. 

Therefore, the answer should be 2.
