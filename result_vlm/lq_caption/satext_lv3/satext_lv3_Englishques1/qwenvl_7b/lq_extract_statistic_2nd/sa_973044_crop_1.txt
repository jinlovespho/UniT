gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: SHAKERS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHAKERS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "SHAKERS", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHAKERS".

Next, I need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both the ground truth and OCR output are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in that regard. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because both are the same.

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. The category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth when considering all the specified factors.
