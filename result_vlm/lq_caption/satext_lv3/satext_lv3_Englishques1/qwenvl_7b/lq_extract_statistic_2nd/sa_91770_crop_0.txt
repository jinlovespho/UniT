Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "28" and the VLM OCR output is also "28". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "28", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "28".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "28". Now, the comparison has some specific rules. The word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, that's not an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "28". The OCR output also has "28". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. Also, small typos still count as matches. Since there's no typo here, it's a direct match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "28" is the only word and it's present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, nothing else. So the answer should be 1.
