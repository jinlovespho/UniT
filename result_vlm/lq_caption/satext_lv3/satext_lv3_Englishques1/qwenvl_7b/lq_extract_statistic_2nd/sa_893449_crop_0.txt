gt_text: POSTAGE
vlm_output: POSTAGE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POSTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POSTAGE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "POSTAGE". The OCR output has the same word. 

Next, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and single word. So they match exactly. Even if there were typos, like "POSTAG" or "POSTAGEE", but in this case, it's exact. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no partial matches here. The answer should be 1.
