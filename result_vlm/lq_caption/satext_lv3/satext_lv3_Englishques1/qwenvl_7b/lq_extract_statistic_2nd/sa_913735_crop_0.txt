gt_text: Schweppes
vlm_output: Schweppes

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Schweppes" and the VLM OCR output is also "Schweppes". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Schweppes", that's straightforward. The extracted text is the same as the OCR output.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, that's not an issue here. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Schweppes". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. There's no punctuation, and the spacing is just a single word. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here because both are identical.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
