gt_text: HAMBURG SÜD
vlm_output: SUNSETBEACH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HAMBURG SÜD" and the VLM OCR output is "SUNSETBEACH". I need to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SUNSETBEACH". So that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "HAMBURG" and "SÜD". Wait, but the ground truth is "HAMBURG SÜD" which is two words. However, the OCR output is "SUNSETBEACH", which is one word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But here, the OCR output is a completely different word. Let me check if any part of "SUNSETBEACH" could be considered a match for "HAMBURG" or "SÜD" even with typos. 

Looking at "SUNSETBEACH" versus "HAMBURG": there's no overlap in letters that would suggest a typo. Similarly, "SÜD" is a German word meaning "south", and "SUNSETBEACH" doesn't contain any part that resembles "SÜD" even with typos. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "HAMBURG" and "SÜD". The OCR output has only "SUNSETBEACH", which doesn't contain either of those words, even when considering possible typos or ignoring case. Therefore, there are no matches for the unique ground truth words. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
