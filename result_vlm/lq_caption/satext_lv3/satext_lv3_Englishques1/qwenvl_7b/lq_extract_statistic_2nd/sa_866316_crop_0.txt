Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "13" and the VLM OCR output is also "13". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "13".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth is "13", which is a single number. The OCR output is the same. Since they're identical, all unique words (which is just "13") are present. There are no typos, and the order is the same. So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique words match. 

I don't see any issues here. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the category should be 1.
