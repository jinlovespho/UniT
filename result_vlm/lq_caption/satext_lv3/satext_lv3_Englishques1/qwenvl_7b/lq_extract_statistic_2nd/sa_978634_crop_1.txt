gt_text: 131 BEAT 艺术空间
vlm_output: 1980

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "131 BEAT 艺术空间" and the OCR output is "1980". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "1980". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "131", "BEAT", and "艺术空间". 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, check if any of the OCR words match any of the ground truth words. 

The OCR output is "1980". Let's break down the ground truth words. "131" is a number, "BEAT" is an English word, and "艺术空间" is a Chinese term. The OCR output is a number, 1980. 

Comparing each part: "1980" doesn't match "131" (they are different numbers), "BEAT" is not present, and "艺术空间" is not in the OCR output. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there were a typo, like if the OCR had "131" but misspelled as "130", that would still be a match. But here, the OCR output is entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
