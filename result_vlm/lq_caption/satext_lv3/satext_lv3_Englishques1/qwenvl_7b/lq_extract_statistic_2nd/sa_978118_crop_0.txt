gt_text: TAKST BYGGKONTROLL
vlm_output: 100

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TAKST BYGGKONTROLL" and the VLM OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "100", which is a number. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which consists of two words: "TAKST" and "BYGGKONTROLL". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "TAKST" and "BYGGKONTROLL". The OCR output is "100", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. 

Next, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "100" doesn't contain either "TAKST" or "BYGGKONTROLL". Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no overlap in words at all. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words are present (which isn't the case here),
2 if at least one but not all match (but there are zero matches here),
3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth, it falls into category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated to the ground truth words. So the answer should be 3.
