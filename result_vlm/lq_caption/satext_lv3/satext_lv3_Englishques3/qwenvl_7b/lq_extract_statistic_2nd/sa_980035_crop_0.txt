gt_text: RANCH THE HOUSE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "TOILET"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RANCH THE HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "TOILET"". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "TOILET" is visible. So the extracted text is just "TOILET".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three unique words: "RANCH", "THE", and "HOUSE". The OCR output only has "TOILET". 

Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to see if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "TOILET" doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. Even considering typos, "TOILET" isn't close to "RANCH", "THE", or "HOUSE". 

So, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
