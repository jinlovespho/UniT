gt_text: 44 00:56:44
vlm_output: 00:56:44

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "44 00:56:44" and the VLM OCR output is "00:56:44". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "00:56:44". 

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "44" and "00:56:44". The OCR output has only "00:56:44". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are "44" and "00:56:44". The OCR output has "00:56:44" but not "44". 

So, the OCR output is missing one of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since "00:56:44" is present but "44" is missing, that would be partially correct. 

But wait, maybe "44" is part of the "00:56:44"? No, the ground truth has both "44" and the time. The OCR output only has the time. So the unique words in the ground truth are two separate elements. The OCR output only matches one of them. Therefore, it's category 2.
