gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UBS". The VLM OCR output says "THE visible English words and letters in the image are: 'THE'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" as the visible words. So the extracted text is "THE".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "UBS". The unique words in the ground truth are just "UBS". The OCR output has "THE". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from ground truth are present. However, "UBS" isn't in the OCR output. The OCR output has "THE", which is a different word. Also, considering that the OCR might have missed the actual text and instead mentioned "THE" as the visible words. 

Since the ground truth is "UBS" and the OCR output has "THE", there's no match. The categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. Even though there's a typo possibility, but "THE" and "UBS" are different words. So the answer should be 3.
