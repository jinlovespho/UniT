gt_text: NIKE zoomx
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"NIKE"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NIKE zoomx" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English word in the image is:"NIKE"". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible English word in the image is:"NIKE"" — so the actual text extracted here is "NIKE". The quotes might be part of the OCR's formatting, but the main content is "NIKE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR output only has "NIKE". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "NIKE" and "zoomx". The OCR output has "NIKE" but not "zoomx". 

Now, the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. If at least one but not all, it's category 2. If none or unrelated, category 3. Here, only one of the two words is present. So that would be category 2. 

But wait, the problem says "small typos still count as matches". However, in this case, there's no typo in "NIKE", it's exactly present. But "zoomx" is missing entirely. So the OCR didn't capture that part. Since the ground truth has two words and the OCR only got one, it's partially correct. So the answer should be 2.
