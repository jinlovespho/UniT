gt_text: Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE
vlm_output: Tropical

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE" and the VLM OCR output is just "Tropical". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "Tropical".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are based on whether all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Let me break down the ground truth. The words are "Tropical", "CERVEZA", "CANARIAS", "DE". The OCR output is only "Tropical". 

Now, checking each unique word from the ground truth against the OCR output. The OCR output has "Tropical" which matches "Tropical" in the ground truth. But the other words—CERVEZA, CANARIAS, DE—are not present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, etc.), 
2 if at least one but not all match, 
3 if none or largely wrong.

In this case, only one of the four unique words from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. So it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.
