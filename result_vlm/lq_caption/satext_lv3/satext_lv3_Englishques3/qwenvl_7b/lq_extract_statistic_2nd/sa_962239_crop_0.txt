gt_text: POLITIE POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLITIE POLITIE" and the VLM OCR output is "POLITIE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "POLITIE", which is a single instance of the word "POLITIE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two instances of "POLITIE", but since the instructions say to consider only the set of unique words, the ground truth's unique words are just {"POLITIE"}.

Now, checking the OCR output's unique words. The OCR output has "POLITIE" once, so its unique set is also {"POLITIE"}.

The comparison criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, capitalization, punctuation, and spacing are ignored. Also, small typos still count as matches. Here, there are no typos because both are exactly "POLITIE". 

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "POLITIE") are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. Even though the OCR output has only one instance versus two in the ground truth, the category is based on the presence of the unique words, not their frequency. So, category 1 is correct.
