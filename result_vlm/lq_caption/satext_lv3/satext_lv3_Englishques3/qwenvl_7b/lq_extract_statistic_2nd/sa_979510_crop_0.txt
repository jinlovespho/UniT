gt_text: RESTAURANT GRILL Bälliz
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"Hotel Restaurant"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RESTAURANT GRILL Bälliz" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"Hotel Restaurant"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Hotel Restaurant". So the extracted text here is "Hotel Restaurant".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "RESTAURANT", "GRILL", and "Bälliz". But the OCR output only has "Hotel" and "Restaurant". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we just look at the set of words. We need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output has "Hotel" and "Restaurant". The ground truth has "RESTAURANT" (which is the same as "Restaurant" if we ignore case) and "GRILL" and "Bälliz". 

So, "Restaurant" matches "RESTAURANT" (case-insensitive), but "Hotel" isn't in the ground truth. The OCR output is missing "GRILL" and "Bälliz". Therefore, only one of the three ground truth words is present. 

According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer should be 2.
