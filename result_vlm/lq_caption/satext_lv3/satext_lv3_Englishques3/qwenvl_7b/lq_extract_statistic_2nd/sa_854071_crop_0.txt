gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has "NANTES". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are all caps, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. Also, typos are considered matches if small. But there are no typos here; they are identical.

So the category is 1 because all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There's only one word, and it's exactly the same. So the answer should be 1.
