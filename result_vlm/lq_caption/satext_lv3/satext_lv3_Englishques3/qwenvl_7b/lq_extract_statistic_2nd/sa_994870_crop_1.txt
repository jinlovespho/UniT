Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "52" and the VLM OCR output is also "52". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "52", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "52".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "52". Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single numbers. Since they are the same, the unique words (which is just "52" in both cases) should match.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since both are exactly the same, all unique words (only one here) are present. So that would be category 1.

Wait, but the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So there's no typo, no extra spaces, etc. So according to the rules, even if there were small typos, they still count as matches. But here, there are no typos. So definitely, it's a correct match. So the answer should be 1.
