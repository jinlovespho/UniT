gt_text: Wolt
vlm_output: Wolt

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Wolt" and the VLM OCR output is also "Wolt". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "Wolt".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Wolt". The OCR output also has "Wolt". So the unique words match.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. No issues here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly correct.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it matches perfectly, this should be category 1.
