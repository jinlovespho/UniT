gt_text: Investors For 39
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:```1234567890```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the OCR output from the VLM.

First, let's look at the ground truth text: "Investors For 39". The unique words here are "Investors", "For", and "39". 

Next, the OCR output provided is: "The visible English words and letters in the image are:```1234567890```". The extracted text from this OCR output is the numbers "1234567890". 

Now, according to the instructions, we need to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points to consider are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth words: "Investors", "For", "39". The OCR output only has numbers. The numbers in the OCR output are "1234567890", which are digits, not words. The ground truth includes the word "39", which is a number, but in the OCR output, there's no mention of "39" or any of the other words like "Investors" or "For". The OCR output only has digits, which are not considered words here. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth ("Investors", "For", "39") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the required words, even though it's a number. The problem states that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, and since the OCR output has none of those, it's a complete mismatch.
