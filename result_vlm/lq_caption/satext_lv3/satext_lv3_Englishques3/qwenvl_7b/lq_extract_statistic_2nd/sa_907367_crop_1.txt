gt_text: GR
vlm_output: GR

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "GR" and the VLM OCR output is also "GR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "GR".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly "GR".

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two characters, but since they're letters, maybe they're considered as a single word? Wait, the problem says "unique words", so if "GR" is a single word, then the ground truth has one unique word. The OCR output also has "GR", which is the same. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there are none. Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "GR") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, this should fall under category 1 — Correct.
