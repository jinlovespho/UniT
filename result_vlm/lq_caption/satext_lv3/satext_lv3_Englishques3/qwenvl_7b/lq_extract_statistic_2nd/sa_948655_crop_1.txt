gt_text: 2,2 M
vlm_output: NoParking

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "2,2 M" and the VLM OCR output is "NoParking". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "NoParking". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "2,2" and "M". The OCR output has "No" and "Parking". 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. The ground truth words are "2,2" and "M". The OCR output words are "No" and "Parking". None of these words are similar or match even with the allowed considerations. 

Even if I consider typos, "No" doesn't resemble "2,2" or "M". "Parking" also doesn't match. The OCR output is entirely different in terms of words. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3 — Incorrect.
