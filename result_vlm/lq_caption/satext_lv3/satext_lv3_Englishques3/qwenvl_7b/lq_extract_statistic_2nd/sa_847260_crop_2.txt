gt_text: HUMBOLD
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```S```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HUMBOLD" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```S```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```S```". The part inside the backticks is "S", so the extracted text is just "S".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HUMBOLD". Now, considering the rules given:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, the OCR output has only "S" and the ground truth has "HUMBOLD". 
- We need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HUMBOLD".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "S" is a single letter, and "HUMBOLD" is a longer word. Even if we ignore case, "S" doesn't match "HUMBOLD".
- Small typos still count as matches. However, "S" isn't a typo of "HUMBOLD"; they are completely different words. There's no overlap in letters that would make "S" a typo of "HUMBOLD".

So, the OCR output's extracted text is "S", which doesn't match the ground truth word "HUMBOLD" in any way. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories:
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, none are.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. But since there's only one word in the ground truth and it's not matched, this doesn't apply.
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output here is "S", which is unrelated to "HUMBOLD".

Thus, the answer should be category 3.
