gt_text: Hobie
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"YACHTS"

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Hobie" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"YACHTS""

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"YACHTS"". So the actual extracted text here is "YACHTS". The rest is just descriptive text, so the main content is "YACHTS".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is "Hobie". The unique words in the ground truth are just "Hobie". The OCR output has "YACHTS". 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "Hobie" and "YACHTS" are completely different words. There's no overlap. Also, considering that the OCR output has "YACHTS" and the ground truth is "Hobie", there's no match. The rules mention that small typos still count, but in this case, the words are entirely different. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The OCR output has "YACHTS" which doesn't include "Hobie" at all. So the answer should be 3.
