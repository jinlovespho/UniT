gt_text: FIT
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "PARKING"- "PERMIT"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "FIT". The VLM OCR output says: "The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "PARKING"- "PERMIT"".

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output lists "PARKING" and "PERMIT" as the visible words. So the extracted text is those two words.

Now Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "FIT". The unique words in the ground truth are just "FIT". The OCR output has "PARKING" and "PERMIT". 

The comparison rules say to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "FIT" isn't in the OCR output, that's a problem. The OCR output has two words, but neither is "FIT". So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3 (Incorrect). 

Wait, the ground truth is a single word "FIT", and the OCR output has "PARKING" and "PERMIT". There's no overlap. So even if there were typos, but in this case, the words are completely different. So category 3 would be the answer here.
