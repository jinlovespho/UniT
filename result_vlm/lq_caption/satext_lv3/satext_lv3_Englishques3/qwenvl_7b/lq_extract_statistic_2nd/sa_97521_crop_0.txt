gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided the ground truth text "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output as the same. The task is to determine the category based on specific comparison rules.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "HOLLYWOOD", so that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos are still considered matches. 

The ground truth is "HOLLYWOOD", which is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. Since both are identical, even if there were minor differences like case, but here they are exactly the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOLLYWOOD" (assuming it's treated as one word). The OCR output has the same word, so all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are 1 for correct, 2 for partially correct, and 3 for incorrect. Since the OCR output matches the ground truth exactly, even if there were typos, but here there are none. Therefore, it falls under category 1.
