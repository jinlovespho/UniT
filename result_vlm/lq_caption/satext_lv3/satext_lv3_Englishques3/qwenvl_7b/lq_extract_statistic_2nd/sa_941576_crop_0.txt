gt_text: ARNOLD HAWKER HOUSE
vlm_output: ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ARNOLD HAWKER HOUSE" and the VLM OCR output is "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "ARNOLD HUNTERSCULPTOR". 

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "ARNOLD", "HAWKER", "HOUSE". 

Now, I need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "ARNOLD" and "HUNTERSCULPTOR". "ARNOLD" matches exactly, so that's one word. The other two words in the ground truth are "HAWKER" and "HOUSE". The OCR output has "HUNTERSCULPTOR" which is a single word. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output's words are "ARNOLD" and "HUNTERSCULPTOR". The ground truth's unique words are "ARNOLD", "HAWKER", "HOUSE". 

So, "ARNOLD" is a match. The other words in the OCR output don't match "HAWKER" or "HOUSE". Even if there were typos, like maybe "HUNTERSCULPTOR" could be a typo for "HAWKER" or "HOUSE", but the problem says small typos still count as matches. However, "HUNTERSCULPTOR" is not a small typo of either "HAWKER" or "HOUSE". It's a completely different word. 

Therefore, only "ARNOLD" matches. The other two words in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output. According to the categories, category 2 is "Slightly correct (partially correct): at least one but not all unique words match." Since one word matches and two don't, that would be category 2. 

Wait, but the category 1 is if all unique ground truth words appear. Here, only one does. So category 2 is correct. The answer should be 2.
