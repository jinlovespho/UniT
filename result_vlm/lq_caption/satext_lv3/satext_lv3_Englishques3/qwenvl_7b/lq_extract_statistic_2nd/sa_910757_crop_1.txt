Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "1057" and the VLM OCR output is also "1057". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "1057", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "1057".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both are just a single number. The unique words in the ground truth are just "1057" (assuming numbers are considered as words here). The OCR output has the same word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if some are present, 3 if none. Since both are the same, all unique words (just one) are present. So it should be category 1. 

Also, the note says that small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. So no issues. The answer is 1.
