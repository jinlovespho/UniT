gt_text: OXYGEN
vlm_output: OXYGEN

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OXYGEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "OXYGEN". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "OXYGEN", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both texts are exactly the same word, so order isn't an issue here.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OXYGEN". The OCR output also has "OXYGEN" as the only word. So, the unique words match perfectly.

The other considerations are ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no punctuation or spaces. So, there's nothing to adjust here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case since they are identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, this meets category 1. There's no partial correctness here because all required words are present. It's not category 2 or 3. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
