gt_text: V8T
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""END"

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "V8T". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""END""

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" and "END" as the visible words and letters. So the extracted text would be "THE" and "END".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "V8T". The unique words in the ground truth are just "V8T". The OCR output has "THE" and "END". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "V8T" isn't present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "THE" and "END", which are different from "V8T". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since there are no matches here, it should be category 3. Even though there are typos, the problem says small typos count as matches, but in this case, the words themselves are completely different. So no matches, so category 3.
