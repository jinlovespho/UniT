gt_text: User guide
vlm_output: User guide

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "User guide" and the VLM OCR output is also "User guide". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "User guide".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in reverse, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "User" and "guide". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are "User guide" with the same capitalization and spacing. So no issues there. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since both words are present and match exactly (ignoring the factors mentioned), it should be category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. So the answer should be 1.
