gt_text: KONA
vlm_output: KONA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KONA" and the VLM OCR output is also "KONA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "KONA".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly the same. 

The ground truth has the word "KONA". The OCR output is "KONA". Since they are identical, all unique words (just "KONA") from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like "konA" or "KOna", it would still count as a match because small typos are considered okay. But here, there are no typos. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be category 1.
