gt_text: ZURICH
vlm_output: 1855

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZURICH" and the VLM OCR output is "1855". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1855", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "ZURICH".

Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ZURICH". The OCR output is "1855", which is a number, not a word. 

The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "1855" is a number, not a word. The problem says to consider unique words from the ground truth. Since the OCR output doesn't contain the word "ZURICH" or any variation of it (like a typo), there's no match. 

Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there's no typo; the OCR output is entirely different. It's not even a word. So, there are no matching words. 

Therefore, according to the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth word. So the answer should be 3.
