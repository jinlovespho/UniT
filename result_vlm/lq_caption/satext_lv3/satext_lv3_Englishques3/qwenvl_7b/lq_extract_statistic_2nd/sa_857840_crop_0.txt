gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "HOLLYWOOD".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are the same word. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are all caps. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique ground truth words (just "HOLLYWOOD") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
