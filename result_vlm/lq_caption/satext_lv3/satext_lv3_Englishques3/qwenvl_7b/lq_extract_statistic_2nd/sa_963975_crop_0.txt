gt_text: AIDAstella
vlm_output: AIDA

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AIDAstella" and the VLM OCR output is "AIDA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "AIDA". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "AIDAstella". Wait, but "AIDAstella" is one word. However, the OCR output is "AIDA", which is a part of that word. 

But the categories mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "AIDAstella". The OCR output has "AIDA". Now, the question is whether "AIDA" is considered a match for "AIDAstella" considering the rules.

The rules say that small typos still count as matches. However, "AIDA" is missing the "stella" part. Is that considered a typo? Or is it a missing part? The instruction says "small typos", which might imply minor errors like misspelled letters, not missing parts of the word. For example, if the OCR had "AIDAstella" with a typo in one letter, that would be a match. But here, the OCR output is only "AIDA", which is a prefix of the ground truth word. 

But the problem says "unique words in the ground truth", so the ground truth has one word. The OCR output has one word. The comparison is whether the OCR word is a match for the ground truth word. Since "AIDA" is part of "AIDAstella", but not the full word, does that count? The rules mention that small typos count, but this is a truncation, not a typo. So maybe this isn't considered a match. 

Wait, but the instruction says "ignore extra/missing spaces". But that's about spaces, not about missing letters. So missing letters might not be considered. Therefore, "AIDA" is not a match for "AIDAstella" because it's missing part of the word. 

So the OCR output has none of the unique ground truth words (since "AIDA" isn't the same as "AIDAstella"). Therefore, the category would be 3 — Incorrect, since no words match. 

But wait, the user might consider "AIDA" as a partial match. However, according to the rules, the comparison is based on the set of unique words. Since the OCR output doesn't contain "AIDAstella", and the ground truth's unique words are only that one, then there's no match. Therefore, category 3.
