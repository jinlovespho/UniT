gt_text: HYBRID4
vlm_output: HYBRID4

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since both are the same. Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The ground truth has the word "HYBRID4" and the OCR output is the same. 

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's exactly the same, that's a match. The rules mention ignoring case, spacing, punctuation, but here they are the same. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but in this case, there's no typo. So it's a perfect match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
