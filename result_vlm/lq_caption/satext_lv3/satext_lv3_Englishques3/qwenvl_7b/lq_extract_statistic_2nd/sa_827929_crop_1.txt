gt_text: EEN 1-125
vlm_output: PILGRIM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EEN 1-125" and the VLM OCR output is "PILGRIM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "PILGRIM".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "EEN" and "1-125". The OCR output is "PILGRIM", which is a single word. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has only one word. The categories are based on whether all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "PILGRIM" doesn't contain "EEN" or "1-125", even if we ignore case, spacing, etc., there's no match. 

Even if there were typos, the OCR output has completely different words. So, no words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it falls under category 3—Incorrect.
