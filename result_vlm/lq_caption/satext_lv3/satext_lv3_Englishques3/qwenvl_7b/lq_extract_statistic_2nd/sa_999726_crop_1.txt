gt_text: PINKO
vlm_output: PINKO

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PINKO" and the VLM OCR output is also "PINKO". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "PINKO", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here. 

Next, the comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PINKO". The OCR output also has the same word. 

The guidelines say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either. 

Regarding typos, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. But since the OCR output is identical to the ground truth, there are no typos to consider. 

Looking at the categories: 
- Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both have "PINKO" and it's the only word, this fits perfectly. 
- Categories 2 and 3 don't apply here because there's a full match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
