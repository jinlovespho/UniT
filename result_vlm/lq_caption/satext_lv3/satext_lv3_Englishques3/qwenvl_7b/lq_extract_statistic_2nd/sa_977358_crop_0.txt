gt_text: l'Orangerie Musée de
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```SUN```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "l'Orangerie Musée de" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```SUN```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```SUN```". The actual text here is "SUN" enclosed in backticks. So the extracted text is just "SUN".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: "l'", "Orangerie", "Musée", "de". Let me break them down into unique words. The words in the ground truth are "l'", "Orangerie", "Musée", and "de". 

Now, the OCR output is "SUN". Let's check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The word "SUN" doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. Even if I consider typos, "SUN" isn't a typo of any of the ground truth words. The ground truth words are in French, and "SUN" is an English word. There's no overlap in the words. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but in this case, the OCR output has none of the words from the ground truth. Also, we're supposed to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has no matching words, even considering typos, it doesn't match any. 

So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
