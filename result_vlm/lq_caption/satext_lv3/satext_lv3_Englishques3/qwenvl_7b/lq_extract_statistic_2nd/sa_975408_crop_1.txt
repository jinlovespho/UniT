gt_text: F154 3
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```W```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "F154 3", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```W```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The visible text in the image is:```W```". So the actual text here is "W" enclosed in backticks. But maybe the OCR is trying to say that the visible text is "W"? Or is there more? The way it's written, the part after the colon is the content, which is "W" with backticks, but maybe the backticks are just formatting and the actual text is just "W".

Now, the ground truth has "F154 3". Let's look at the unique words here. The ground truth has two words: "F154" and "3". The OCR output's extracted text is "W". 

Comparing these, "W" doesn't match either "F154" or "3". Even if we consider typos, "W" isn't similar to either of those words. The OCR output has no words that are present in the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
