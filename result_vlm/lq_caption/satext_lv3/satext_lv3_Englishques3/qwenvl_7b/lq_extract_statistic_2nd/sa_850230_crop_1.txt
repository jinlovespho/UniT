gt_text: XIV SEC.
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"FRANCE"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "XIV SEC." and a VLM OCR output that says "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"FRANCE"". 

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"FRANCE"". So, the actual text extracted would be "FRANCE" because that's what's in quotes. The rest of the sentence is probably the system's description, but the actual OCR result is "FRANCE".

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "XIV SEC." Let's break down the requirements for the comparison:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has two words: "XIV" and "SEC". The OCR output is "FRANCE", which is a single word. Now, I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "XIV" and "SEC" versus "FRANCE". There's no overlap. "FRANCE" doesn't contain "XIV" or "SEC" even if we consider typos. For example, "XIV" is a Roman numeral for 14, and "SEC" could be short for "section" or "security". "FRANCE" is a country name, so there's no way it's a typo for either of those words. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Not the case here.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But here, none match, so it's not this.
- Category 3: No words match or output is wrong/unrelated. This fits because the OCR output is "FRANCE", which is unrelated to "XIV SEC."

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
