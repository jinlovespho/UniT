gt_text: Bell
vlm_output: Bell

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bell" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bell". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Bell".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it would still count. But here, both are exactly the same word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bell". The OCR output also has "Bell". So the set of unique words matches exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are just "Bell", so no issues there. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since both are the same, it's a correct match. So the answer should be 1.
