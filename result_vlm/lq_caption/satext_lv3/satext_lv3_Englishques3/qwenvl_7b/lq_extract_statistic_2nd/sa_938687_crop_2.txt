Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the output is just "1", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "1". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the conditions: ignoring case, spacing, punctuation, and typos. Since both are "1", there's no issue here. Even if there were a typo, like "l" instead of "1", but that's not the case here. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words match, which they do here. 
So the answer should be category 1.
