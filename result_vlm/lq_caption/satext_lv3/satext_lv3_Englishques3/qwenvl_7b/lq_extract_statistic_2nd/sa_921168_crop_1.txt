gt_text: CENTURY PARK HOTEL
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```HOTEL```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "CENTURY PARK HOTEL". The OCR output from the VLM is "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "HOTEL".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: CENTURY, PARK, HOTEL. The OCR output only has HOTEL. 

The rules say word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are CENTURY, PARK, HOTEL. The OCR output has HOTEL. 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. The OCR output's HOTEL is in uppercase, same as in the ground truth. No typos here. But the OCR missed CENTURY and PARK. 

The category is determined by how many unique words match. Since only one out of three words (HOTEL) matches, that's at least one but not all. So according to the categories, this would be category 2: Slightly correct (partially correct). 

Wait, but the instructions say "unique words in the ground truth". So the ground truth has three unique words. The OCR output has one of them. So at least one matches, but not all. So category 2 applies. Even though the OCR output is a subset of the ground truth words, it's not all. So the answer should be 2.
