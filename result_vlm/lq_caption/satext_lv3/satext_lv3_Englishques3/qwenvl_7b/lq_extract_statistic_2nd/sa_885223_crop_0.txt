gt_text: JHS
vlm_output: jīs

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "JHS" and the VLM OCR output is "jīs". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "jīs". Now, comparing this with the ground truth "JHS".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three characters: J, H, S. But wait, are they considered as separate words or as a single word? The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If "JHS" is considered as one word, then the OCR output "jīs" is a single word. But the ground truth's unique words would be just "JHS" as one word. However, the OCR output is "jīs", which is a different word. But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the same as the ground truth, but with possible typos.

Wait, the ground truth is "JHS", which is three uppercase letters. The OCR output is "jīs", which is lowercase 'j', then a diacritic mark (ī), and then 's'. So maybe the OCR made a mistake in recognizing the second character. The ground truth has 'H' as the second character, but the OCR output has 'ī' which is a different character. However, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. But is 'ī' considered a typo of 'H'? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the same letters but with different diacritics or something. 

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "JHS" as one word. The OCR output is "jīs", which is a different word. However, the instruction says to ignore capitalization. So "jīs" would be compared to "JHS" by ignoring case. But "jīs" is not the same as "JHS" even when ignoring case. The letters are different. The second character in the ground truth is 'H' (uppercase or lowercase), but the OCR has 'ī', which is a different letter with a diacritic. So that's not a typo of 'H'. So maybe there's no match here. 

But the problem says that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output is not just a typo but a completely different character. So perhaps there's no match. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "JHS", and the OCR output is "jīs", which is a different word. So category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. 

Alternatively, if the ground truth is considered as three separate letters (J, H, S), then the OCR output has 'j', 'ī', 's'. The 'j' and 's' would match J and S if we ignore case, but the 'ī' is not H. So maybe two out of three letters match? But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "JHS" as a single word, then the OCR output's "jīs" is not a match. If the ground truth is considered as three separate words (J, H, S), then the OCR output has 'j', 'ī', 's' which would have two matches (j and s) but 'ī' is not H. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth's unique words are J, H, S (assuming they are separate), then the OCR output has j, ī, s. So j matches J, s matches S, but ī doesn't match H. So two out of three words match. But the category is based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. If the ground truth has three unique words, and the OCR output has two matches, then it's partially correct (category 2). 

Wait, but the problem says "the set of unique words in the ground truth". If the ground truth is "JHS", that's one word. So the set is {"JHS"}. The OCR output is "jīs", which is a different word. So no match. Hence, category 3. 

Alternatively, if the ground truth is considered as three letters, but the problem says "unique words", so words are separated by spaces. Since the ground truth is "JHS" with no spaces, it's one word. The OCR output is "jīs", one word. So comparing the two words, ignoring case, but they are different. Hence, no match. So category 3. 

But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the same letters but with a typo. For example, if the OCR output was "jhs", that would be a match. But in this case, it's "jīs", which is a different character. So no match. Therefore, the answer is 3.
