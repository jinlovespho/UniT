Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Instagram" and the VLM OCR output is also "Instagram". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria provided.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Instagram", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is just "Instagram", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "Instagram", so the unique words are the same.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The original text is all caps, but the OCR output is the same. However, even if there were differences in case, like "instagram" vs "Instagram", they would be considered the same. But here, both are exactly the same.
- Small typos still count as matches. If there was a typo, like "Instagarm", it would still count. But in this case, there are no typos.

Now, looking at the categories:

Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("Instagram") and the OCR output has the same, this condition is met.

Category 2 is for partial matches, but since all words match, this isn't applicable here.

Category 3 is for no matches or largely wrong outputs. That's not the case here.

Therefore, the answer should be category 1. The OCR output perfectly matches the ground truth according to all the given criteria.
