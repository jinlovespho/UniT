gt_text: KENDA
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```UNI```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "KENDA" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```UNI```". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "UNI" is the visible text. So the extracted text is "UNI".

Next, step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "KENDA". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The ground truth has one unique word: "KENDA". The OCR output has "UNI". Now, checking if "UNI" matches "KENDA" considering the rules. Since the problem says small typos still count as matches, but "UNI" and "KENDA" are different in letters. There's no overlap in letters here. Even if we ignore case, "uni" vs "kenda" are different. Also, the number of letters is different (3 vs 5). So there's no match. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect.
