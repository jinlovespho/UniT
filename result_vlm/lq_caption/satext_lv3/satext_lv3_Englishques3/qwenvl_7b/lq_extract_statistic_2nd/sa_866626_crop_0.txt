gt_text: RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "RUELLE SAINTE CARRUCETU DEVOTE DEVOTA SANTA". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100""

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a bit confusing. It starts with "The visible English words and letters in the image are:" followed by "100" in quotes. So the actual text extracted would be "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 100". But maybe the OCR output is just the part after the colon? Wait, the user wrote the OCR output as "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100""

Wait, maybe the OCR output is the entire string, including the colon and the "100" part. So the extracted text is "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 100". But that seems like it's not matching the ground truth at all. The ground truth is in French, with words like RUELLE, SAINTE, etc., while the OCR output is in English and mentions numbers.

Now, step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are: RUELLE, SAINTE, CARRUCETU, DEVOTE, DEVOTA, SANTA. So those are the six unique words. Now, the OCR output's text is "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 100". Let's break this down into words: The, visible, English, words, and, letters, in, the, image, are, 100. So the words here are all English, and there's a number 100. 

Now, comparing these words to the ground truth's words. None of the OCR words (The, visible, English, words, etc.) are present in the ground truth. The ground truth words are all in French, and the OCR output is in English. Also, the OCR output mentions "100", which is a number, not a word. So there's no overlap in the unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 2 if at least one but not all. 3 if none match or the output is wrong. Since none of the OCR's words match the ground truth's unique words, the category would be 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Even though the OCR output might have "words" which is a common word, but in the ground truth, the words are specific French terms. So "words" isn't one of the unique ground truth words. Therefore, the answer is 3.
