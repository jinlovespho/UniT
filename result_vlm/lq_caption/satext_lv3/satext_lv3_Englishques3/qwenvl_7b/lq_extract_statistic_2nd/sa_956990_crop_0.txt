gt_text: Steelers
vlm_output: Steelers

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Steelers" and the VLM OCR output is also "Steelers". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Steelers".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are just one word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Steelers". The OCR output also has "Steelers". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of capitalization (all caps?), but the original ground truth is "Steelers" which is capitalized, and the OCR output is the same. So no issues there. No punctuation or spaces to consider here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
