gt_text: BOSS HUGO BOSS
vlm_output: BOSS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BOSS HUGO BOSS" and the VLM OCR output is "BOSS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "BOSS". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are "BOSS" and "HUGO". 

The OCR output has "BOSS" but not "HUGO". The categories are based on whether all unique words from the ground truth are present. Since the OCR output is missing "HUGO", that means not all unique words are there. But it does have one of them. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or mostly wrong. Here, since one word matches but not all, it should be category 2. Even though the OCR output has "BOSS" which is in the ground truth, the missing "HUGO" means it's not fully correct. So the answer is 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 135
2. Slightly Correct Num: 70
3. Incorrect Num: 358
