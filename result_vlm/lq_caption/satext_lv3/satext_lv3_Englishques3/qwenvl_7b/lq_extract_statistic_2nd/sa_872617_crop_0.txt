gt_text: 40 40
vlm_output: 40

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40 40" and the VLM OCR output is "40". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "40". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two instances of "40", but the OCR output has one. But since we're looking at unique words, the ground truth's unique words are just {"40"}. The OCR output's unique words are also {"40"}. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Even though the OCR output has fewer instances, the category is based on unique words. So even if the OCR output has one "40" instead of two, since the unique set matches, it's category 1. Also, the other conditions like ignoring case, spacing, etc., don't affect this because both are just "40". No typos here. So the answer should be 1.
