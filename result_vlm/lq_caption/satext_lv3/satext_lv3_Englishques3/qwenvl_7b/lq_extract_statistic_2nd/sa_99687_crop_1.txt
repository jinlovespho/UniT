gt_text: ABB
vlm_output: ABB

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "ABB" and the VLM OCR output is also "ABB". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "ABB", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. The word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But since both are "ABB", the order is the same.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ABB". The OCR output also has "ABB". So the unique words match perfectly.

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, both are all caps with no spaces or punctuation. So no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same unique word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
