gt_text: BEER
vlm_output: BEER

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BEER" and the VLM OCR output is also "BEER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BEER".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BEER". The OCR output also has "BEER". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's the same. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's none. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words are present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
