gt_text: OVO
vlm_output: OVO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OVO" and the VLM OCR output is also "OVO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "OVO".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OVO". The OCR output also has "OVO". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So the categories are: 1 if all unique words match. Since both have the same single word, it's a correct match. Therefore, category 1.
