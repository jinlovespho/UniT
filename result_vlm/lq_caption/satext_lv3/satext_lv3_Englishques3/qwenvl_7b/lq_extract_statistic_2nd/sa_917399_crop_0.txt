gt_text: SMOKING
vlm_output: SMOKING

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SMOKING" and the VLM OCR output is also "SMOKING". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "SMOKING".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SMOKING". The OCR output also has "SMOKING". 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring capitalization, but both are all caps, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here because they are identical. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since both are the same, it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
