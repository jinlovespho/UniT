gt_text: BEACH ALLOWED
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```100```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BEACH ALLOWED", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```100```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```100```". The actual text that's extracted would be "100" because the rest is just a description. So the extracted text is "100".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BEACH" and "ALLOWED". The OCR output has "100", which is a number. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words "BEACH" or "ALLOWED". It's just the number 100. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just a complete mismatch. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the required words. 

So, according to the categories: Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "100" isn't related to "BEACH" or "ALLOWED", this should be category 3.
