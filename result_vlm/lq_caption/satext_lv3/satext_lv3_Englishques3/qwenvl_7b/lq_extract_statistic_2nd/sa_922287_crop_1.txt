Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMBULANCE 13-110", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:- 'CITY'- 'BUS'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "CITY" and "BUS". So the extracted words are "CITY" and "BUS".

Next, compare these with the ground truth. The ground truth has "AMBULANCE" and "13-110". Now, the instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "AMBULANCE" and "13-110". 

The OCR output has "CITY" and "BUS", which are different from the ground truth words. None of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words. Even if I consider typos, there's no overlap. The numbers in the ground truth are "13-110", but the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
