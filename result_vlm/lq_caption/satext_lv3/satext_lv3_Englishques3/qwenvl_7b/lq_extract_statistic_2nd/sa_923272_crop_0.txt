Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "BOSS HUGO BOSS" and the OCR output is "BOSSHUGO BOSS". I need to compare these according to the steps given.

First, extract the text from OCR: "BOSSHUGO BOSS". Then, compare with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter. The unique words in ground truth are "BOSS" and "HUGO". 

Now, looking at the OCR output. The first part is "BOSSHUGO" which seems like a typo. If I ignore capitalization and spacing, maybe "BOSSHUGO" is intended to be "BOSS HUGO" but merged into one word. The second part is "BOSS" which is correct.

So, the OCR has "BOSS" (correct) and "BOSSHUGO" (which might be a typo for "HUGO BOSS" but since we're looking for unique words in ground truth, "HUGO" is the other word. However, the OCR doesn't have "HUGO" as a separate word. Instead, it has "BOSSHUGO", which is a merged version. But the problem says small typos still count as matches. Wait, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "BOSS" and "HUGO". The OCR output has "BOSSHUGO" and "BOSS". 

Now, does "BOSSHUGO" count as containing "HUGO"? If we consider that the OCR might have merged "BOSS" and "HUGO" into one word, but the ground truth has them as separate. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR needs to have both "BOSS" and "HUGO" as words, but in the OCR output, "BOSSHUGO" is one word. So "HUGO" isn't present as a separate word. Therefore, the OCR output has "BOSS" (correct) and "BOSSHUGO" (which is a typo but maybe considered as containing "HUGO" if we split it, but the instruction says to compare based on unique words in ground truth. Since "HUGO" is not present as a separate word in the OCR output, only "BOSS" is present. So that would mean only one of the two unique ground truth words is present. Therefore, category 2: partially correct. But wait, the instruction says small typos still count as matches. So maybe "BOSSHUGO" is considered a typo of "BOSS HUGO", so it's considered as having both "BOSS" and "HUGO"? But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the OCR output's words are "BOSSHUGO" and "BOSS", then "BOSS" is present, but "HUGO" is not. Unless the system allows splitting the merged word into parts. But the instructions don't mention splitting words. So maybe the answer is category 2, since only "BOSS" is present. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, if the OCR output is considered as "BOSS HUGO" (with a space) but it's merged into "BOSSHUGO", but the typo is small. However, the instructions state that small typos still count as matches. So maybe "BOSSHUGO" is considered as "BOSS HUGO" with a typo (missing space), so it's a match for the words "BOSS" and "HUGO". But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the OCR output has "BOSSHUGO" as a single word, but "HUGO" is part of that word, does that count? The instructions don't mention splitting words, so I think the answer is category 2, because only "BOSS" is present as a word, and "HUGO" is not. Therefore, category 2.
