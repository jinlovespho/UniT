gt_text: LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY
vlm_output: LIBRARY GALLERY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "LEEDS LIBRARY GALLERY LIBRARY". So the unique words here are "LEEDS", "LIBRARY", and "GALLERY". The OCR output is "LIBRARY GALLERY".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here: "LIBRARY GALLERY".

Now, comparing the sets. The ground truth has three unique words: LEEDS, LIBRARY, GALLERY. The OCR output has two: LIBRARY and GALLERY. So, the OCR output is missing "LEEDS". 

But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output has two out of three words. Since word order doesn't matter, and we ignore case, etc., the OCR has "LIBRARY" and "GALLERY" which are present in the ground truth. But "LEEDS" is missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or mostly wrong. Here, two out of three words are present. So that's partially correct, which would be category 2. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "LIBRARY" twice, but in the unique set, it's just once. So the OCR has "LIBRARY" once, which is still a match. So the OCR has two unique words matching (LIBRARY and GALLERY), but missing LEEDS. So that's at least one but not all. So category 2. 

I think that's correct. The answer should be 2.
