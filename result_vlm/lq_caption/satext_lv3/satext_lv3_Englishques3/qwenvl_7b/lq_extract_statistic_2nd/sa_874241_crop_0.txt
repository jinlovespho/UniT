gt_text: Rai
vlm_output: Rai

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rai" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rai". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Rai".

Next step is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are the same word, order isn't an issue here. Then, we need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rai". The OCR output also has "Rai". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means it falls under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
