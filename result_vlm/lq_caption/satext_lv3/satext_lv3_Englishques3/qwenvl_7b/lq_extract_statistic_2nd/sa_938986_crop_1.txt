gt_text: Mercure Mercure
vlm_output: Mercure

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Mercure Mercure", which means the unique word here is "Mercure" (since it's repeated, but we only consider unique words). The VLM OCR output is "Mercure".

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward, it's just "Mercure".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are {"Mercure"}. The OCR output has "Mercure" as well. Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so even if the OCR had the words in a different order, it would still count. But here, the OCR has exactly the same word. Also, ignoring capitalization and spacing. Since both are lowercase (though the original might have been capitalized, but the comparison is case-insensitive), and there's no punctuation or extra spaces. The OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth's unique set. Even if there were typos, like "Mercure" vs "Mercure", but in this case, they are the same. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Therefore, it's category 1.
