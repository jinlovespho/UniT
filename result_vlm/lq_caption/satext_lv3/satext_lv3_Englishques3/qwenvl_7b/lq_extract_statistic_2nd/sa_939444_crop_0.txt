gt_text: PRESIDE DE
vlm_output: SUNSET

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PRESIDE DE" and the OCR output is "SUNSET". I need to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output, which is "SUNSET". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "PRESIDE" and "DE". The OCR output has "SUNSET", which is one word. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we just check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But the ground truth words are "PRESIDE" and "DE". The OCR output is "SUNSET", which doesn't have either of those words. Even if I ignore capitalization, "PRESIDE" vs "preside" or "DE" vs "de", the OCR output has completely different words. There's no overlap. Also, typos are considered matches if they are small, but here the words are entirely different. So no words match. 

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it should be category 3.
