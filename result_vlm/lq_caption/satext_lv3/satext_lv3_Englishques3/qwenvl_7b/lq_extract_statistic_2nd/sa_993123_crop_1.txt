gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: HSBC

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC". The OCR output has the same word. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that means it's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
