gt_text: AMP
vlm_output: AMP

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "AMP", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the comparison. But in this case, both are exactly "AMP".

Now, considering the criteria: we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has one unique word: "AMP". The OCR output also has "AMP". 

The comparison should ignore case, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos since they're identical. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match.
