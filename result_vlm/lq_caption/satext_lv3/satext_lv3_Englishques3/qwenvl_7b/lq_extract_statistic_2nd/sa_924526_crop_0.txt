gt_text: Hilton
vlm_output: Hilton

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "Hilton" and a VLM OCR output of "Hilton". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. In this case, the OCR output is exactly "Hilton", so the extracted text is straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, it's just the word "Hilton". The OCR output is also "Hilton". Since both are the same word, there's no issue with word order, capitalization, or spacing. There are no typos here either because the words are identical. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word, "Hilton", and the OCR output has the same word, this meets the criteria for category 1. 

I don't see any other words involved, so there's no partial match (category 2) or no match (category 3). The output is exactly correct, so the answer should be category 1.
