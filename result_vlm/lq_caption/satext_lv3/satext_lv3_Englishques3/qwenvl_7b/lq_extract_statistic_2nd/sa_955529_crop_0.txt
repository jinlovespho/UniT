gt_text: verbal
vlm_output: verbal

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "verbal" and the VLM OCR output is also "verbal". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "verbal", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same single word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "verbal". The OCR output also has "verbal". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are lowercase, have no punctuation, and no extra spaces. There's no typo here since they are identical.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, all unique words (just "verbal") are present. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
