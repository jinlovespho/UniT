Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "easyJet" and a VLM OCR output of "easyJet". They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "easyJet", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both the ground truth and OCR output are the same word: "easyJet".

Next, the comparison should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet". The OCR output also has the same word. 

The rules also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. However, in this case, both texts are identical in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either.

Regarding typos, the note says small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not an issue. 

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both have the same single word, this should be a Category 1. 

I need to make sure there's no oversight. The OCR output isn't missing any words, and there's no extra or missing words. Even if there were typos, like "easyjEt", it would still count as a match because the rule says small typos are acceptable. But here, the OCR is exactly correct. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 1.
