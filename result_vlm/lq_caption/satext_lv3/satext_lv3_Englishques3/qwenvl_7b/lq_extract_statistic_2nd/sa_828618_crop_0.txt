gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "BUT".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT". The OCR output also has "BUT". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are uppercase, but even if one was lowercase, it would still match because we ignore case. There's no punctuation or extra spaces here. Also, small typos are considered matches. But there are no typos in this case.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, that would be category 1: Correct. Because all unique words are present, even if there were typos, but here there are none. So the answer should be 1.
