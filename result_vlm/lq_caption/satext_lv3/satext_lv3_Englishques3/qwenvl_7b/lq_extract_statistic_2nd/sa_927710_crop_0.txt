vlm_output: KAKAOKEKSENEU81%

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPORT NEU Ritter KAKAO 81 KLASSE STARKE GHANA DIE AUS KAKAO MIT %", and the VLM OCR output is "KAKAOKEKSENEU81%". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "KAKAOKEKSENEU81%". Now, the next step is to compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified conditions.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me list the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has: SPORT, NEU, Ritter, KAKAO, 81, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, %. Wait, but the ground truth includes "KAKAO" twice, but as a unique word, it's just once. Also, the percentage sign is there as a separate element.

Now, the OCR output is "KAKAOKEKSENEU81%". Let's break this down. The OCR output has "KAKAOKEKS" which might be a typo for "KAKAO" and "KEKSE" (which is German for cookies, but not in the ground truth). Then "NEU", "81%", and maybe "EU" as part of "NEU" or "EU" as a separate term. Wait, but the OCR output is "KAKAOKEKSENEU81%". Let me parse this. 

Breaking it down: KAKAOKEKSENEU81%. Let's split into possible words. "KAKAO" is definitely there. Then "KEKSE" (cookies), "NEU" (new), "81%", and maybe "EU" if there's a split. However, the ground truth has "NEU", "KAKAO", "81%", and possibly others. Let me check the unique words again. The ground truth's unique words are: SPORT, NEU, Ritter, KAKAO, 81, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, %.

The OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", "81%", and maybe "KEKSE" which isn't in the ground truth. The other words in the ground truth like Ritter, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, SPORT, % (though the % is present in the OCR as part of 81%). Wait, the ground truth has a %, and the OCR has "81%", so that's matching the % as part of 81%. But the ground truth has "KAKAO" and "KAKAO" again, but as unique words, it's still counted once. 

So the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", "81%", and "KEKSE" (which is not in the ground truth). The other words in the ground truth like Ritter, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, SPORT are not present in the OCR output. 

So the unique words from the ground truth that are present in the OCR output are "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%" (since the % is included in the OCR's 81%). However, the ground truth has "KAKAO" and "81" (as a number) and "%", but the OCR has "81%", which combines both. But according to the instructions, small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR's "81%" includes both the number and the percentage, which might be considered as matching "81" and "%" from the ground truth. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "81" and "%", but the OCR has "81%", which is a single token. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, so maybe "81%" is considered as containing "81" and "%", but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the ground truth has "81" and "%" as separate elements. The OCR output has "81%", which is a single token. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if "81" and "%" are separate words in the ground truth, but the OCR has them combined as "81%", does that count as matching both? Or is "81%" considered a different token? 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not to split tokens. So "81%" is a single token in the OCR, while the ground truth has "81" and "%" as separate tokens. Therefore, the OCR's "81%" would not exactly match "81" and "%", but since small typos count, maybe it's considered as a match for "81" and "%". However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output has "81%", does that count as containing "81" and "%" as separate words? 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's "81%" is considered as containing both "81" and "%" because of the instruction to ignore extra/missing spaces. But I'm not sure. Let's think again. 

The ground truth has "81" and "%", but the OCR has "81%". If the OCR output is considered as having "81" and "%", then that would match. However, if the OCR output is considered as a single token "81%", then it doesn't match the ground truth's "81" and "%". But the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, so maybe "81%" is considered as "81%" which includes both the number and the percentage, but since the ground truth has "81" and "%", maybe it's considered as a partial match. 

But the problem states that small typos still count as matches. However, "81%" is not a typo of "81" and "%", but rather a combination. So perhaps the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%" which may be considered as containing "81" and "%", but the exact words in the ground truth are "81" and "%", so if the OCR has "81%", does that count as matching both? 

This is tricky. Let me recheck the instructions. It says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in the ground truth are: SPORT, NEU, Ritter, KAKAO, 81, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, %. 

The OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%". The "81%" may not be exactly matching "81" and "%", but if we consider that the OCR output has "81" and "%" as parts of the token, but the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not to split tokens. Therefore, "81%" is a single token, which doesn't exactly match "81" or "%", but perhaps it's considered as a typo for "81%" which is not in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth has "81" and "%", so maybe the OCR's "81%" is a combination that includes both, but the problem is whether the OCR's output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. 

In this case, the OCR output has "KAKAO" (which is present), "NEU" (present), and "81%" (which may not be present as "81" and "%" are separate). Therefore, the OCR output has two of the unique words from the ground truth. However, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. But "81%" is not a typo of "81" or "%", but a combination. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's "81%" is considered as containing both "81" and "%" because of the instruction to ignore extra/missing spaces. But that's not necessarily correct. For example, if the ground truth had "81%", and the OCR had "81" and "%", that would be a match. But the reverse isn't clear. 

In this case, the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%", which may not fully match the ground truth's unique words. The ground truth has "KAKAO", "NEU", "81", "%", and others. The OCR has "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%", which might be considered as containing "81" and "%" as parts. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. If "81%" is not one of the unique words in the ground truth, then it's not a match. The ground truth has "81" and "%" as separate words. 

Therefore, the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", and "81%", which may not include "81" and "%" as separate words. Therefore, the OCR output has two words ("KAKAO" and "NEU") that match the ground truth, and "81%" which may not be considered as matching both "81" and "%". Thus, the unique words from the ground truth that are present in the OCR output are "KAKAO" and "NEU". 

The ground truth has more unique words (like Ritter, KLASSE, STARKE, GHANA, DIE, AUS, MIT, SPORT, %). So the OCR output has only two of them. Since the category is 1 if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, which they don't. Category 2 is if at least one but not all. Since two are present, that would be category 2. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "81" and "%" as separate words. The OCR output has "81%", which is a single token. If we consider that "81%" contains "81" and "%" as parts, then maybe that counts as matching both. But the problem states that small typos count as matches. However, "81%" is not a typo of "81" or "%", but a combination. Therefore, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR's "81%" is considered as containing "81" and "%" because of the instruction to ignore extra/missing spaces. For example, if the ground truth has "81" and "%", and the OCR has "81%", which is a combination, maybe it's considered as containing both. 

If that's the case, then the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", "81", and "%", which are four of the ground truth's unique words. Then, the other words in the ground truth are not present. So the OCR output has some matches but not all. Therefore, category 2. 

But this is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether "81%" is considered as containing "81" and "%". If yes, then the OCR output has "KAKAO", "NEU", "81", and "%", which are four of the ground truth's unique words. However, the ground truth also has "Ritter", "KLASSE", "STARKE", "GHANA", "DIE", "AUS", "MIT", and "SPORT", which are not present in the OCR output. Therefore, the OCR output has some matches but not all, so category 2. 

Alternatively, if "81%" is not considered as containing "81" and "%", then the OCR output has only "KAKAO" and "NEU", which are two of the unique words. Either way, it's not all, so category 2. 

Therefore, the answer is category 2.
