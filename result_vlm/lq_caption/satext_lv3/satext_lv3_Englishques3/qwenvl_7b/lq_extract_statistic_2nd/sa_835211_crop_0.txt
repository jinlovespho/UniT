gt_text: SWITCH NINTENDO
vlm_output: NINTENDO SWITCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SWITCH NINTENDO" and the VLM OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". The task is to determine the category based on the comparison steps provided.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so "NINTENDO SWITCH" and "SWITCH NINTENDO" are considered the same. 

Next, checking the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "SWITCH" and "NINTENDO". The OCR output also has the same two words, just in reverse order. The comparison should ignore case, but both are uppercase here. There are no typos mentioned, so "NINTENDO" and "SWITCH" in the OCR match exactly. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. The category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present, which they are here. So the answer is 1.
