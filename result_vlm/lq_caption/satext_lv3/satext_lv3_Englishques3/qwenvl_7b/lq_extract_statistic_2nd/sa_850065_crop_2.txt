gt_text: maje
vlm_output: maje

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "maje" and the VLM OCR output is also "maje". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "maje", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are just one word: "maje". So the order isn't an issue here.

The comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "maje". The OCR output also has "maje". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are lowercase and have no punctuation or spaces. So they match exactly in that regard.

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, all unique words from the ground truth ("maje") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be Category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
