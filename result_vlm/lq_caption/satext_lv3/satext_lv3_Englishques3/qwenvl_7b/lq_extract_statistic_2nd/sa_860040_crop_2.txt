Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "861 11940" and the VLM OCR output is "AMBULANCE". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "AMBULANCE". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth text. The ground truth has two numbers: "861" and "11940". 

Now, looking at the comparison rules. The key points are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

But wait, the ground truth is numerical, and the OCR output is a word. The ground truth words are "861" and "11940", which are numbers. The OCR output is "AMBULANCE", which is a word. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "861" and "11940". The OCR output has the word "AMBULANCE". Now, the question is whether "AMBULANCE" matches any of the ground truth words when considering the rules.

But the problem is that "AMBULANCE" is a word, and the ground truth words are numbers. There's no overlap here. Even if we ignore case, the OCR output is "AMBULANCE" which is not a number. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but that's for letters, not numbers. Also, the OCR output doesn't have any numbers. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are numbers, and the OCR output has a word that's not a number. Therefore, there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth. 

According to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, none do.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But there are zero matches.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
