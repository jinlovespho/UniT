gt_text: XCELSIOR
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "XCELSIOR", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So the extracted text would be "The visible text in the image is: 1". I need to ignore any formatting like the backticks around the 1, so it's just the text "The visible text in the image is: 1".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors. The key points are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "XCELSIOR". Let's break that down. The word "XCELSIOR" is a single word. However, it's possible that it's a typo or a specific term. Let me check if "XCELSIOR" is a known word. Wait, "Xcel" might be a typo for "Excel", and "sior" could be part of "sior" or maybe "sior" is a typo for "sior" (but that's not a common word). Alternatively, maybe "XCELSIOR" is intended to be "Xcel Sior" or "Xcel Sior" as separate words? But the original is written as one word.

But according to the problem, the unique words in the ground truth are considered. Since the ground truth is "XCELSIOR", which is one word. So the unique words are just ["XCELSIOR"].

Now, the OCR output is "The visible text in the image is: 1". Let's extract the words here. The words are: "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "1". But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has only one unique word: "XCELSIOR".

Now, we need to check if any of the OCR output's words match the ground truth word, considering the given rules. The OCR output's words are all in lowercase except "The" which is capitalized, but we can ignore capitalization. However, the ground truth word is "XCELSIOR", which is all caps. Let's check if any of the OCR words, when normalized (lowercase, ignoring punctuation, spaces), match "XCELSIOR".

The OCR output's words are: "the", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "1". None of these words are "xcelisor" or similar. The number "1" is not a word. So there's no match between the OCR output's words and the ground truth's unique word "XCELSIOR".

Therefore, according to the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, the ground truth has one unique word, which is not present in the OCR output.

2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match. But in this case, there are zero matches.

3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since the OCR output doesn't have any matching words, this falls into category 3.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the ground truth. The ground truth is "XCELSIOR", which might be a typo for "XCEL SIOR" (two words) or "XCELSIOR" as a single word. However, the problem states that the unique words in the ground truth are considered. If "XCELSIOR" is considered as a single word, then there's no match. If it's a typo for "XCEL SIOR", then the OCR output has "text" and "image", which still don't match. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is supposed to capture "XCELSIOR" as "1", but that seems like a stretch. The OCR output says "1" which is a number, not a word. So even if "XCELSIOR" is a typo for "XCEL" (as in Excel), the OCR output has "text" and "image", which still don't match.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
