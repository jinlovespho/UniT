gt_text: 131 BEAT 艺术空间
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""END"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "131 BEAT 艺术空间". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""END"\". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" and "END" as the visible English words. So the extracted text would be "THE END".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "131", "BEAT", and "艺术空间". Wait, but the OCR output only has "THE" and "END". The problem says to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are "131", "BEAT", and "艺术空间". However, the OCR output has "THE" and "END", which are not present in the ground truth. 

But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth words are "131", "BEAT", and "艺术空间". The OCR output has "THE" and "END", which are not any of those. Therefore, none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth, it's category 3. 

Wait, but the OCR output is in English, and the ground truth has a mix of numbers, English, and Chinese. The OCR output's words "THE" and "END" are English, but the ground truth's English words are "BEAT". "THE" and "END" don't match "BEAT" even with typos. So no matches. Hence, category 3.
