gt_text: LMK 424
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"Mercedes-Benz"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LMK 424" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English word in the image is:Mercedes-Benz". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible English word in the image is:Mercedes-Benz". So the actual text here is "Mercedes-Benz" after the colon. But the ground truth is "LMK 424". 

Now, comparing the extracted text "Mercedes-Benz" with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "LMK" and "424". The OCR output has "Mercedes-Benz" which is a single word. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "LMK" and "424". The OCR output has "Mercedes-Benz" which is not present in the ground truth. So there are no matches here. 

Even if I consider typos, but "Mercedes-Benz" isn't related to "LMK" or "424". Also, the category says if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
