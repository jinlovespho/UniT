gt_text: PILOTS
vlm_output: PILOTS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PILOTS" and the VLM OCR output is also "PILOTS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "PILOTS", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "PILOTS".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PILOTS" (since it's a single word). The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, typos. Since both are exactly the same, even though the problem mentions typos, there are none here. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's matched exactly, the answer should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The OCR output is correct.
