gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: QATAR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "QATAR". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "QATAR".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "QATAR". The OCR output also has "QATAR". 

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be category 1.
