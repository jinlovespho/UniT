Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "3" and the VLM OCR output is also "3". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "3".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly "3". 

The ground truth has one unique word, which is "3". The OCR output also has "3". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if all unique words match, it's category 1. There's no issue here. The output isn't missing any words, and there's no typos or other issues. So the answer should be 1.
