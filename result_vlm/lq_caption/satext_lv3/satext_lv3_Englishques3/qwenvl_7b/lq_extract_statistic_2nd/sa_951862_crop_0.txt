gt_text: 154 T

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "154 T" and the VLM OCR output is "154". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "154", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "154" and "T". The OCR output only has "154". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But we need to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "154" and "T". The OCR output only has "154". 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "T" is missing, but "154" is present. The category is determined by whether all unique words from the ground truth are present. Since only one of the two is present, that would be partially correct. 

But wait, the categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. So here, since "154" is present but "T" is missing, it's category 2. 

I should also check if there are any typos or other factors. The OCR output is exactly "154", which matches the "154" in the ground truth. The "T" is missing. So the answer should be category 2.
