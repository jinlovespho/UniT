gt_text: EXIT
vlm_output: 1

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EXIT" and the VLM OCR output is "1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "1", which is a number. The ground truth is the word "EXIT".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output is "1" which is a numeral, not a word. The ground truth has the word "EXIT".

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has "EXIT" as the only unique word. The OCR output is "1", which is not a word, so it doesn't match "EXIT" even with typos or case. Since there's no match, it's not Category 1.

Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But since there are no matches here, it's not Category 2 either.

Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is "1", which is unrelated to "EXIT". So this falls under Category 3.
