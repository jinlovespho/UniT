gt_text: PAVIL JONKI
vlm_output: PAVILJONKI

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PAVIL JONKI" and the VLM OCR output is "PAVILJONKI". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "PAVILJONKI". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "PAVIL" and "JONKI". Wait, but the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI"—so maybe it's a single word. But the ground truth has two words. However, the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth has two unique words: "PAVIL" and "JONKI".

Now, looking at the OCR output. The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI". If I split this into possible words, maybe "PAVIL" and "JONKI" are present. Let's check: "PAVILJONKI" could be a typo where "PAVIL" is followed by "JONKI" but merged into one word. The instruction says small typos still count as matches. So even though it's one word instead of two, if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, even if merged, it might still be considered correct.

But wait, the OCR output is a single word. The ground truth has two words. But the comparison is based on the set of unique words. So if the OCR output includes "PAVIL" and "JONKI" as parts of the same word, does that count? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, even if they are merged, it's a match. However, in this case, the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", which is a single word. But the ground truth has two words. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered as having "PAVIL" and "JONKI" as parts of the same word, but since the OCR output is a single word, does that mean it's missing the space? But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered as containing both "PAVIL" and "JONKI" even though they are merged. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is a single word "PAVILJONKI", which is a typo of "PAVIL JONKI". The instruction says small typos still count as matches. So if "PAVILJONKI" is a typo where "PAVIL" is correct and "JONKI" is present as "JONKI" (but merged with "PAVIL"), but since the OCR output has both "PAVIL" and "JONKI" as parts of the same word, does that count? Wait, but the OCR output is a single word. The ground truth has two words. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, regardless of spacing, then it's correct. But if the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", does it contain "PAVIL" and "JONKI"? Well, "PAVIL" is the start of the OCR output, and "JONKI" is the end. So maybe the OCR output includes both words as parts of the same string, but since the instruction says to ignore spacing, maybe that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered as having "PAVILJONKI" as a single word, which is not present in the ground truth. However, the ground truth has "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output has "PAVIL" (as the first part) and "JONKI" (as the latter part). So if we split the OCR output into possible words, but the instruction says to ignore spacing, so maybe the OCR output is considered as containing both "PAVIL" and "JONKI" even if they are merged. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. So category 1: Correct.

But wait, the problem says "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". The ground truth has two unique words: "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", which is a single word. But does "PAVILJONKI" contain both "PAVIL" and "JONKI"? Yes, because "PAVIL" is the first part and "JONKI" is the latter part. However, since the OCR output is a single word, but the instruction says to ignore spacing. So even if the OCR output is a single word, as long as all the unique words from the ground truth are present (as substrings?), then it's correct. But the instructions don't specify whether substrings count. Wait, the instructions say "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the OCR output must contain each of those unique words. But if the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", does that contain "PAVIL" and "JONKI" as separate words? If the OCR output is a single word, then it's not containing the words as separate entities. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered as having the same words but with missing spaces. So "PAVILJONKI" would be considered as "PAVIL" and "JONKI" with a missing space. Since the instruction says to ignore missing spaces, then it's acceptable. Therefore, the OCR output contains both "PAVIL" and "JONKI", even though they are merged into one word. Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present. So category 1: Correct.
