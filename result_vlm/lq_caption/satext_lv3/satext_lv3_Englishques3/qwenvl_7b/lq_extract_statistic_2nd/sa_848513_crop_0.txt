gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CODE". The VLM OCR output says, "The visible English words and letters in the image are: "THE"".

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" as the visible words. So the extracted text is "THE".

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth "CODE". The unique words in the ground truth are just "CODE". The OCR output has "THE".

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from ground truth are present. The ground truth has "CODE" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "THE". So there's no match here. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but "THE" is not even close to "CODE". So no match. The category would be 3, since no words match. The output is not empty, but it's unrelated. So category 3.
