gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: SHAKERS

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHAKERS". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "SHAKERS", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue here. 

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHAKERS". The OCR output also has "SHAKERS". So the unique words match exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces, so they are the same here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, the answer should be 1.
