gt_text: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE
vlm_output: NORWEGIAN ESCAPE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE" and the VLM OCR output is the same. So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NORWEGIAN ESCAPE".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in reverse, it would still be correct. But here, they are the same. Also, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "NORWEGIAN" and "ESCAPE". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spacing—there's no punctuation, and spacing is the same. The note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the words match exactly. Even if there were minor typos, like "NORWEGIAN" being "NORWEGIAN" (which it is), it's still a match. So the answer should be 1.
