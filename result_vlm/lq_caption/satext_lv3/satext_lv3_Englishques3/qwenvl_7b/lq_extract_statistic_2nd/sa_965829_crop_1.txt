gt_text: Only taxi
vlm_output: Only

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Only taxi", and the VLM OCR output is "Only". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is just "Only".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. So the ground truth has two words: "Only" and "taxi". The OCR output has "Only".

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "Only", which matches the first word. But "taxi" is missing. Since the ground truth has two unique words and the OCR output only has one, that means not all are present. But the categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated.

So here, the OCR output has one of the two words. So that's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2. Even though the OCR missed "taxi", it did capture "Only", so it's at least one match but not all. So answer is 2.
