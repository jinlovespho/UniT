gt_text: KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON
vlm_output: KOMMUNISMON VANGLA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON". The OCR output is "KOMMUNISMON VANGLA".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "KOMMUNISMON VANGLA".

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into unique words: "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", "ON".

Now, the OCR output has "KOMMUNISMON" and "VANGLA". Let's check each word.

For "KOMMUNISM" in ground truth, the OCR has "KOMMUNISMON". The difference is the extra 'N' at the end. The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. So "KOMMUNISMON" is a typo of "KOMMUNISM". So that's a match.

Then "VANGLA" is present in both, so that's a match.

The ground truth has "ON", but the OCR output doesn't have that word. The OCR output has "KOMMUNISMON" instead of "KOMMUNISM" and "ON" is missing.

Wait, but the unique words in ground truth are "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", "ON". The OCR output has "KOMMUNISMON" (which is considered a match for "KOMMUNISM") and "VANGLA". So two out of three words match. But the third word "ON" is missing.

But the category is based on whether all unique ground truth words are present. The OCR output is missing "ON", so not all three. However, the instructions say category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear. Since "ON" is missing, it's not category 1. But category 2 is at least one but not all. Wait, the ground truth has three words: "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", "ON". The OCR has "KOMMUNISMON" (match for KOMMUNISM) and "VANGLA" (match). So two words match. But the third, "ON", is missing. So that's two out of three. But according to the categories, category 1 is all unique words, so this would be category 2 (partially correct). But wait, the OCR output has two words that match (KOMMUNISM and VANGLA) but the ground truth has three. However, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has two of the three words. Therefore, it's partially correct, so category 2. But wait, the OCR output has "KOMMUNISMON" which is a typo of "KOMMUNISM", so that's considered a match. So two words match (KOMMUNISM and VANGLA) but "ON" is missing. Therefore, it's not all three, so category 2. But the user might think that "ON" is missing, but the OCR output has two words. However, the ground truth has three. So category 2 is at least one but not all. Since two are matched, that's not all, so category 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
