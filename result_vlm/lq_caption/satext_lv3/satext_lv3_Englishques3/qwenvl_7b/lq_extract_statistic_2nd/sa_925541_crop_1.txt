Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "60". The VLM OCR output says there's a street scene with houses and trees, no English words or letters visible.

Step 1: Extract text from OCR output. The OCR output mentions "street scene", "houses", "trees", "no clear English words or letters". But the ground truth is "60", which is a number. 

Step 2: Compare. The ground truth has the word "60". The OCR output doesn't mention any numbers. The OCR says there are no English words or letters, so maybe numbers are considered letters here? But "60" is a number, not a word. The OCR output is talking about the image content, not text. So the OCR didn't extract any text, including numbers. Therefore, the extracted text from OCR is "no clear English words or letters", which doesn't include "60". 

The unique words in ground truth are just "60". The OCR output doesn't have that. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. But wait, the ground truth is a number. The OCR output says there are no English words or letters. Does "60" count as a number, and is it considered a word? The instructions say to compare based on unique words in ground truth. If "60" is considered a word, but the OCR output didn't detect it, then there's no match. So category 3 would be the answer.
