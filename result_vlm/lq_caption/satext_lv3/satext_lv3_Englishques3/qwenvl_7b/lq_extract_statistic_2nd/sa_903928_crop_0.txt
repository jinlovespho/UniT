gt_text: STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER
vlm_output: HOLCER

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER" and the OCR output is "HOLCER". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "HOLCER". 

Step 2 involves comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "STOLARZ", "BENJAMIN", and "HOLCER". 

Now, I need to check if the OCR output contains any of these words. The OCR output is "HOLCER", which is exactly one of the words in the ground truth. The other words, "STOLARZ" and "BENJAMIN", are not present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or it's unrelated. Since only "HOLCER" is present, that's at least one but not all. So the category should be 2. 

Wait, but the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The OCR output has only one word, which is a match. The other two words are missing. Therefore, it's partially correct. So the answer is 2.
