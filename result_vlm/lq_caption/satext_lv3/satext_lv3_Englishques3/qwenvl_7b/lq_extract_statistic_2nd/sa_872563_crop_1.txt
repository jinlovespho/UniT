gt_text: OX
vlm_output: OX

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OX" and the VLM OCR output is also "OX". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "OX". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the order was different, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "OX" as a single word. The OCR output also has "OX". Since they are the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There are no typos mentioned here, so that's not an issue. 

Since all the unique words match, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
