gt_text: NORD SUNDA
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "MORO".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NORD SUNDA" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is 'MORO'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the visible text is "MORO". So the extracted text here is "MORO".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "NORD" and "SUNDA". The OCR output has "MORO". 

Now, the comparison rules say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, the OCR output has a single word "MORO" versus the ground truth's two words. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "NORD" and "SUNDA". The OCR output has "MORO". Are any of these words matching? Let's check for typos. "MORO" vs "NORD" – not similar. "MORO" vs "SUNDA" – also not similar. So there's no match. 

Since the category is based on whether any of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since none match, even considering typos, it would be category 3. Wait, but the problem says "small typos still count as matches". But "MORO" isn't a typo of either "NORD" or "SUNDA". So no matches. Therefore, the answer is category 3.
