Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "POSTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "POSTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "POSTAGE", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "POSTAGE".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "POSTAGE". Now, the comparison has some specific conditions. Let me check each one:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, both are single words, so order is the same.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POSTAGE".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

So the OCR output has the same unique word as the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, which says all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this should be category 1. There's no missing words, and the one word matches exactly. So the answer is 1.
