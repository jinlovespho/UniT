gt_text: UNO
vlm_output: UNO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNO" and the VLM OCR output is also "UNO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "UNO", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "UNO".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are exactly "UNO".

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UNO". The OCR output also has "UNO". So they match exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. No typos either since they are identical.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, which they do here. So the answer should be category 1.
