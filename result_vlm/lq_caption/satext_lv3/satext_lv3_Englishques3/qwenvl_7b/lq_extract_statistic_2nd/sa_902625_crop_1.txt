gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are just "NIKE", the order is the same, but even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter here.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". So they match here.

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and no spaces. So no issues here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR has that same word, it's a match. So this should be category 1.

I don't see any other factors that would make this a partial or incorrect match. The output is exactly correct, so the answer should be 1.
