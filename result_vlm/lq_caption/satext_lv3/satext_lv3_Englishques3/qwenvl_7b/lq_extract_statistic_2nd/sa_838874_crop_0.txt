Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PKL" and the VLM OCR output is also "PKL". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "PKL".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are just three letters, there's no issue with order. Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, "PKL", and the OCR output also has "PKL". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase and no spaces or punctuation, so that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since "PKL" is present in both, and there's only one unique word, this should be category 1. There's no missing words or partial matches. The output is exactly correct. Therefore, the answer is 1.
