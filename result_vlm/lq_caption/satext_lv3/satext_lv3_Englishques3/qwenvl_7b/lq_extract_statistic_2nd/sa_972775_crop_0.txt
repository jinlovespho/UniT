gt_text: PLM 9H
vlm_output: 9H-PLM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLM 9H". The OCR output from the VLM is "9H-PLM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "9H-PLM". So the extracted text is just that string.

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two words: "PLM" and "9H". The OCR output has "9H" and "PLM", but they're separated by a hyphen. 

But the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "PLM" and "9H". The OCR output has "9H" and "PLM" as well. However, the hyphen might be considered as punctuation. The instructions say to ignore punctuation. So the hyphen is ignored, and the OCR output effectively has "9H" and "PLM".

Also, the instructions mention ignoring extra/missing spaces. The ground truth has a space between "PLM" and "9H", but the OCR output uses a hyphen. But since we're ignoring punctuation, the hyphen is treated as a separator, but maybe the words are still considered as separate. 

Wait, but the ground truth's words are "PLM" and "9H". The OCR output's words are "9H" and "PLM" (split by hyphen). So the set of words in the OCR output would be {"9H", "PLM"}, which matches exactly the ground truth's {"PLM", "9H"}.

So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The order doesn't matter. Also, capitalization is ignored, but in this case, both are uppercase. So this should be category 1: Correct.
