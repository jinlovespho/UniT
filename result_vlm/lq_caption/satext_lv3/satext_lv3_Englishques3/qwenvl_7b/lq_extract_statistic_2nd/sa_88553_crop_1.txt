gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: Nikon

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Nikon".

Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, there's only one word, so order isn't an issue.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both texts are exactly "Nikon", so no issues here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're identical.

Looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "Nikon" which matches the ground truth's "Nikon", this meets the criteria.

So the answer should be category 1.
