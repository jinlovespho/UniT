Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Schweppes" and the VLM OCR output is also "Schweppes". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "Schweppes".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Schweppes". The OCR output also has "Schweppes". Since they are exactly the same, even if there were minor typos, it would still count as a match. But in this case, there's no typo. So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no case where part of the words match here. The OCR output isn't missing any words or having extra ones. So the answer should be 1.
