gt_text: FLUVIAL CLUB
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""THE"

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FLUVIAL CLUB". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""THE""

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" twice. So the extracted text is "THE THE" or just "THE" repeated. But maybe the actual words are just "THE" since it's mentioned twice. Wait, the OCR output says "THE" in quotes, maybe indicating that's the text detected. But the exact text is "THE" repeated. So the OCR output's text is "THE THE".

Now, the ground truth is "FLUVIAL CLUB". The unique words here are "FLUVIAL" and "CLUB". The OCR output has "THE" as the only word. Comparing the unique words: "FLUVIAL" and "CLUB" are not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "THE", which isn't in the ground truth. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output has "THE" but that's not part of the ground truth words. Even if there were typos or case differences, but in this case, the words themselves are different. So the answer should be category 3.
