gt_text: M

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "M" and the VLM OCR output is also "M". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "M", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. They mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "M". The OCR output also has "M". 

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, both are just "M", so no issues there. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here because they're the same.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has "M" and the OCR output has "M", that's a match. So it should be category 1. 

I don't see any other factors here. The output isn't empty, and there's a full match. So the answer is 1.
