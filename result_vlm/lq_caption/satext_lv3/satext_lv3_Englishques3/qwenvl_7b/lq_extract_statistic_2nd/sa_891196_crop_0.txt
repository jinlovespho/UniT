gt_text: ARR
vlm_output: ARR

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARR" and the VLM OCR output is also "ARR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "ARR", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are exactly "ARR".

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ARR". The OCR output also has "ARR". So the unique words match.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are uppercase and no spaces, that's not an issue here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because both are the same.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has the same word as the ground truth, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the category should be 1.
