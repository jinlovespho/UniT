gt_text: Card only
vlm_output: Card only

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Card only" and the VLM OCR output is also "Card only". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Card only".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, like "only Card", it would still be considered correct. But in this case, the order is the same.

Next, the comparison is based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Card" and "only". The OCR output has the same two words. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Then, we have to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here either.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this should be category 1 — Correct.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches perfectly with the ground truth based on all the given criteria. So the answer must be 1.
