gt_text: 123 23
vlm_output: The image contains the following text: "S"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "123 23". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the following text: "S"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "The image contains the following text: "S"" So the actual text here is "S" enclosed in quotes. But maybe the OCR is trying to say that the image has the text "S"? Wait, but the ground truth is numbers: 123 and 23. The OCR output is saying the image has "S", which is a letter. 

Now, step 2: compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are "123" and "23". The OCR output's extracted text is "S". 

The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But the OCR output has "S", which is not "123" or "23". So none of the ground truth words are present. 

Also, the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are in OCR output. Here, none are present. Category 2 is if at least one but not all. But in this case, zero. So category 3 is if no words match or output is unrelated. The OCR output is "S", which is unrelated to the ground truth numbers. So category 3.
