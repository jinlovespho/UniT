gt_text: HORVE 13

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HORVE 13" and the VLM OCR output is "13". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is just "13", so that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches. 

The ground truth has two parts: "HORVE" and "13". The OCR output only has "13". Let's break this down. The unique words in the ground truth are "HORVE" and "13". The OCR output has "13" but not "HORVE". 

Now, according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Here, "HORVE" is missing, so it's not Category 1. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all unique words match. The OCR output has "13", which is one of the two unique words in the ground truth. So that would make it Category 2. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is largely wrong. Since "13" is present, it's not Category 3. 

Wait, but I should check if there's any possibility of "HORVE" being present in the OCR output in a different form. The OCR output is "13", which doesn't include "HORVE" at all. So no match there. 

So, the OCR output has one of the two unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, it's partially correct, which is Category 2.
