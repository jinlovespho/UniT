gt_text: MAXI ZOO
vlm_output: MAXI ZOO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAXI ZOO" and the VLM OCR output is also "MAXI ZOO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the extracted text is "MAXI ZOO".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two words: "MAXI" and "ZOO". The OCR output is the same, so both words are present. Since the order doesn't matter, even if they were reversed, it would still be correct. Also, capitalization is ignored, but in this case, both are uppercase, so no issue. There are no typos here either. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means it falls under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. The output is exactly matching the ground truth in terms of words, even if other factors like spacing were different, but here they are the same. So the answer should be 1.
