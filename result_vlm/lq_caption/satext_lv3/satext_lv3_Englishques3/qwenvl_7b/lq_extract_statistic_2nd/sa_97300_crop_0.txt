gt_text: in
vlm_output: in

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "in", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are just "in", so order isn't an issue here.

Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". So they match exactly in terms of unique words. 

Then, ignore capitalization. But both are lowercase, so that's not a factor here. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored. Since there's no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue. Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, according to the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
