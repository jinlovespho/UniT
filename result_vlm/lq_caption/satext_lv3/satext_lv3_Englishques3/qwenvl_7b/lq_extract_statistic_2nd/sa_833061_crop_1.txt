gt_text: TOD'S
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"KFC"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOD'S" and the VLM OCR output says "The visible English word in the image is: KFC". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KFC" as the visible word. So the extracted text is "KFC".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "TOD'S". The unique words in the ground truth are just "TOD'S" since it's a single word. The OCR output has "KFC" which is a different word. 

Considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word each. The comparison is based on unique words. The OCR output's word is "KFC" versus the ground truth "TOD'S". They are different. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. No typos in the OCR output, but "KFC" isn't a typo of "TOD'S". So no matches. 

Therefore, the category should be 3 because there are no matches. The OCR output didn't capture the correct word. Even though the output is not empty, it's unrelated. So the answer is 3.
