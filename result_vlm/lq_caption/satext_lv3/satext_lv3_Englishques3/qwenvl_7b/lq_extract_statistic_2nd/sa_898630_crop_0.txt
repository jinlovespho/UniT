gt_text: IKEA
vlm_output: IKEA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "IKEA" and the VLM OCR output is also "IKEA". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "IKEA", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But here, both are exactly "IKEA".

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "IKEA". The OCR output also has "IKEA". 

They mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are all caps and no spaces. So no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "IKEA") are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches exactly. Even if there were typos, like "IK3A" or something, it would still count, but here it's perfect. So the answer is 1.
