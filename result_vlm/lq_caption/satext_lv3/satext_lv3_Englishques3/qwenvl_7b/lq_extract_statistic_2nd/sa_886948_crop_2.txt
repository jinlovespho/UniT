gt_text: FM AM
vlm_output: AMFM

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FM AM" and the VLM OCR output is "AMFM". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "AMFM". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering the specified factors.

The ground truth has two words: "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM", which is a single string without spaces. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I should check if both "FM" and "AM" are present in the OCR output, regardless of order.

But wait, the OCR output is "AMFM". Let's break it down. If we split "AMFM" into possible words, maybe "AM" and "FM" are there. However, since there's no space, the OCR might have combined them into one word. But the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "FM" and "AM".

The comparison should be based on whether the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. So, even if the OCR output is "AMFM" without spaces, if it includes both "AM" and "FM" as substrings, does that count?

But the instruction says "unique words in the ground truth". The ground truth words are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AMFM". If we split "AMFM" into possible words, maybe "AM" and "FM" are present. However, the OCR output is a single string. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words, so perhaps the OCR output needs to have both "AM" and "FM" as separate words, but since there's no space, maybe it's considered as one word. However, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe "AMFM" is treated as "AM FM" when considering spaces.

Wait, the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So even if the OCR output is "AMFM" (without spaces), it might be considered as "AM FM" when spaces are ignored. So in that case, the words would be "AM" and "FM", which matches the ground truth words exactly. Also, the capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase here, so that's fine. There are no typos mentioned here. So the OCR output contains both "AM" and "FM", just in a different order and without a space, but since order doesn't matter and spaces are ignored, this would be a correct match. Therefore, category 1.
