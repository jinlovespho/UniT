Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ALSTOM" and the VLM OCR output is also "ALSTOM". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "ALSTOM".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "ALSTOM". The OCR output is the same word. So when comparing, even if there were typos, they would still count as a match. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's category 1. There's no case difference, no missing words, so it's definitely correct. No chance of being category 2 or 3 here.
