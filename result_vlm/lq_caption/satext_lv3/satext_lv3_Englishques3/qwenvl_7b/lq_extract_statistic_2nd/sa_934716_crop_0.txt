gt_text: TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"RAT"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM" and an OCR output from a VLM which says "The visible English word in the image is: RAT". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible English word in the image is: RAT". So the extracted text is "RAT". 

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "TUUM", "SUB", "PRÆSIDI", and "UM". But the OCR output only has "RAT". Now, the comparison criteria mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. However, the OCR output has "RAT" which is a single word, and the ground truth has four words. 

The key points here are: the OCR output must have all unique ground truth words (ignoring order, case, etc.) for category 1. If it has at least one but not all, it's category 2. If none match or it's unrelated, it's category 3.

Looking at the OCR output's "RAT" versus the ground truth words. None of the ground truth words are "RAT". The ground truth words are Latin, and "RAT" is an English word. Even if we ignore case, "rat" is not present in the ground truth. The ground truth words are TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, UM. So there's no overlap in the words. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

But wait, the OCR output is "RAT", which is a single word. The ground truth has four words. Since there's no match between "RAT" and any of the ground truth words, even considering typos (though "RAT" isn't a typo of any of the ground truth words), the category would be 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
