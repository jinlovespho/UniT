gt_text: 29
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "29" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So the actual text here is "1" inside the code block. The rest is just descriptive text, but the OCR output is supposed to capture the visible text. So the extracted text from the OCR is "1".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "29". The unique words in the ground truth are just "29" since it's a single number. The OCR output has "1" as the extracted text. 

Looking at the criteria: the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "29" and the OCR has "1". These are different numbers. The problem says that small typos still count as matches, but here it's not a typo, it's a completely different number. So there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output's extracted text is "1" and the ground truth is "29", there's no overlap. Therefore, the category should be 3.
