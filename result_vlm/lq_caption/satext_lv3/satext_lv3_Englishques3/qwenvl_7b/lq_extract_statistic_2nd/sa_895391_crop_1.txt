gt_text: Cervantes
vlm_output: curriculum

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Cervantes" and the VLM OCR output is "curriculum". The task is to compare these two based on the given steps and categories.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here as "curriculum". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "Cervantes". The OCR output has "curriculum".

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here since both are single words. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "Cervantes". The OCR output has "curriculum".

Next, ignoring capitalization. "Cervantes" is capitalized, but the OCR output is lowercase. But even if we consider that, they are different words. Also, the problem says to ignore capitalization, but the words themselves need to match. "Cervantes" vs "curriculum" – even if we ignore case, they are not the same word. There's no typo here because "curriculum" is a different word entirely. The OCR output is not a typo of "Cervantes"; it's a completely different word. 

So, the unique word in the ground truth is "Cervantes", and the OCR output has "curriculum". Since there's no match, according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
