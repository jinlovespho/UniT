Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "D'ARTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "D'ARTE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "D'ARTE".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "D'ARTE". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, both texts are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no extra or missing spaces here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case; the OCR output is identical to the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here, so categories 2 or 3 don't apply. The answer should be 1.
