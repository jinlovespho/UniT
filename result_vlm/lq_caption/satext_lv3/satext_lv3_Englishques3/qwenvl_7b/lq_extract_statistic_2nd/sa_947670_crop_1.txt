gt_text: RYANAIR
vlm_output: The image appears to be very blurry, making it difficult to extract any clear text or letters. If there is any text present in the image, it is not discernible due to the blurriness.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to determine the category based on the OCR output compared to the ground truth. The ground truth is "RYANAIR". The OCR output says the image is blurry and can't extract any clear text.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that there's no clear text due to blurriness. So the extracted text here is basically that there's no discernible text.

Now step 2: compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "RYANAIR", which is a single word. The OCR output doesn't mention any words. The instructions say to consider unique words in the ground truth. Since the OCR output has no words, there's nothing to match. 

The categories are 1, 2, or 3. Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. But here, the OCR output has none. Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But again, the OCR output has no words. So it's category 3: incorrect, because no words match. The output is empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
