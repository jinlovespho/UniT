gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: MUSEUM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is also "MUSEUM". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "MUSEUM", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MUSEUM". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring case, spacing, etc. Both are uppercase, same spelling. There are no typos here. So all unique ground truth words (only one) are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct when all unique words match, this should be category 1.
