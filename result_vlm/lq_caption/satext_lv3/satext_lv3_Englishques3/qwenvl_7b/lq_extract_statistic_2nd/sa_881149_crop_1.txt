gt_text: FASHION
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FASHION" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```". The part inside the backticks is "1234567890", which are numbers. So the extracted text would be the numbers 1234567890.

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "FASHION", which is a single word. The OCR output's extracted text is numbers, not letters. 

The comparison rules say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output has numbers, and the ground truth has the word "FASHION". Since there's no overlap in the words (the OCR output has digits, not letters), there are no matches. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any letters at all. So even if we consider typos, there's nothing to match. 

Therefore, the category would be 3, since no words match and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
