gt_text: 山公園 08
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"平顶山公园"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, let's look at the ground truth text: "山公園 08". Then, the OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"平顶山公园"". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output starts with some English text, but the key part here is "平顶山公园". The rest is just a description of what the OCR is doing. So the extracted text from OCR is "平顶山公园".

Now, the ground truth is "山公園 08". Let's break down the words. The ground truth has two parts: "山公園" and "08". However, the OCR output is "平顶山公园", which is a different phrase. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "山公園" and "08". The OCR output has "平顶山公园". 

But wait, "平顶山公园" is a different term. Let me check if there's any overlap. "山公園" is part of "平顶山公园". However, the OCR output is a different phrase. The ground truth has "山公園" (which is "mountain park" in Japanese, maybe?), and "08". The OCR output is "平顶山公园" which translates to "Pingdingshan Park" in Chinese. 

So the OCR output doesn't contain "山公園" or "08". The words in the OCR output are "平顶山公园", which is a different name. Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

But wait, the ground truth has "山公園" and "08". The OCR output has "平顶山公园" which is a different term. So there's no match for either of the ground truth words. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. 

However, maybe I should check if there's a typo or something. For example, "平顶山" might have "山" which is part of the ground truth's "山公園". But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's words are "山公園" and "08". The OCR output has "平顶山公园", which is a different word. Even though "山" is present in "平顶山公园", the entire word "山公園" isn't there. So that doesn't count. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category would be 3.
