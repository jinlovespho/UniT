gt_text: EC-LVP
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:```plaintextL```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EC-LVP", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:```plaintextL```". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "L" as the visible letter. So the extracted text here is just "L".

Next, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has "EC-LVP". Let's break down the unique words in the ground truth. Wait, "EC-LVP" might be considered as a single term or split into parts? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "EC-LVP" isn't a standard word. Maybe it's an acronym or a specific term. However, the OCR output only has "L". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spaces. But the ground truth is "EC-LVP" which includes hyphen and letters. The OCR output has just "L". So the unique words in ground truth would be "EC-LVP" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output has "L". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If "EC-LVP" is considered a single word, then the OCR output doesn't have that word. However, maybe the ground truth is split into "EC", "L", "VP"? But the original text is "EC-LVP", which is likely a single term, like an acronym. So the unique words in ground truth would be "EC-LVP" (one word). The OCR output has "L" as a letter. 

But according to the rules, small typos still count as matches. However, "L" is not a part of "EC-LVP" unless the OCR missed the other letters. Since the OCR only found "L", which is one of the letters in the ground truth, but the ground truth is a single term. 

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "EC-LVP", which is one unique word, then the OCR output has "L" which is not a word but a single letter. So there's no match. 

Alternatively, if the ground truth is considered as multiple parts, like "EC", "L", "VP", but that's not clear. The original text is "EC-LVP" which is probably a single term. Therefore, the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. But wait, the OCR output has "L" which is a letter in the ground truth. However, the problem states to compare based on unique words, not letters. So if the ground truth is considered as a single word "EC-LVP", then the OCR output has nothing matching. Therefore, category 3. 

Alternatively, if "EC-LVP" is split into "EC", "L", "VP" as separate words, then "L" would be a match. But the original text is "EC-LVP" with a hyphen, which is more likely a single term. So the answer would be category 3. But I need to check the instructions again. 

The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "EC-LVP", that's one unique word. The OCR output has "L" which is not a word. Therefore, no match. Hence category 3. But maybe the hyphen is considered a separator? Like "EC", "L", "VP"? But that's an assumption. The problem says "unique words in the ground truth", so if the ground truth is "EC-LVP", it's one word. So the answer is category 3.
