gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: Duty

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Duty" and the VLM OCR output is also "Duty". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Duty".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Duty". The OCR output also has "Duty". So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in terms of case and spacing. No punctuation here either.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly correct.

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no possibility of it being partially correct or incorrect here. The answer should be 1.
