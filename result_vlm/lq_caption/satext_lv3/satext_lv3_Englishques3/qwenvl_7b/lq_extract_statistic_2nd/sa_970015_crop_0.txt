gt_text: APL COSCO
vlm_output: APL

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "APL COSCO" and the VLM OCR output is "APL". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "APL", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "APL" and "COSCO". The OCR output has only "APL".

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But here, the OCR output only has one of the two words. So that's not category 1.

Category 2 is slightly correct if at least one but not all unique words match. The OCR output has "APL" which is one of the two words in the ground truth. So that's at least one match, but not all. So that would be category 2.

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo, just missing a word. Also, the OCR output is missing "COSCO". So since only one word is present, it's partially correct. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
