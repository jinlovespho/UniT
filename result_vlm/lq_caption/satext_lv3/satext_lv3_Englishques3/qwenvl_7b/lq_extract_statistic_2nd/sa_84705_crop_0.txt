gt_text: ROADHOUSE Logan's
vlm_output: AQUA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROADHOUSE Logan's" and the VLM OCR output is "AQUA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "AQUA". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "ROADHOUSE" and "Logan's". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. But I need to look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "ROADHOUSE" and "Logan's". 

Now, the OCR output is "AQUA", which is a single word. Let's check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. "AQUA" doesn't match "ROADHOUSE" or "Logan's" even when ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has no words that are present in the ground truth. 

Also, the categories say that category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "AQUA" is completely different and there's no overlap in words, this should be category 3.
