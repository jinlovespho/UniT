gt_text: NE BHARATMALA ROAD TO 3 PROSPERITY
vlm_output: NE 3BRASILIA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. The task is to compare them based on specific criteria and categorize the result into one of three categories: 1 (correct), 2 (partially correct), or 3 (incorrect).

So, the ground truth is "NE BHARATMALA ROAD TO 3 PROSPERITY". The OCR output is "NE 3BRASILIA". Let's break down the steps as outlined.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NE 3BRASILIA". That's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The categories are based on how many unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Let me list the unique words from the ground truth first. The ground truth text is "NE BHARATMALA ROAD TO 3 PROSPERITY". Breaking that down, the unique words are: NE, BHARATMALA, ROAD, TO, 3, PROSPERITY. So six unique words.

Now, looking at the OCR output: "NE 3BRASILIA". Let's split that into words. It's "NE" and "3BRASILIA". But wait, the OCR might have merged some parts. Let me check if there's a space between 3 and BRASILIA. The OCR output is written as "3BRASILIA", which is one word. However, the original ground truth has "3" as a separate word. So, in the OCR output, "3BRASILIA" could be a typo or misinterpretation of "3 PROSPERITY" or "3 ROAD" or something else. But according to the rules, small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR output's "3BRASILIA" is combining the number 3 with the word BRASILIA, which isn't present in the ground truth.

So, let's see which words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "NE" which matches exactly with the ground truth's "NE". That's one match. Then, the OCR has "3BRASILIA". Let's check if any part of this corresponds to the ground truth words. The number 3 is present in the ground truth as a separate word, but here it's merged with BRASILIA. However, the rules say that small typos count as matches. But "3BRASILIA" isn't a typo of "3" but rather a different word. The original ground truth has "3" as a standalone word, but the OCR output has "3" as part of another word. However, since the OCR output has "3" in it, maybe that counts? Wait, but the rule says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So each unique word in the ground truth needs to be present in the OCR output. Let's check each one:

Ground truth unique words:
1. NE
2. BHARATMALA
3. ROAD
4. TO
5. 3
6. PROSPERITY

OCR output words:
- NE
- 3BRASILIA

So, "NE" matches. The rest of the words from the ground truth (Bharatmala, Road, To, 3, Prosperity) are not present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output has "3" as part of "3BRASILIA". But according to the rules, we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present. The OCR output's "3BRASILIA" doesn't contain "3" as a separate word. It's part of a combined word. The rules say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but "3" is a separate word in the ground truth. The OCR output has "3" as part of another word, which might not count as a separate word. So, the word "3" from the ground truth isn't present in the OCR output as a standalone word. Similarly, "BRASILIA" isn't in the ground truth. So, only "NE" matches.

Therefore, out of the six unique words in the ground truth, only one ("NE") is present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, that's category 2 (partially correct). However, I need to check if "3BRASILIA" could be considered as containing "3" as part of the word. But the rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So "3" is a unique word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has "3" as part of another word. However, the rules don't specify whether partial matches count. The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, for the OCR output to have a match, it must contain the exact word (or a typo of it) as present in the ground truth. Since "3" is a standalone word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has it merged with "BRASILIA", that's not a match. Therefore, only "NE" is a match. So, one out of six unique words. That's at least one but not all, so category 2.

But wait, the rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. For example, if the OCR had "3" instead of "3" (but that's the same), or maybe "3" is a typo. But in this case, the OCR output has "3" as part of another word. However, the ground truth has "3" as a separate word. So, does the OCR output count as containing "3"? If the OCR output has "3BRASILIA", does that include "3" as a substring? The rules don't specify whether substring matches count, only that small typos count as matches. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. So, the OCR output must have the exact word (or a typo) from the ground truth. Since "3BRASILIA" isn't a typo of "3", but rather combines "3" with another word, it's not considered a match. Therefore, only "NE" is a match.

Thus, the answer would be category 2 (partially correct) because at least one word matches but not all.
