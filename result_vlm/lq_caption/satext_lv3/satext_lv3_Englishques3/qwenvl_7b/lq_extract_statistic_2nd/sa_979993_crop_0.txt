gt_text: VERSACE
vlm_output: VERSACE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VERSACE" and the VLM OCR output is also "VERSACE". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "VERSACE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word in both, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "VERSACE". The OCR output also has "VERSACE". 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and single word. The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, but since both are uppercase, that's not a problem. There are no typos mentioned here, so the OCR output matches exactly.

So according to the categories: if all unique ground truth words are present (which they are), it's category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
