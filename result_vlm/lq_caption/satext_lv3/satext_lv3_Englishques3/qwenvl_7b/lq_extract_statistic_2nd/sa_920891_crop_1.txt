gt_text: ELEVEN
vlm_output: 7-ELEVEN

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ELEVEN" and the VLM OCR output is "7-ELEVEN". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "7-ELEVEN". So the text content would be "7-ELEVEN".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "ELEVEN". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

So the ground truth has the word "ELEVEN". The OCR output has "7-ELEVEN". Let's break this down. The OCR output includes "7" and "ELEVEN" (since hyphens are ignored). But the ground truth only has "ELEVEN". 

Wait, but the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are just "ELEVEN". The OCR output has "7" and "ELEVEN". However, "7" isn't part of the ground truth. But the problem says to consider only the unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth. 

In this case, the ground truth has "ELEVEN", and the OCR output has "ELEVEN" as part of "7-ELEVEN". Even though there's a "7" in the OCR output, that's not part of the ground truth. But since the OCR output includes "ELEVEN", which is the only unique word in the ground truth, then all unique ground truth words are present. 

Wait, but the OCR output has "7-ELEVEN". So the words here would be "7" and "ELEVEN" if we split by hyphen. But the ground truth is just "ELEVEN". So the OCR output includes "ELEVEN" as a word, even though there's a "7" before it. 

But according to the instructions, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "ELEVEN" as the only word. The OCR output includes "ELEVEN" as part of its text. So even though there's a "7", the presence of "ELEVEN" in the OCR output would mean that all unique ground truth words are present. 

So that would fall under category 1: Correct. Because all unique ground truth words (just "ELEVEN") are present in the OCR output. The "7" is extra, but the instructions say to ignore extra spaces, punctuation, etc. So the hyphen and the "7" are considered as punctuation or extra characters, and the main word "ELEVEN" is there. 

Therefore, the answer is 1.
