gt_text: DELTA CONNECTION DELTA
vlm_output: Delta

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DELTA CONNECTION DELTA". The VLM OCR output is "Delta".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "Delta". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The ground truth has two unique words: "DELTA" and "CONNECTION". But the OCR output only has "Delta". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we just check if the words are present. Ignore capitalization, so "Delta" matches "DELTA". But the other word in the ground truth is "CONNECTION", which isn't in the OCR output. 

So the OCR output has one of the two unique words. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since "CONNECTION" is missing, it's partially correct. Therefore, the answer should be 2.
