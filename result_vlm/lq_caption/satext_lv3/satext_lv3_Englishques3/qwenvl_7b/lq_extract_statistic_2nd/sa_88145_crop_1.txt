gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: HSBC

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC" and the VLM OCR output is also "HSBC". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HSBC", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "HSBC". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because they are identical. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
