gt_text: Ingeborg STOCKHOLM
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Ingeborg STOCKHOLM". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE" — so the actual text here is "THE". But wait, the quotes might be part of the OCR output? The way it's written, it's "are:"THE"", which might mean that the OCR detected the word "THE" as the visible text. So the extracted text is "THE".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "Ingeborg" and "STOCKHOLM". The OCR output has "THE". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Ingeborg" and "STOCKHOLM". The OCR output has "THE", which is a different word. 

Even if we consider case insensitivity, "THE" doesn't match either "Ingeborg" or "STOCKHOLM". Also, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, 3 if none match. Since neither "Ingeborg" nor "STOCKHOLM" are in the OCR output, the category would be 3. 

Wait, but the OCR output is "THE". Are there any typos or possible matches? For example, could "THE" be a typo for "Ingeborg" or "STOCKHOLM"? But that seems unlikely. The problem says small typos still count as matches, but "THE" is entirely different from both words. So no match here. 

Therefore, the answer is category 3.
