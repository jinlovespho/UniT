gt_text: OFFICE POST
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OFFICE POST" and the VLM OCR output is "POST OFFICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "POST OFFICE". Then, I compare this with the ground truth, keeping in mind the specified criteria.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that shouldn't affect the comparison. Next, we're to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "OFFICE" and "POST". The OCR output also has the same two words, just in reverse order. 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, both texts have the same words. The OCR output has "POST" and "OFFICE", which are the same as the ground truth's words. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, all unique ground truth words ("OFFICE" and "POST") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
