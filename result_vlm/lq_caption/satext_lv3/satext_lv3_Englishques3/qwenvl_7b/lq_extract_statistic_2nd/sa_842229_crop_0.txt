Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "amazon" and the VLM OCR output is also "amazon". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "amazon", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "amazon".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are 1, 2, or 3.

The ground truth has the word "amazon". The OCR output is exactly the same. So the unique words in ground truth are just "amazon". The OCR output has "amazon" as well. So all unique words from ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like "amazn", it would still count as a match because small typos are allowed. But here, it's exact. So according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output, ignoring order, case, etc. So the answer should be 1.
