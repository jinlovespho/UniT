gt_text: GEOTAB
vlm_output: GEOTAB

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GEOTAB" and the VLM OCR output is also "GEOTAB". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But in this case, there's only one word in both. The ground truth has "GEOTAB" and the OCR output is the same. So the set of unique words in the ground truth is just {"GEOTAB"}, and the OCR output has the same. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same, so it's a full match.
