gt_text: SHACK
vlm_output: SHACK

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHACK" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHACK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "SHACK".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHACK". The OCR output also has "SHACK". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization. Both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. There are no typos here because both are exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
