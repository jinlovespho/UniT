gt_text: Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM
vlm_output: 2

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Platform Lumpur Kuala 2 SKTM" and the VLM OCR output is just "2". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2", which is a single number. Now, comparing this to the ground truth, which has multiple words: "Platform", "Lumpur", "Kuala", "2", and "SKTM". 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Next, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The unique words here are "Platform", "Lumpur", "Kuala", "2", and "SKTM". 

Now, the OCR output is "2". The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output here is just the number "2", which is present in the ground truth. But the other words like "Platform", "Lumpur", "Kuala", and "SKTM" are not present in the OCR output. 

The category definitions are:
- 1: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
- 2: At least one but not all unique words match.
- 3: No words match or output is unrelated/empty.

Since the OCR output only has "2" and the ground truth has five unique words, only one of them matches. Therefore, according to category 2, which requires at least one match but not all, this should be category 2. However, I need to check if the OCR output is considered to have any matches. The number "2" is present in both, so that's one match. The rest are not present. So, it's partially correct, hence category 2. 

But wait, the ground truth has "2" as one of the words. The OCR output has "2", which is a match. So even though the other words are missing, since at least one unique word is present, it's category 2. The answer should be 2.
