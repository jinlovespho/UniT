gt_text: Microsoft
vlm_output: Microsoft

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Microsoft" and the VLM OCR output is also "Microsoft". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Microsoft", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "Microsoft".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Microsoft". The OCR output also has "Microsoft". 

Now, checking the comparison criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are the same here. Also, small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth (which is just "Microsoft") are all present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it matches, the answer should be 1.
