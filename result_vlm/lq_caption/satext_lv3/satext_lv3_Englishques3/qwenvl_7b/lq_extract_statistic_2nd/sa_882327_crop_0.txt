gt_text: ARLINGTON STREET SW1 CITY WESTMINSTER OF
vlm_output: WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text and a VLM OCR output, and I need to categorize the OCR output as 1, 2, or 3 based on specific criteria.

First, the ground truth text is "ARLINGTON STREET SW1 CITY WESTMINSTER OF". The OCR output is "WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT". I need to process this text for comparison.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

First, let's break down the ground truth into unique words. The ground truth words are: ARLINGTON, STREET, SW1, CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF. So the unique words are these six. 

Now, the OCR output is "WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT". Let's split this into possible words. But since there are no spaces, I need to consider possible splits. However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces, so maybe the OCR output is considered as a single string without spaces, but we need to check for the presence of the words from the ground truth in any form.

Wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So I need to check if the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth, regardless of order, case, spacing, and small typos.

But the OCR output is "WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT". Let's look for each ground truth word in this string, ignoring case and possible typos.

First, let's list the ground truth words again (case-insensitive): arlington, street, sw1, city, westminster, of.

Now, check if each of these words is present in the OCR output:

1. "arlington" – The OCR has "WASHINGTON". "Washington" is similar to "Arlington"? Not really. They are different. So no match here.

2. "street" – The OCR has "STREET" in "WASHINGTONSTREETEXIT". So "street" is present here. That's a match.

3. "sw1" – The OCR output doesn't have "SW1" or any variation. So no match.

4. "city" – The OCR output has "EXIT" but not "CITY". No match.

5. "westminster" – The OCR has "WASHINGTON" which is similar but not "westminster". So no match.

6. "of" – The OCR output doesn't have "OF" or any variation. No match.

So, from the ground truth words, only "street" is present in the OCR output. That's one match out of six. According to the categories, if at least one but not all words match, it's category 2 (partially correct). 

But wait, the user said "small typos still count as matches." Let me check if any of the other words could be considered with typos. For example, "WASHINGTON" might be a typo for "ARLINGTON"? But "Washington" and "Arlington" are different place names. Even with typos, they are not similar enough to count as a match. Similarly, "SW1" is a postcode, and the OCR output has "WASHINGTON" which doesn't resemble "SW1". 

Therefore, only "street" is a match. Since only one out of six words match, the category is 2 (partially correct). So the answer should be 2.
