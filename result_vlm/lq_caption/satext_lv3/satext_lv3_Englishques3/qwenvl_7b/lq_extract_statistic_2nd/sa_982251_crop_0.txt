gt_text: FOUR FOUR
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```S```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FOUR FOUR", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is: ```S```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "visible text in the image is: ```S```". So the actual extracted text here is "S". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "FOUR" and "FOUR" again, but since we're considering unique words, it's just "FOUR". The OCR output has "S". 

Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to see if the unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth's unique word is "FOUR", and the OCR output has "S". There's no match here. 

Also, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. But "S" doesn't relate to "FOUR" in any way. Even if there were typos, like "FOWR", that's still not matching "S". 

So, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
