gt_text: Cannabis
vlm_output: Cannabis

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Cannabis" and the VLM OCR output is also "Cannabis". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Cannabis", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it wouldn't matter here. But in this case, they are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Cannabis". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation here either. 

Small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, the OCR output is perfect. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that means it's category 1 — Correct.
