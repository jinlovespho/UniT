gt_text: Dior CONGRATULATIONS
vlm_output: CONGRATULATIONS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "Dior CONGRATULATIONS". The VLM OCR output is "CONGRATULATIONS". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "CONGRATULATIONS".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, let's break down the ground truth. The unique words are "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output has only "CONGRATULATIONS".

Now, considering the rules: we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "CONGRATULATIONS", which matches the "CONGRATULATIONS" in the ground truth. However, the "Dior" part is missing from the OCR output. 

But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words, "Dior" and "CONGRATULATIONS". The OCR output only has one of them. 

However, the categories are:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all.
3 — Incorrect: none or largely wrong.

In this case, the OCR output is missing "Dior" but has "CONGRATULATIONS". So, only one of the two unique words is present. That would fall under category 2: Slightly correct (partially correct). 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if "Dior" is considered a word here. The ground truth has "Dior" as a brand name, which is a proper noun. The OCR output doesn't include that. So, the OCR missed one of the two unique words. Therefore, since not all are present, it's category 2.

But I need to make sure there's no typo. The OCR output is exactly "CONGRATULATIONS", which is the same as in the ground truth, except for the missing "Dior". Since the problem says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo, just a missing word. So, the absence of "Dior" is a problem. Therefore, the answer is category 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 87
2. Slightly Correct Num: 39
3. Incorrect Num: 224
