Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon" and the VLM OCR output is also "Nikon". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Nikon".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria given are that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one unique word: "Nikon". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor typos, it would still count as a match. But in this case, there are no typos. The capitalization is the same, and there's no punctuation or spacing issues. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "Nikon" which matches the ground truth's "Nikon", this meets category 1. There's no case where any words are missing or incorrect here. So the answer should be 1.
