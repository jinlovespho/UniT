gt_text: Richards St.
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "W 42 St"- "10th Ave"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Richards St." and the VLM OCR output has "W 42 St" and "10th Ave". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output lists two phrases: "W 42 St" and "10th Ave". So the extracted text would be those two strings.

Next, comparing them to the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "Richards" and "St." (Street abbreviation). Now, looking at the OCR output, the words present are "W", "42", "St", "10th", and "Ave". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "Richards" and "St." (though "St." is just "St" in the OCR output). 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth. The OCR has "St" which matches "St." in the ground truth (ignoring punctuation and case). However, there's no mention of "Richards" in the OCR output. The OCR has "W 42" and "10th Ave", which are different words. 

Since the ground truth's unique words are "Richards" and "St", and the OCR only has "St" but not "Richards", that means only one of the two required words is present. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. 

Wait, but the problem says to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Richards" and "St". The OCR output has "St" (which is a match) but not "Richards". So only one out of two words match. Therefore, it's partially correct, category 2.
