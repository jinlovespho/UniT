gt_text: OPEN
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"KFC"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OPEN". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are: KFC". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The part after the colon is "KFC". So the extracted text is "KFC".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "OPEN". The unique words in the ground truth are just "OPEN". The OCR output has "KFC". Are these considered matches? 

The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But "OPEN" and "KFC" are completely different words. There's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, they aren't similar. For example, if the OCR had "OPE" or "OPEN" with a typo, that would count, but "KFC" is a different word entirely. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
