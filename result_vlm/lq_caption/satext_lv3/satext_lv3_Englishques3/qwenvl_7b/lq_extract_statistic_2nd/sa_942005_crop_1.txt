Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "V10" and the OCR output is also "V10". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "V10", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only compare the set of unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, it's just one word: "V10". The OCR output is the same. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"V10"}. The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's a match. The other conditions like case, spacing, etc., don't apply here because both are exactly the same. There are no typos either. 

So the answer should be category 1.
