gt_text: SAMSUNG
vlm_output: JBL

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SAMSUNG" and the VLM OCR output is "JBL". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "JBL". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SAMSUNG" since it's one word. The OCR output is "JBL", which is a different word.

Now, considering the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But here, the OCR output has "JBL" instead of "SAMSUNG". There's no overlap. The rules mention that small typos count as matches, but "JBL" isn't a typo of "SAMSUNG"; they are completely different words. Also, ignoring capitalization and spacing, but both are single words here. So there are no matching words. 

Therefore, category 3 applies because there are no matches. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
