Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "101" and the VLM OCR output is also "101". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "101".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are single words. So even if order didn't matter, they're the same. Also, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "101". The OCR output also has "101". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But there's no capitalization here, no punctuation, and no spaces. So that's not an issue. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
