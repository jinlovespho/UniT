gt_text: OYO

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "OYO" and a VLM OCR output "OYO". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. Since the OCR output is "OYO", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "OYO".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth "OYO", the unique words here are just "OYO" (since it's a single word). The OCR output is also "OYO", so the words are exactly the same. There's no difference in capitalization (both are uppercase), no extra or missing spaces (both are three letters with no spaces), and no typos. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all unique words match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty.

Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, all unique words (which is just one word here) are present. Therefore, this should fall into category 1. There's no partial match or any issues mentioned in the criteria. The answer should be 1.
