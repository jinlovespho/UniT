gt_text: 136
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "136", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100" within quotes, but the rest is descriptive text like "The visible English words and letters in the image are:" So the actual extracted text would be "100" since that's the number in quotes. Wait, but maybe the OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are: "100"" — so the text content here is "100" as the main number mentioned. But the user says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is a sentence that includes the number 100. So the extracted text would be "100".

Now, the ground truth is "136". The unique words in the ground truth are just "136" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output's extracted text is "100". Comparing these, "100" vs "136". The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "136", and the OCR output has "100", there's no match. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But "100" and "136" are different numbers. There's no typo here; they are entirely different. So no match. Therefore, the category would be 3.
