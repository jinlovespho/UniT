Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "28" and the VLM OCR output is also "28". The task is to determine the category based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "28", that's straightforward. Now, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the order was different, it wouldn't affect the result here. But in this case, both are the same.

Next, the comparison should be based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "28", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "28", so the unique words match exactly. The criteria also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, there are no capital letters, punctuation, or spaces to consider. The text is just the number 28 in both cases.

Small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not an issue. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Therefore, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "28") are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are the same, this fits perfectly. There's no partial match or no match here. So the answer should be Category 1.
