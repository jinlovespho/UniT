gt_text: APA
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```10```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "APA" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```10```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "10" inside backticks, but the rest is descriptive text like "The visible text in the image is:". So the actual extracted text here is "10".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "APA". The unique words in the ground truth are just "APA" since it's a single word. Now, the OCR output has "10", which is a number. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "APA" is a word and "10" is a number, they don't match. Also, considering that the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth, even if we ignore case, spacing, etc., there's no overlap.

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Here, the OCR output has "10", which isn't related to "APA" at all. So the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 39
2. Slightly Correct Num: 19
3. Incorrect Num: 84
