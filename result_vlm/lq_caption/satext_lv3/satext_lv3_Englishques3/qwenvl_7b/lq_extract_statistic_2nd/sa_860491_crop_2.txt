gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is exactly "POLIZEI".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one word: "POLIZEI". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even though the problem mentions ignoring case, but here both are uppercase, so no issue there. There are no typos, so it's a perfect match. The unique words in ground truth are just "POLIZEI", and the OCR output has that exact word. So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output, this should be category 1. There's no missing words, partial matches, or any issues. So the answer is 1.
