gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth considering certain factors.

First, word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are just one word, so order is the same. Next, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE". The OCR output also has "NIKE". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there's none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small. But there are no typos here; it's exactly the same. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
