gt_text: QUAY FOUR
vlm_output: KFC

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "QUAY FOUR" and the OCR output is "KFC". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "KFC", which is straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "QUAY" and "FOUR". The OCR output has "KFC", which is a single word.

Now, checking if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "QUAY" and "FOUR" are not in "KFC". However, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no overlap in words. The OCR output is entirely different. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 
2 if at least one but not all match (but there are zero matches here), 
3 if no words match or the output is unrelated. 

Since "KFC" doesn't contain "QUAY" or "FOUR", and there's no partial match, the correct category is 3.
