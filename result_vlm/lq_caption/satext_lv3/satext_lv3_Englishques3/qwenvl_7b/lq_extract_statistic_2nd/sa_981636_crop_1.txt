gt_text: 04
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"KTM"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "04", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"KTM"."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KTM" as the visible English words and letters. So the extracted text here is "KTM".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "04". The ground truth has the words "04", which is a number. The OCR output has "KTM", which are letters. 

Looking at the categories:
- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present in the OCR output. The ground truth here is "04", which is a number. The OCR output has letters "K", "T", "M". There's no overlap in characters or words between "04" and "KTM".
- Category 2 is for partial matches. But since the ground truth is a single number and the OCR output has entirely different letters, there's no partial match here either.
- Category 3 is for incorrect outputs where no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "KTM" doesn't match "04" at all, and the OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, this would fall under category 3.

I should also check if there's any possible typo or case-insensitive match. "04" vs "KTM" – even if we consider typos, there's no way "KTM" can be a typo for "04". They are entirely different characters. So, no match here.

Therefore, the correct category is 3.
