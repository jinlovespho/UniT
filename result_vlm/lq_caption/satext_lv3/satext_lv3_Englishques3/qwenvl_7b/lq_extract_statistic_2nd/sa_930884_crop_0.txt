gt_text: AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD
vlm_output: ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD" and the VLM OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". There are no spaces here, but the original ground truth has spaces. But according to the instructions, we should ignore extra or missing spaces. So the OCR output is just the concatenation of the words without spaces.

Next, I need to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

Let's break down the ground truth words. The ground truth has three unique words: "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER", "ETIHAD". The OCR output is "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Let's split this into possible words. Since there are no spaces, we need to see if the OCR output can be split into the same words as the ground truth, possibly with typos.

Looking at the OCR output: "ETIHADAIRWAYSPARTNER". Let's see if we can split this into "ETIHAD", "AIRWAYS", "PARTNER". If we take the first part as "ETIHAD", then "AIRWAYS" would be next, and then "PARTNER". So "ETIHAD" + "AIRWAYS" + "PARTNER" would be the split. 

Now, checking for typos. The ground truth has "ETIHAD", and the OCR output has "ETIHAD" as the first part. So that's a match. Then "AIRWAYS" in the ground truth and the OCR output has "AIRWAYS" as the next part. Then "PARTNER" is in both. 

So all three unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though the OCR output has the words concatenated without spaces, the instructions say to ignore spaces. Also, capitalization is ignored, but both are in uppercase, so that's fine. There are no typos here. So all the words are present. Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
