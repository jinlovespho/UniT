gt_text: ABIAAT
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"VOLLEY"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the ground truth text is "ABIAAT" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are: VOLLEY". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are: VOLLEY". So the actual text here is "VOLLEY". I need to ignore the rest of the sentence and just take "VOLLEY" as the extracted text.

Now step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth, which is "ABIAAT". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words. But wait, the ground truth is "ABIAAT" which is a single word, and the OCR output has "VOLLEY" as a single word. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output (ignoring case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none match or it's unrelated.

So the ground truth is "ABIAAT" and the OCR output is "VOLLEY". Let's check if they match. The words are different. "ABIAAT" vs "VOLLEY". Are there any typos that could make them match? Like maybe "VOLLEY" is a typo for "ABIAAT"? But that doesn't seem likely. The letters are completely different. "ABIAAT" has A, B, I, A, A, T. "VOLLEY" has V, O, L, L, E, Y. No overlapping letters. So there's no match here. 

Therefore, since none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even considering typos, the category would be 3. Because there's no match at all. The OCR output is "VOLLEY" and the ground truth is "ABIAAT", which are entirely different words. So the answer should be 3.
