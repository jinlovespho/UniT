gt_text: RYANAIR KI
vlm_output: Ryanair

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "RYANAIR KI" and the OCR output is "Ryanair". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "Ryanair". Then compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "RYANAIR" and "KI". 

But the OCR output only has "Ryanair". Let's check the unique words in the ground truth. The unique words are "RYANAIR" and "KI". Now, the OCR output has "Ryanair", which is a variation of "RYANAIR" (same word, different capitalization). So that's a match. However, the "KI" part is missing. 

The instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has one of the two words. Since "Ryanair" matches "RYANAIR" (ignoring case), but "KI" is not present. So the OCR output has one unique word matching, but not all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none. Here, only one of the two words is matched. So it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.
