gt_text: HOTEL AVENIDA PALACE
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```python1234567890```It appears to be a sequence of numbers.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOTEL AVENIDA PALACE". The VLM OCR output says the visible text is a sequence of numbers: "python1234567890". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions numbers, so the extracted text would be "python1234567890". 

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: HOTEL, AVENIDA, PALACE. The OCR output has "python" followed by numbers. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output doesn't have any of those words. It has "python" which isn't part of the ground truth. The numbers are just digits, not words. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Also, the categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there were typos, but here the OCR output is completely different. So the answer should be category 3.
