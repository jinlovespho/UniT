gt_text: 936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. The task is to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on how well it matches the ground truth.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES""

Wait, the OCR output is a bit confusing. The user wrote that the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES""

So, the actual extracted text from the OCR would be "RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES". The quotes might be part of the OCR output, but the user's instruction says to extract the text content. However, the ground truth is "936 ATELIER 264 375 ESCRITORIO".

Now, comparing the extracted OCR text ("RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES") with the ground truth. Let's look at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the numbers 936, 264, 375 and the words ATELIER, ESCRITORIO. Wait, but the OCR output has "RUA DOS BANDEIRANTES" which are all Portuguese words. There's no overlap in words between the OCR output and the ground truth. The numbers in the ground truth are not present in the OCR output either. The OCR output is entirely different words, and none of them match the words in the ground truth. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth words are ATELIER, ESCRITORIO. The OCR output has RUA, DOS, BANDEIRANTES. None of these match. So, no words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since none of the words from the ground truth are in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth, as they are completely different words and numbers.
