Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FABBRI PIAZZETTA" and the OCR output is "104". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "104", which is a number. The ground truth is two words, "FABBRI" and "PIAZZETTA". 

Next, comparing them according to the given rules. The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the OCR output is just numbers. The ground truth words are names, probably proper nouns. 

The OCR output doesn't have any letters, just numbers. So, there's no overlap in terms of words. Even if we consider typos or ignore case, the OCR output is entirely numeric. The unique words in the ground truth are "FABBRI" and "PIAZZETTA", which are not present in "104". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "104" doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth, even with typos or case changes, it's unrelated. So the answer should be category 3.
