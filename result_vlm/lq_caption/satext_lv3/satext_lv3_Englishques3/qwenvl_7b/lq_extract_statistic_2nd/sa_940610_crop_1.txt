gt_text: GROVE HOTEL THE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GROVE HOTEL THE" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"".

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" as the visible words. So, the extracted text is just "THE".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "GROVE", "HOTEL", and "THE". The OCR output only has "THE".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "GROVE", "HOTEL", and "THE".

The OCR output has "THE", which is one of the unique words. But the other two words, "GROVE" and "HOTEL", are not present. The rules mention that if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2 (partially correct). Since only one out of three words matches, that would be category 2.

Wait, but the OCR output might have other words? Let me check again. The OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"". So the actual extracted text is just "THE". The rest is part of the OCR's description, not the extracted text. So the extracted text is only "THE".

Therefore, only "THE" is present. The other words from the ground truth are missing. So, since only one of the three unique words is present, it's category 2.
