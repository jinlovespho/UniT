gt_text: HEYKERS
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "SUV" (partially visible on the car's side)- "R" (partially visible on the car's side)

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "HEYKERS" and the VLM OCR output mentions "SUV" and "R" as partially visible. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there are two things: "SUV" on the car's side and "R" also on the car's side. So the extracted text would be "SUV" and "R".

Next, comparing these with the ground truth "HEYKERS". The instructions say to consider unique words in the ground truth. Wait, "HEYKERS" is a single word, right? So the unique words in the ground truth are just "HEYKERS". But the OCR output has "SUV" and "R". 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. We need to check if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words, ignoring case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

Looking at "HEYKERS" versus "SUV" and "R". None of these letters or words are present in the OCR output. "HEYKERS" is a single word, and the OCR found "SUV" and "R". There's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, "SUV" and "R" don't resemble "HEYKERS" in any way. 

So, the category would be 3 because none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR didn't find any of the words from the ground truth. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
