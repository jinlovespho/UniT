gt_text: Canon
vlm_output: CANON

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Canon" and the VLM OCR output is "CANON". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "CANON".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. Also, I should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The ground truth has "Canon" and the OCR has "CANON". If I ignore capitalization, both are the same word. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Canon". The OCR output has "CANON", which is the same word when case is ignored. There are no typos here, just uppercase letters. The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo, just case difference. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (after considering case), this should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. The output isn't empty, and it's related. So the answer should be 1.
