gt_text: Jobs
vlm_output: Jobs

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text of "Jobs" and a VLM OCR output of "Jobs". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "Jobs", so the extracted text is straightforward.

Moving to Step 2, which involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The key points here are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare the set of unique words from the ground truth, and we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "Jobs" and the OCR output is also "Jobs". Let's break this down. Both are the same word. Since the comparison is based on the set of unique words, and the OCR output contains exactly the same word as the ground truth, all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Even though the criteria mention ignoring case, but in this case, both are uppercase "J" and lowercase "obs", so it's the same. There are no typos here, so it's a perfect match. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one unique word ("Jobs") and the OCR output has the same, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
