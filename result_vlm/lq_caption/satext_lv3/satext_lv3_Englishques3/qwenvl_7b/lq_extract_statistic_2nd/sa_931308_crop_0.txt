gt_text: Platform
vlm_output: Platform 1

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Platform" and the VLM OCR output is "Platform 1". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "Platform 1". So the extracted text is "Platform 1".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Platform". The OCR output has "Platform" and "1". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Platform". The OCR output has two words: "Platform" and "1". 

Now, we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "Platform", which is present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "1", isn't part of the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking if the ground truth words are present. 

The instructions also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, "Platform" in the OCR is the same as in the ground truth, so that's a match. The "1" is a number, but since the ground truth doesn't have it, it's irrelevant. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has an extra word, but the ground truth only requires that all its unique words are present. Since "Platform" is there, the category should be 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the ground truth is "Platform" and the OCR has "Platform 1". The category is based on the unique words in the ground truth. Since "Platform" is present, even though there's an extra word, the answer is still category 1. The presence of extra words doesn't affect the category as long as all required words are there. So the answer is 1.
