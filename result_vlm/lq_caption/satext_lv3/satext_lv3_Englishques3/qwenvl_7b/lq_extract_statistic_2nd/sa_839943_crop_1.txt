gt_text: 36 36 36
vlm_output: F-14

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "36 36 36" and the VLM OCR output is "F-14". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "F-14". Then, I have to compare this with the ground truth, following the given guidelines.

The ground truth has three instances of "36". The unique words here are just "36". The OCR output is "F-14". Now, considering the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But since the ground truth has only "36", and the OCR output has "F-14", there's no match here. 
- The unique words in ground truth are ["36"], and the OCR output has ["F-14"]. These are different. 
- Ignoring capitalization and punctuation: "F-14" doesn't resemble "36" in any way. 
- Typos aren't applicable here because "F-14" isn't a typo of "36". 

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words.
