gt_text: pttstation
vlm_output: pttstation

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "pttstation" and the VLM OCR output is also "pttstation". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, they are the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "pttstation" since it's one word. The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are lowercase here. Also, no punctuation or extra spaces. The typo part says small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. There's no missing words, and everything matches. So the answer should be 1.
