gt_text: km/h
vlm_output: 0 km/h

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "km/h" and the VLM OCR output is "0 km/h". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "0 km/h". So the extracted text is "0 km/h".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "km/h". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, I should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "km/h".

Now, looking at the OCR output, "0 km/h". The unique words here are "0" and "km/h". The ground truth's unique word is "km/h", which is present in the OCR output. The "0" is an extra number, but the instructions mention that extra spaces or words might be ignored? Wait, the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but what about extra words? Let me check the guidelines again.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "km/h" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "km/h" as well. The presence of "0" is an extra word, but since the comparison is only about the unique words in the ground truth, the OCR output includes that word. So even though there's an extra "0", the required word "km/h" is present.

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The OCR output has "km/h" exactly as in the ground truth. The "0" is an additional number, but the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "km/h" is present in the OCR output, and the other words (like "0") are not part of the ground truth's unique words, but the presence of the required word is there.

Therefore, according to category 1: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. So the answer should be 1.
