gt_text: Keep clear
vlm_output: !

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Keep clear". The OCR output from the VLM is just "!".

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is an exclamation mark, which is a punctuation symbol, not a word. So the extracted text is just "!".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Keep" and "clear". The instructions say to consider unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if any of these words are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, punctuation, spacing, and considering small typos.

But the OCR output is just "!", which is punctuation. There's no word here. Even if we consider that maybe the OCR misread something, like if the exclamation was meant to be a letter, but the problem states to compare based on the extracted text. Since the OCR output is "!", there are no words in it. 

The categories are:
1: All unique ground truth words are present.
2: At least one but not all.
3: No words match or output is unrelated/empty.

Since the OCR output has no words, it's category 3. Even if the output was empty, that's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
