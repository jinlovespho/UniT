Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The given OCR output is a long string that starts with "The visible English words and letters in the image are:" followed by a series of quoted words like "THE", "OF", "AND", etc. The user mentioned that Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So, I should focus on the part after the colon, which lists all those words. The OCR output seems to be listing words like "THE", "OF", "AND", "TO", "WITH", "BY", "FOR", "IN", "ON", "AT" repeated multiple times. Let me count how many times each word is listed. 

Looking at the OCR output: "THE""OF""AND""TO""WITH""BY""FOR""IN""ON""AT""THE""OF""AND""TO""WITH""BY""FOR""IN""ON""AT""THE""OF""AND""TO""WITH""BY""FOR""IN""ON""AT""THE""OF""AND""TO""WITH""BY""FOR""IN""ON" — it seems like the sequence "THE", "OF", "AND", "TO", "WITH", "BY", "FOR", "IN", "ON", "AT" is repeated four times. Each of these words is in all caps. 

Now, the ground truth text is "DiGi DiGi DiGi DiGi". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "DiGi" (since it's repeated four times, but we only consider unique ones). Wait, the ground truth is four instances of "DiGi", but the unique words would be {"DiGi"}.

Wait, the problem says in Step 2: Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words from the ground truth are just "DiGi" (assuming that "DiGi" is the only unique word, even though it's repeated four times). 

Now, the OCR output's extracted text is a list of words: THE, OF, AND, TO, WITH, BY, FOR, IN, ON, AT, repeated four times. So the unique words in the OCR output are THE, OF, AND, TO, WITH, BY, FOR, IN, ON, AT. 

Now, the comparison is whether all the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique words are {"DiGi"}. The OCR output has none of those words. The OCR output has words like THE, OF, etc., but not "DiGi" or any variation. 

But wait, the problem says to ignore capitalization, so maybe "DiGi" could be matched with "DIGI" or "digI" if present. However, the OCR output has words like "THE", "OF", etc., but none that are "DiGi" or similar. So the OCR output doesn't have any of the unique ground truth words. 

Therefore, according to the categories: 

Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. But here, the ground truth's unique word is "DiGi", which is not present in the OCR output. 

Category 2: At least one but not all. But in this case, none of the unique ground truth words are present. 

Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. Since the OCR output has words that are all prepositions and articles (THE, OF, AND, etc.), which are unrelated to "DiGi", which seems to be a name or a term. 

So the answer should be category 3.
