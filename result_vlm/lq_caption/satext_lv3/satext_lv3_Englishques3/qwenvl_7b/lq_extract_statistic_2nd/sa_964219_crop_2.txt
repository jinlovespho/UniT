gt_text: HEAD
vlm_output: HEAD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HEAD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HEAD". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "HEAD", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "HEAD".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "HEAD". Now, the comparison has some specific rules. Let me check them again.

The rules say that word order doesn't matter. But since both have only one word, order isn't an issue here. Next, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HEAD". The OCR output also has "HEAD". So the unique words match.

Then, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces. So that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both have the same word, that's all. So category 1 applies here. There's no case where any words are missing. The OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
