gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: DALIAN

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "DALIAN", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DALIAN".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in that aspect.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are the same.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "DALIAN" which is exactly the same as the ground truth, this meets the criteria. Even if there were minor typos, they'd still count, but here there are none.

So, the answer should be category 1.
