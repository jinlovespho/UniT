gt_text: JAGUAR
vlm_output: JAGUAR

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "JAGUAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "JAGUAR". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "JAGUAR".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "JAGUAR".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in this regard.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here since both are the same.

Looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are "JAGUAR", this condition is met.

2 — Partially correct: At least one but not all. Not applicable here because all are matched.

3 — Incorrect: No matches or unrelated. Not the case here.

So the answer should be category 1.
