gt_text: DUBLIN 738264
vlm_output: DUBLIN73826

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DUBLIN 738264" and the VLM OCR output is "DUBLIN73826". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "DUBLIN73826". The ground truth has "DUBLIN" followed by "738264". 

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "DUBLIN" and "738264". However, in the OCR output, it's "DUBLIN73826". 

Wait, the ground truth has "DUBLIN" as a word and "738264" as another. The OCR output has "DUBLIN" and "73826". The numbers are different. The OCR output is missing the last digit (4) in the number part. 

But the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "73826" versus "738264" – that's a missing digit. Is that considered a small typo? The OCR output is missing one digit, but the rest are correct. However, the ground truth's number is 738264, and the OCR has 73826. Since the numbers are different, maybe this is considered a typo. 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "DUBLIN" and "738264". The OCR output has "DUBLIN" and "73826". So, "DUBLIN" is present. The number part is different. But since the OCR output is missing a digit, does that count as a match? The instructions say small typos count as matches, but is missing a digit a typo or a missing part? 

Also, the ground truth has two unique words, but the OCR output has two parts. However, the number in OCR is shorter. If the OCR output's number is considered a typo (like a missing 4), then maybe it's considered a match. But the problem states that small typos still count. However, the number in the OCR is not just a typo but a shorter number. 

Alternatively, maybe the ground truth's number is a single word, and the OCR's number is also a single word. So, the OCR has "DUBLIN" and "73826", but the ground truth has "DUBLIN" and "738264". Since the OCR's number is missing the last digit, is that considered a typo? If so, then "73826" is a typo of "738264", but that's a missing character. However, the instructions say "small typos still count as matches." But I'm not sure if missing a digit is considered a small typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is missing the "4" at the end. If the OCR output is supposed to capture the entire number, but it's missing one digit, perhaps that's considered a partial match. However, the problem says that if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 1. But in this case, the ground truth has two words: "DUBLIN" and "738264". The OCR has "DUBLIN" and "73826". So, the number part is different. If the OCR's number is a typo (like a missing 4), but the rest is correct, does that count as a match? 

The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR output's number is shorter. If we consider that the OCR output has "73826" instead of "738264", that's missing a digit. But maybe that's considered a typo. However, I'm not sure if the system is supposed to recognize that "73826" is a typo of "738264" (missing a digit) or if it's considered a different number. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is missing the "4" but the rest of the digits are correct. If the OCR output has "73826" and the ground truth has "738264", then the OCR output is missing one digit. However, the problem says that small typos still count. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. 

In the ground truth, the number is "738264", which is six digits. The OCR output has "73826", which is five digits. The OCR output is missing the last digit. If the OCR system is supposed to capture the entire number, then this is a mistake. However, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. But this seems like a missing digit, not a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is "DUBLIN73826" (without a space), while the ground truth is "DUBLIN 738264" (with a space). The OCR output has "DUBLIN" and "73826", but the ground truth has "DUBLIN" and "738264". So, the OCR output has "DUBLIN" correct, but the number is different. 

Since the problem says that the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "DUBLIN" and "738264". The OCR output has "DUBLIN" and "73826". So, "DUBLIN" is a match, but "738264" is not present. However, "73826" is not a match for "738264". Therefore, only one of the two words matches. 

According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer would be 2. 

But wait, the OCR output has "73826" which is similar to "738264". If the system considers that as a typo (missing a 4), then maybe it's considered a match. However, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. But "73826" versus "738264" is not a small typo. It's a missing digit. So, perhaps it's not considered a match. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is considered to have the correct word "DUBLIN" and the number is considered a typo. However, the number is different. So, in that case, only one word matches. Therefore, category 2. 

Therefore, the answer is 2.
