gt_text: SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH
vlm_output: SPIETH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH". The VLM OCR output is just "SPIETH".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "SPIETH".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has three instances of "SPIETH", but the unique word is just "SPIETH" since it's repeated. The OCR output has one instance of "SPIETH".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are {"SPIETH"}. The OCR output's unique words are also {"SPIETH"}.

So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Even though the OCR has fewer instances, the category depends on the presence of the unique words. Since the OCR output has the same unique word, it should be category 1.

Also, considering the other factors: word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored (but both are uppercase here), and there's no punctuation or spacing issues. The OCR output is a single word, but the ground truth has multiple, but since we're checking unique words, it's okay.

So the answer should be 1.
