gt_text: ROVER
vlm_output: ROVER

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "ROVER" and the VLM OCR output is also "ROVER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "ROVER", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ROVER". The OCR output also has "ROVER". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same. Also, small typos count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are exactly the same.

So, the category is 1 because all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. There's only one word, and it matches perfectly. So the answer should be 1.
