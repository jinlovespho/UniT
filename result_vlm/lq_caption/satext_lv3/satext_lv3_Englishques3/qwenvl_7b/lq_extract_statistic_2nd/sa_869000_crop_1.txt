gt_text: BISCAYNE BLVD US
vlm_output: The visible text in the image appears to be "SOUTH".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "BISCAYNE BLVD US" and a VLM OCR output "The visible text in the image appears to be 'SOUTH'." They want me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "SOUTH" is the visible text. So the extracted text is just "SOUTH".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: BISCAYNE, BLVD, and US. The OCR output only has "SOUTH". Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, the OCR output has only one word, and the ground truth has three. So even if order didn't matter, the number of words is different.

- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are BISCAYNE, BLVD, US. The OCR output's unique word is SOUTH. None of these words match. So there's no overlap.

- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc. But even if "SOUTH" was in the ground truth (which it isn't), it's not present here. The ground truth words are BISCAYNE, BLVD, US. The OCR output has SOUTH, which isn't any of those.

- Small typos still count as matches. But since there's no overlap at all, typos aren't an issue here.

So, according to the categories:

- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. Not the case here.

- Category 2: At least one but not all. But there are zero matches. So not category 2.

- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. This fits because the OCR output has none of the ground truth words.

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
