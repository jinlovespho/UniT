gt_text: iPhone
vlm_output: iPhone

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "iPhone" and the VLM OCR output is also "iPhone". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "iPhone".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "iPhone". The OCR output also has "iPhone". So the unique words match.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are exactly "iPhone", so no issues there.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; they're the same.

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, it's category 1. There's no partial match or no match here. The answer should be 1.
