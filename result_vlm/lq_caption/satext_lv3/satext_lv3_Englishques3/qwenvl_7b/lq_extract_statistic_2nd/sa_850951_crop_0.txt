gt_text: GOODERHAM WORTS LIMITED
vlm_output: GOLDENHALL WAY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth is "GOODERHAM WORTS LIMITED" and the OCR output is "GOLDENHALL WAY". The task is to compare them based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "GOLDENHALL WAY". Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter. Also, I should look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: "GOODERHAM", "WORTS", and "LIMITED". The OCR output has two words: "GOLDENHALL" and "WAY".

Now, checking for matches. Let's ignore case, so all letters are lowercase. Ground truth words: gooderham, worts, limited. OCR words: goldenhall, way. 

Looking for any matches. "Gooderham" vs "goldenhall" – these are different. "Worts" vs "way" – also different. "Limited" isn't present either. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. But wait, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, the words are completely different. "Goldenhall" might be a typo for "Gooderham"? Let me check. "Goldenhall" vs "Gooderham" – they don't look similar enough. "Way" doesn't resemble any of the ground truth words either. 

So, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, even considering typos, the category should be 3 – Incorrect. There's no match at all. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth words. Therefore, the answer is 3.
