gt_text: BIGHORN
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"KINGDOM OF THE NORTH"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BIGHORN", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 'KINGDOM OF THE NORTH'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KINGDOM OF THE NORTH" as the visible words. So the extracted text here is "KINGDOM OF THE NORTH".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth, which is "BIGHORN". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "BIGHORN". The OCR output has the words "KINGDOM", "OF", "THE", "NORTH". None of these words are "BIGHORN" or any variation of it. Even if I check for typos or case, "BIGHORN" isn't present. The OCR output's words are all different. 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, it's category 3. Since "BIGHORN" isn't found in "KINGDOM OF THE NORTH", the answer should be 3.
