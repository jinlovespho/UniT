gt_text: GUERLAIN
vlm_output: GUERLAIN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GUERLAIN" and the VLM OCR output is also "GUERLAIN". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "GUERLAIN". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps, so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because the OCR output is exactly the same. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer should be 1.
