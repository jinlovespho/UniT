gt_text: FedEx Express
vlm_output: FedEx

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "FedEx Express" and the OCR output is "FedEx". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR, which is just "FedEx". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two unique words: "FedEx" and "Express". The OCR output has only "FedEx". So, checking the unique words in the ground truth, "FedEx" is present in the OCR, but "Express" is missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or mostly wrong. Since "FedEx" is there but "Express" isn't, that's partially correct. So the category should be 2. Even though the OCR is missing a word, it's not empty or unrelated. So answer 2.
