gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output is also "LIBERTE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "LIBERTE", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "LIBERTE" (assuming it's one word). The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both are exactly the same, there's no issue here. Even if there were a typo, like "Liberte" vs "LIBERTE", it would still count as a match because capitalization is ignored. But in this case, they are identical.

So all unique ground truth words (which is just one word) are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. There's no partial match or no match here. The answer should be 1.
