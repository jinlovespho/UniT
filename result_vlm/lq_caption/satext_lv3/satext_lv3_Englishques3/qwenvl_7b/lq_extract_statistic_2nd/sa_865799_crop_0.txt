gt_text: EY
vlm_output: EY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EY" and the VLM OCR output is also "EY". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "EY", that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. Both texts are just two letters, so order isn't an issue here. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EY". The OCR output also has "EY", which is the same. 

Now, checking for case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and no spaces. The problem says to ignore these, so they don't affect the comparison.

Typos are mentioned as still counting as matches if they're small. But in this case, there are no typos because both are exactly the same.

Since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "EY") are present in the OCR output, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. There's no missing words or partial matches here. So the category is 1.
