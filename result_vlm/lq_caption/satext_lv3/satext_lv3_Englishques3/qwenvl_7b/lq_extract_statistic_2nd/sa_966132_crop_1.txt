Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRAI". The VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"100%"These appear to be part of a label or sticker, possibly indicating a percentage or a rating." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100%" and talks about a label or sticker indicating a percentage or rating. But the actual text content here is "100%" and some descriptive phrases. However, the user wants the extracted text, which might be the actual words or numbers recognized. Wait, the OCR output is a description of what's in the image. The user might be referring to the OCR's extracted text, but in this case, the OCR output is a sentence describing the image, not the actual text from the image. Hmm, maybe I need to parse the OCR output for any text that's part of the image. The OCR output says "visible English words and letters... are: '100%'". So the actual extracted text from the image is "100%", and the rest is the model's description. 

So Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That would be "100%" as that's the part in quotes. The rest is the model's explanation. 

Now Step 2: Compare this extracted text ("100%") with the ground truth "MIRAI". The unique words in the ground truth are just "MIRAI". The OCR output's extracted text is "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Comparing based on the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any unique words from the ground truth are present. However, "MIRAI" is not present in "100%". The OCR output's text is "100%", which is a number, not the word "MIRAI". So there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output's extracted text is "100%", which doesn't include "MIRAI", the answer should be category 3.
