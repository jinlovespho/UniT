gt_text: 100%
vlm_output: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "100%", and the VLM OCR output is also "100%". So step one is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to step two. The comparison needs to consider that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, there's only one word: "100%". Since both the ground truth and OCR output have the same word, even if there were differences in order (though there's only one word here), it would still match. 

The instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "100%". The OCR output also has that same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But here, the punctuation is the same, and there's no spacing to consider since it's a single word. Also, typos are considered as matches if they're small, but in this case, there are no typos. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since both are exactly the same, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
