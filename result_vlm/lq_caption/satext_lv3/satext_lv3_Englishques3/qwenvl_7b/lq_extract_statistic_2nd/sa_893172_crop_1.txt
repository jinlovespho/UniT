gt_text: VALENCIA
vlm_output: MENSAJES

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "VALENCIA" and the VLM OCR output is "MENSAJES". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "MENSAJES". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one word: "VALENCIA". The OCR output has one word: "MENSAJES".

Now, checking if there are any matches. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both words are in uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation. However, "VALENCIA" and "MENSAJES" are different words. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all match, and 3 if none match or the output is unrelated. Since there's no match between "VALENCIA" and "MENSAJES", the category should be 3. Even though both are single words, they are completely different. No typos here, as the words are entirely different. So the answer is 3.
