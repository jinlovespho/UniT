gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: RESTAURACJA

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "RESTAURACJA".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "RESTAURACJA" is a single word. The OCR output is the same word. So, the unique words in the ground truth are just {"RESTAURACJA"}. The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth (exactly the same word), and there are no differences in capitalization, spacing, or typos, this should fall under category 1. The key points here are that all unique words are present, and the rules about order, case, spacing, and small typos don't affect the match here. There's no partial match or missing words. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
