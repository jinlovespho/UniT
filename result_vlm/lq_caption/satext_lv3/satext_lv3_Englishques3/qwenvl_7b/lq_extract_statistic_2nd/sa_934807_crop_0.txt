gt_text: TUL
vlm_output: T

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TUL" and the VLM OCR output is "T". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "T". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The ground truth has the words "T", "U", "L" if we split by letters, but wait, the ground truth is "TUL" as a single word? Or is it three separate words? Hmm, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". So if "TUL" is considered a single word, then the OCR output has "T" which is a single letter. But the ground truth is "TUL" as one word. So the OCR output has "T" which is part of the ground truth word, but not the whole word. 

Wait, but the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "TUL" as one word, then the unique words are just "TUL". The OCR output is "T", which is a different word. But the problem says that small typos still count as matches. However, "T" is not a typo of "TUL", it's missing letters. So maybe "T" is not considered a match for "TUL".

Alternatively, maybe the ground truth is split into individual letters as words. But that's unclear. The example given in the problem might clarify. Let me check the categories again. Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to appear in OCR output. If the ground truth is "TUL", and the OCR output is "T", then the unique word in ground truth is "TUL", which is not present in OCR output. Therefore, category 3 would be incorrect because no words match. But maybe the OCR output is "T" which is part of the ground truth word. However, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words. So if the ground truth has "TUL" as a single word, then the OCR output has "T" which is not a match. Therefore, no words match, so category 3. But maybe the ground truth is split into individual letters? If that's the case, then the ground truth words are "T", "U", "L", and the OCR output has "T" which matches one of them. Then category 2, since at least one word matches but not all. But the problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If "TUL" is considered a single word, then the unique words are ["TUL"], and the OCR output has ["T"], which doesn't match. But if the ground truth is split into letters, then it's three words. The problem statement isn't clear. However, the example given in the problem might help. The user provided "TUL" as ground truth and "T" as OCR output. If we consider that the OCR output is missing letters, but maybe the OCR is supposed to recognize the entire word. Since the OCR output is "T" and the ground truth is "TUL", it's missing two letters. So the OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words (assuming "TUL" is one word). Therefore, category 3. But if the OCR output is "T" and the ground truth is split into "T", "U", "L", then the OCR output has one matching word. But how to know if the ground truth is one word or three? The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If the ground truth is "TUL", then it's one word. So the OCR output has "T" which is not a match. Therefore, category 3. But maybe the OCR output is considered to have "T" which is part of the ground truth word, but the instructions don't mention partial matches. The instructions say small typos still count as matches. For example, "TUL" vs "TUL" is correct. If the OCR output was "TUL" but with a typo like "TUL" vs "TUL", that's correct. But if the OCR output is "T", it's not a typo of "TUL", it's missing letters. So the answer would be category 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
