gt_text: PONANT
vlm_output: PONANT

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PONANT" and the VLM OCR output is also "PONANT". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "PONANT".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PONANT". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mentioned ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Also, there are no typos here. So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
