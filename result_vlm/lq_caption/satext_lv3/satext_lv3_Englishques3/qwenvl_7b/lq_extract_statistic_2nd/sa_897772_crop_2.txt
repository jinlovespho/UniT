gt_text: 8
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:Jockey

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "8", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:Jockey". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:Jockey". So the extracted text would be "The visible text in the image is Jockey" if I remove the colon, but maybe the colon is part of the text. Wait, the original output is "The visible text in the image is:Jockey". The colon might be part of the OCR's output, but the user's instruction says to extract the text content. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "8", which is a single word, a number.

Now, the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "8". The OCR output's text is "The visible text in the image is:Jockey". Let's extract the words here. Breaking it down: "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "Jockey". But the ground truth is "8", which is a number. The OCR output has no numbers. So the unique words in the OCR output are The, visible, text, in, image, is, Jockey. None of these are "8". 

The category is determined by whether the OCR output contains all unique ground truth words. Since the ground truth has "8" and the OCR output doesn't have that, there's no match. Therefore, category 3: Incorrect. Even though there's a word "Jockey", that's not related to "8". Also, the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "8" is a number, and the OCR output has no numbers. So no words match. Hence, category 3.
