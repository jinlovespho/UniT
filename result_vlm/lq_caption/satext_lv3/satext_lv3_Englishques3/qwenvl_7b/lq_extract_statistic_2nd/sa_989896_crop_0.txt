gt_text: RATOWNICTWO DROGOWE
vlm_output: The visible text in the image appears to be "TNT".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RATOWNICTWO DROGOWE" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image appears to be "TNT"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "TNT" is the visible text. So the extracted text is "TNT".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "RATOWNICTWO" and "DROGOWE". The OCR output has "TNT". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so I just check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But "RATOWNICTWO" and "DROGOWE" don't contain "TNT" as a substring. Also, the OCR output is "TNT", which isn't related to the ground truth words. 

The rules mention that small typos still count, but in this case, there's no overlap. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. So, according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3.
