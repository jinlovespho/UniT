gt_text: TOKYO
vlm_output: TOKYO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TOKYO" and the VLM OCR output is also "TOKYO". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "TOKYO".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has some specific rules. Let me break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are single words, so order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TOKYO".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

Now, the categories are:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. Since the OCR output has "TOKYO" which matches exactly, this fits category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so all conditions for category 1 are met. There's no partial match or errors. So the answer should be 1.
