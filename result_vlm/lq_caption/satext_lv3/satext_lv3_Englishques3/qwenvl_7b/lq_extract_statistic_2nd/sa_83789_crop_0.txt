Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "32" and the VLM OCR output is also "32". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "32", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "32".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, both the ground truth and OCR output are exactly the same. 

The ground truth has the word "32". The OCR output also has "32". Since they are identical, all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "32") are present in the OCR output. There are no typos, no missing words, and no extra words. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
