gt_text: AIA CCB
vlm_output: AIA

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth is "AIA CCB" and the OCR output is "AIA". First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "AIA".

Next, I need to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "AIA" and "CCB". The OCR output has "AIA" but not "CCB". 

The rules mention that we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output must have all the unique words from the ground truth to be category 1. Here, "AIA" is present, but "CCB" is missing. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or mostly wrong. Since "AIA" is a match and "CCB" isn't, that's one out of two. So, it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 217
2. Slightly Correct Num: 113
3. Incorrect Num: 587
