gt_text: in
vlm_output: in

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "in".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "in". The OCR output also has "in". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are lowercase and there's no punctuation or spaces, that's not an issue here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

So, according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since the OCR output matches exactly, the answer should be 1.
