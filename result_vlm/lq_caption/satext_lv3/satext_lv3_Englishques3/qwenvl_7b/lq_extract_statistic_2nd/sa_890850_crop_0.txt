gt_text: OUTBACK SUPER-LITE
vlm_output: OUTBACK

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE" and the OCR output is "OUTBACK". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "OUTBACK". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". 

Now, checking the OCR output. It has "OUTBACK", which is one of the words. But "SUPER-LITE" is missing. The categories are based on whether all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output only has one of the two words, that would mean it's partially correct. 

Wait, the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, the OCR output is missing "SUPER-LITE", so it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since "OUTBACK" is present, that's one match. So category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. Here, one does match, so not 3. 

So the answer should be 2.
