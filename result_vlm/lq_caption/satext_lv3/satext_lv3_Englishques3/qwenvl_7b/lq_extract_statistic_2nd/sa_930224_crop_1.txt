gt_text: EAO HY18
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"KJ 123456"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EAO HY18", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English word in the image is:"KJ 123456"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KJ 123456" as the visible English word. So the extracted text here is "KJ 123456".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "EAO" and "HY18". The OCR output has "KJ" and "123456".

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches. 

Looking at "EAO" vs. "KJ" – they are different words. "HY18" vs. "123456" – also different. There's no overlap in the unique words. The OCR output doesn't have any of the ground truth words. Even if we consider typos, "KJ" isn't a typo for "EAO" or "HY18", and "123456" isn't a typo for either. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output.

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3 – Incorrect.
