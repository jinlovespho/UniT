gt_text: AC MARRIOTT HOTELS TELS HO
vlm_output: The visible English word in the image is:"UNIVERSITY"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "AC MARRIOTT HOTELS TELS HO" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English word in the image is:"UNIVERSITY"". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here says "The visible English word in the image is: UNIVERSITY". So the extracted text would be "UNIVERSITY". Wait, but the original ground truth has multiple words: AC, MARRIOTT, HOTELS, TELS, HO. 

Now, comparing the extracted text from OCR ("UNIVERSITY") with the ground truth words. The unique words in the ground truth are AC, MARRIOTT, HOTELS, TELS, HO. The OCR output has only the word "UNIVERSITY". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from ground truth. Ignore case, punctuation, spaces. Also, small typos count as matches. But here, "UNIVERSITY" isn't present in the ground truth words. The ground truth words are all different. So none of the ground truth words are in the OCR output. 

Therefore, the category should be 3 because there are no matches. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth words. Even if there were a typo, like if it was "MARRIOTT" but misspelled slightly, but in this case, it's a completely different word. So the answer is 3.
