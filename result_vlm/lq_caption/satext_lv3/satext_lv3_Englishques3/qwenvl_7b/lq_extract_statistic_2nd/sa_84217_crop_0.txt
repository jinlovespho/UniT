gt_text: Phedra
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```2```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Phedra" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```2```". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```2```". So the extracted text would be all the words here. Let me list them out: "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "2". But wait, the OCR output might have some formatting, like the backticks around the 2. However, the problem says to ignore punctuation and extra spaces. So maybe the backticks are considered punctuation and can be ignored. So the actual words would be "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "2".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Phedra". The unique words in the ground truth are just "Phedra" (assuming it's one word). 

The comparison rules say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if "Phedra" is present in the OCR output. But the OCR output has words like "The", "visible", "text", etc., and the number 2. There's no mention of "Phedra" here. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any word that's close to "Phedra". The closest might be "text" or "image", but those are not related. The number 2 is present, but that's not a word. 

So according to the categories: 
- Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Phedra" isn't there, that's not the case.
- Category 2 is if at least one but not all unique words match. But there are no matches here. The OCR output doesn't have "Phedra" or any of its possible typos. 
- Category 3 is if no words match or the output is unrelated. The OCR output is about visible text and mentions a number, which is unrelated to "Phedra". 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
