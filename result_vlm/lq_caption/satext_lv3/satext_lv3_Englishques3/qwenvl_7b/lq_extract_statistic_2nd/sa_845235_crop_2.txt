gt_text: GALLERY HERE> ENTER
vlm_output: GALLERY

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "GALLERY HERE> ENTER" and the VLM OCR output is just "GALLERY". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "GALLERY". 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me break down the ground truth. The original text is "GALLERY HERE> ENTER". If I split that into words, considering that "HERE>" might be a typo or a separator, but the instructions mention ignoring punctuation. So "HERE>" would be treated as "HERE" without the punctuation. Similarly, "ENTER" is a separate word. So the unique words in the ground truth are "GALLERY", "HERE", and "ENTER".

Now, the OCR output is "GALLERY". So the unique words here are just "GALLERY". 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all match.
3 if none or it's unrelated.

In this case, the OCR output has "GALLERY" which matches the ground truth's "GALLERY". However, the ground truth has two more words: "HERE" and "ENTER". The OCR output doesn't have these. So only one of the three unique words is present. That would be category 2—partially correct. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has three unique words. The OCR output has one. Since only one matches (GALLERY), that's at least one but not all. So category 2. 

I need to make sure I didn't miss any typos. The OCR output is exactly "GALLERY", which is correct. No typos there. The other words in the ground truth are "HERE" and "ENTER", which aren't present. So yes, category 2.
