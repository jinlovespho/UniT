gt_text: 110 112
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"Rally"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "110 112", which are two numbers. The VLM OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 'Rally'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Rally" as the visible text. So the extracted text is "Rally".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has "110" and "112", which are numbers. The OCR output has the word "Rally". 

Looking at the categories: 

- Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. The ground truth words are "110" and "112", which are numbers. The OCR output has "Rally", which is a word. There's no match here. 

- Category 2 is if at least one word matches. But "Rally" doesn't match either "110" or "112". Even if we consider typos, "Rally" isn't close to those numbers. 

- Category 3 is when there's no match or the output is unrelated. Since "Rally" is unrelated to the numbers in the ground truth, this falls under category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
