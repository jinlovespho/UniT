gt_text: HUBERT
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"ZURICH"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HUBERT" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"ZURICH"."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here seems to have a part that says "ZURICH" enclosed in quotes. The rest of the text is a description, like "The visible English words and letters in the image are:" which probably isn't part of the actual extracted text. So the main extracted text here is "ZURICH".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HUBERT". Now, according to the instructions, word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HUBERT".

The OCR output has "ZURICH". Now, I need to check if "ZURICH" matches "HUBERT" considering the rules. The rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "ZURICH" and "HUBERT" are different words. Even if we ignore case, they are still different. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, it's not a typo—it's a completely different word.

So, the OCR output has "ZURICH" which isn't related to "HUBERT". Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is largely wrong or unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
