gt_text: FLiXBUS
vlm_output: FLIXBUS

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FLiXBUS" and the VLM OCR output is "FLIXBUS". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "FLIXBUS".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "FLiXBUS". So the unique words here are just that one word. The OCR output is "FLIXBUS", which is the same letters but with 'i' instead of 'i' (but wait, the original has 'i' in lowercase? Let me check again. Ground truth is "FLiXBUS"—so the 'i' is lowercase. OCR output is "FLIXBUS"—the 'I' is uppercase? Or is it lowercase? Wait, the OCR output is "FLIXBUS". Let me check the case. Ground truth: F, L, i (lowercase), X, B, U, S. OCR output: F, L, I (uppercase?), X, B, U, S. Wait, but the problem says to ignore capitalization. So case doesn't matter. So "FLiXBUS" vs "FLIXBUS"—they are the same when case is ignored. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. So even if there's a typo, like a missing or extra letter, but here the only difference is the case of the 'i' (lowercase vs uppercase), which is ignored. So the OCR output has the same letters as the ground truth, just case difference, which is allowed. Therefore, the unique word in the ground truth is present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words (which is just one) are present, the category is 1—Correct.
