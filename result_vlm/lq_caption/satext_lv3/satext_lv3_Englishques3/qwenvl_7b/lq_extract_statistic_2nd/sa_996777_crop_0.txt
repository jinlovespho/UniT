gt_text: GOVERNADOR PALÁCIO DO
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```HOTEL```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GOVERNADOR PALÁCIO DO". The VLM OCR output is "HOTEL". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR says "HOTEL". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: GOVERNADOR, PALÁCIO, DO. 

The OCR output has only one word: HOTEL. Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

Looking at the words: "GOVERNADOR" vs "HOTEL" – no match. "PALÁCIO" vs "HOTEL" – no match. "DO" vs "HOTEL" – no match. So none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since none of the words match, the answer should be category 3.
