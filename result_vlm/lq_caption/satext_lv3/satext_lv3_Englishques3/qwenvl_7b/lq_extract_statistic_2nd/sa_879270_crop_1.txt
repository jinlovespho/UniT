gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: EVERGREEN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "EVERGREEN". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "EVERGREEN". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and single word. So they match exactly. Even if there were small typos, like "EVERGREEN" vs "EVERGReen", it would still count as a match. Since there's no difference here, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, this should be category 1 because all unique words match. There's no partial match or no match here. The answer should be 1.
