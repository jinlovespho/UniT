gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: NIKE

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE" and the VLM OCR output is also "NIKE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NIKE".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "NIKE", which is a single word. The OCR output is also "NIKE". Since they are identical, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "NIKE". The OCR output has "NIKE" as well. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both are the same, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
