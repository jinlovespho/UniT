gt_text: this morning
vlm_output: his morning

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "this morning" and the VLM OCR output is "his morning". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "his morning". Then compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I can ignore the order of the words. The ground truth has two unique words: "this" and "morning". The OCR output has "his" and "morning". 

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth's "this" is in the OCR output as "his". The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. "His" is a typo of "this", right? So that's a match. Then "morning" is exactly the same in both. So both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, just with a typo in one. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some do, 3 if none. Since both words match (with a typo allowed), the category should be 1. I think that's correct. Let me check again. Ground truth words: "this", "morning". OCR has "his", "morning". "His" is a typo of "this", so it counts. So all unique words are there. So answer is 1.
