gt_text: VITAFLEX
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:"Rome"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "VITAFLEX". The VLM OCR output says "The visible text in the image is: Rome". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Rome" as the visible text. So the extracted text is "Rome".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "VITAFLEX". The unique words in the ground truth are just "VITAFLEX" since it's one word. The OCR output has "Rome" as the extracted text. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "VITAFLEX" isn't in the OCR output, and "Rome" is different. Also, considering typos, but "Rome" isn't even close to "VITAFLEX". So there's no match here. 

The categories are: 1 if all words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match. Since there are no matching words, it's category 3.
