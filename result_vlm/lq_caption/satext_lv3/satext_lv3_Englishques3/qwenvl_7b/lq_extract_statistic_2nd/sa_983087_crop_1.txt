gt_text: BONIA
vlm_output: BONIA

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BONIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "BONIA". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "BONIA".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "BONIA" since it's a single word. The OCR output also has "BONIA", so all unique words from the ground truth are present. The other considerations like capitalization, punctuation, and spacing aren't an issue here because both are the same. There are no typos mentioned, so that's a match.

Looking at the categories, since all unique words match, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words. So the answer should be 1.
