gt_text: MEDELLIN

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MEDELLIN" and the VLM OCR output is also "MEDELLIN". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "MEDELLIN", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. However, in this case, both texts are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MEDELLIN". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps with no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is identical to the ground truth.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since both have the same single word, this meets Category 1. There's no partial match or no match here. 

Therefore, the answer should be 1.
