gt_text: Rodeo
vlm_output: Rodeo

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rodeo" and the VLM OCR output is also "Rodeo". So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Rodeo".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Rodeo". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are exactly the same in this case. There's no mention of typos, but the OCR output matches exactly. So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, the answer should be 1.
