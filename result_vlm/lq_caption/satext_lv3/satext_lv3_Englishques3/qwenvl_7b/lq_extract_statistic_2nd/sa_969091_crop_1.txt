Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth is "Duke UNIVERSITY" and the OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules provided.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "DukeUNIVERSITY". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output combines them into one word: "DukeUNIVERSITY". But the instructions say that word order doesn't matter and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the OCR output isn't splitting the words correctly. Wait, the OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY" which is a single word, but the ground truth has two words. But according to the rules, we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos.

Wait, but the OCR output is missing the space between "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". However, the rules say to ignore extra or missing spaces. So even if the OCR output has no space, but the words are present as parts of the OCR text, maybe it's considered a match. But how?

The ground truth words are "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". So, does "DukeUNIVERSITY" contain both "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY" as substrings? If we split the OCR output into possible words, but the rules don't mention splitting into words, only considering the set of unique words from the ground truth. Wait, the instruction says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has two unique words: "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output must contain both of these words, ignoring case, spacing, etc.

But the OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". If we consider that the OCR output might have merged the two words into one, but the words themselves are present as parts of the OCR text. However, the problem is that the OCR output is a single word, not two. But the rules say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe even if there's no space, the presence of both words as substrings would count? But the rules don't specify that. Let me recheck the instructions.

The user says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". So the OCR output has "Duke" as the beginning part and "UNIVERSITY" as the end part. But are these considered as separate words in the OCR output? Since the OCR output is a single word, but the ground truth has two. However, the rules say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output is considered to have both words, even if they are merged. Wait, but that's not how it works. For example, if the OCR output was "DukeUNIVERSITY", it's a single token, not two. Unless the OCR is supposed to split into words, but the problem doesn't mention that. The instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output contains both "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY" as words (regardless of spacing), then it's a correct match. But in this case, the OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY", which is a single word. However, the rules say that we can ignore extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output doesn't have a space between the two words. However, the rules also mention that small typos still count as matches. So perhaps the OCR output is considered to have both words, even if they are merged, because the words are present as parts of the text. Wait, but that might be stretching it. Let me think again.

Another approach: The ground truth words are "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY". So the OCR output contains both "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY" as substrings. However, the rules don't specify that the OCR output needs to have the words as separate tokens, just that the set of unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, ignoring case, spacing, etc. So if the OCR output contains both words as parts of the text, even if they are merged, then it's considered a correct match. But this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is supposed to have the words in any order, but as separate words. However, since the OCR output is a single word, maybe it's not considered to have both words. But the rules say to ignore spacing, so maybe the missing space is considered as a typo. Wait, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. So if the OCR output is missing a space between "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY", that's a typo but still counts as a match. Therefore, the OCR output would be considered to have both words, even if they are merged. Therefore, both words are present, so category 1.

But another angle: the OCR output is "DukeUNIVERSITY" which is a single word, but the ground truth has two words. However, the rules don't require the OCR output to have the same number of words. It just needs to have all the unique words from the ground truth. So even if the OCR output has merged them, as long as the words are present (as substrings), it's acceptable. Therefore, the answer is category 1.
