gt_text: GALIONE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "T" (appears twice)- "D" (appears twice)

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GALIONE". The VLM OCR output says there are "T" (twice) and "D" (twice). 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the letters T and D, each appearing twice. But the ground truth is the word "GALIONE". 

Now, comparing the extracted text (T and D) with the ground truth. The ground truth has the letters G, A, L, I, O, N, E. The OCR output has T and D. None of these letters are present in the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has T and D, which aren't in GALIONE, there's no match. So it's category 3.
