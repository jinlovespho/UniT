gt_text: 52093 mobile
vlm_output: 52093

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "52093 mobile" and the VLM OCR output is "52093". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "52093". Then compare it to the ground truth.

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has two words: "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output only has "52093". 

So the unique words in the ground truth are "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has "52093" but not "mobile". According to the rules, we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "mobile" is missing, it's not a full match. But the category 2 is for at least one but not all. Here, one word matches ("52093") and one doesn't ("mobile"), so it's partially correct. Therefore, category 2.
