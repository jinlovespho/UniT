gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". So, first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just "Bank", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bank". The OCR output also has "Bank".

Then, we need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same. There's no punctuation or spaces to consider. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they are identical.

So, the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "Bank") are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words, and it's exactly the same. So the answer should be 1.
