gt_text: 251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION
vlm_output: 251

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION" and the OCR output is "251". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "251". 

Next, I have to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into its unique words: "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". 

Now, the OCR output is only "251". So, I need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The number "251" is present in both, but the other words like "DEPT", "OF", and "TRANSPORTATION" are missing. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique words match (which they don't here),
2 if at least one but not all match (which is the case here since only "251" matches),
3 if none match or the output is unrelated. 

Since there's at least one match ("251"), it's category 2. Even though the OCR missed most words, the presence of one unique word from the ground truth qualifies it as partially correct.
