gt_text: Google google.ru
vlm_output: Google

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Google google.ru" and the VLM OCR output is "Google". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "Google". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "Google" and "google.ru". But the OCR output only has "Google". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But the key is to look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Google" and "google.ru". 

Now, the OCR output has "Google", which matches the first word. However, "google.ru" is a domain name, which is a different word. The OCR output didn't capture that. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth's unique words are "Google" and "google.ru". The OCR output has "Google", which is one of them. But does "google.ru" count as a separate word? Yes, because it's a different token. 

So, the OCR output has one of the two unique words. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. But wait, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo—it's just missing a word. 

So, since the OCR output has one of the two unique words from the ground truth, that would be category 2—partially correct. But wait, the ground truth has "google.ru" which is a different word. The OCR output didn't capture that. So only one word matches. Therefore, the answer should be category 2. 

But let me double-check. The OCR output is "Google" and the ground truth is "Google google.ru". The unique words in the ground truth are "Google" and "google.ru". The OCR output has "Google", which is one of them. So, it's at least one match, but not all. Hence, category 2. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is 2.
