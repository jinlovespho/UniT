gt_text: EC MAX
vlm_output: SCAN-AK

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EC MAX" and the VLM OCR output is "SCAN-AK". I need to compare these two according to the given criteria.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "SCAN-AK". So the extracted text is just that string. 

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "EC" and "MAX". The OCR output has "SCAN" and "AK". Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the order was different, it's okay.
- Only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "EC" and "MAX". The OCR output's words are "SCAN" and "AK".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output here has a hyphen, but the ground truth doesn't. However, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. Wait, but the OCR output's words are "SCAN-AK" as a single token, or split into "SCAN" and "AK"? Hmm, maybe the OCR output is split into words. The problem says "extract the text content" from OCR output, which is "SCAN-AK". But how is that split into words? If it's considered as one word "SCAN-AK", then comparing to "EC" and "MAX" would have no matches. But maybe the OCR output is split into "SCAN" and "AK" as two words. But the original OCR output is "SCAN-AK", so maybe it's a single word with a hyphen. 

But according to the instructions, when comparing, we ignore punctuation. So "SCAN-AK" would be treated as "SCAN AK" (ignoring the hyphen). Then, the words would be "SCAN" and "AK". Comparing to the ground truth words "EC" and "MAX", there's no overlap. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 3: Incorrect. 

But wait, maybe the OCR output is considered as "SCAN" and "AK" as two words. But the ground truth is "EC" and "MAX". So no matches. So category 3. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output had "EC" or "MAX" in any form, but "SCAN-AK" doesn't contain those. So no matches. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
