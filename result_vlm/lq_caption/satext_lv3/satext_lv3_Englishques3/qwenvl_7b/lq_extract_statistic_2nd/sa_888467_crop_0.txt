gt_text: CRUISEAMERICA com
vlm_output: CROUSEAMERICA.COM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth is "CRUISEAMERICA com" and the OCR output is "CROUSEAMERICA.COM". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output is "CROUSEAMERICA.COM". Now, comparing this to the ground truth. 

The ground truth has two words: "CRUISEAMERICA" and "com". The OCR output has "CROUSEAMERICA" and "COM" (since the dot is part of the domain, but the problem says to ignore punctuation, so maybe "COM" is considered as "com" when ignoring case and punctuation). 

But wait, the ground truth has "CRUISEAMERICA" and "com". The OCR has "CROUSEAMERICA" and "COM". Let's check the words. 

First, "CRUISEAMERICA" vs "CROUSEAMERICA". The OCR has a typo: "CROUSE" instead of "CRUISE". The problem says small typos still count as matches. So "CROUSEAMERICA" would be considered a match for "CRUISEAMERICA" because it's a small typo. 

Then, "com" vs "COM". Since we ignore capitalization, "COM" is the same as "com". Also, the OCR has "COM" as a single word, while the ground truth has "com" as a separate word. The problem states that word order doesn't matter, so even if the order is different, as long as all unique words are present, it's category 1. 

So the unique words in ground truth are "CRUISEAMERICA" and "com". The OCR has "CROUSEAMERICA" (which is a typo of the first) and "COM" (which is the same as "com" ignoring case). Therefore, both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, considering typos and case. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
