gt_text: MULTIPLEX
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```plaintextS```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MULTIPLEX" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```plaintextS```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```plaintextS```". The part inside the backticks is "S", so the extracted text is just "S".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MULTIPLEX", which is one word. The OCR output has "S". 

Now, considering the comparison rules:
- Word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word each.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "MULTIPLEX" as the only unique word.
- Ignore capitalization: "MULTIPLEX" is uppercase, but the OCR output has "S" lowercase. But even if we consider case-insensitive, "S" vs "MULTIPLEX" don't match.
- Punctuation and spacing: The OCR output has "S" with no punctuation, and the ground truth has no punctuation either. But the words themselves are different.
- Typos: The OCR output has "S" which is a single letter. The ground truth is a longer word. Even if there was a typo, like "S" vs "M", but here it's not even close.

So, the OCR output's extracted text is "S", which doesn't match "MULTIPLEX" in any way. There are no overlapping words. The category would be 3 because no words match, and the output is largely wrong or unrelated. The OCR output is just "S", which is completely different from "MULTIPLEX".
