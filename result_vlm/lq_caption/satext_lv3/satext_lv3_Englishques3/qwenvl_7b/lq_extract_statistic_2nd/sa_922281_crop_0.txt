gt_text: 700
vlm_output: TNT

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "700" and the VLM OCR output is "TNT". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So "TNT" is the extracted text.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is "700", which is a single word. The OCR output is "TNT", which is another single word. 

Now, considering the criteria: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But here, both are single words without any of those. However, the problem is that "700" is a number, and "TNT" is letters. The instruction says small typos still count as matches, but this isn't a typo—it's a completely different set of characters. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are in OCR output. But "700" isn't present in "TNT". The OCR output has "TNT", which is not a match for "700". So no words match here. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "TNT" is unrelated to "700", this would fall under category 3. 

Wait, but the ground truth has only one unique word, "700". The OCR output has "TNT", which is different. So there are no matching words. Therefore, category 3 applies.
