gt_text: EPSON Castrol
vlm_output: EPSON

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "EPSON Castrol" and the OCR output is just "EPSON". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—just "EPSON".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two unique words: "EPSON" and "Castrol". The OCR output has only "EPSON".

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. But here, the OCR output is missing "Castrol". So that's not category 1. 

Category 2 is partially correct if at least one but not all match. The OCR output has "EPSON", which is one of the two words. So that's at least one match. But since "Castrol" is missing, it's not all. So maybe category 2?

Wait, but the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there's no typo in "EPSON"—it's exactly the same. So that's a full match for that word. The other word is missing. So the OCR output has one of the two required words. So according to the categories, that would be category 2: slightly correct, partially correct.

But wait, the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one. So the count is one out of two. So that's partial. Therefore, the answer should be 2.
