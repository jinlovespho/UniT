Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARMY" and the VLM OCR output is also "ARMY". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "ARMY", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "ARMY". The OCR output is the same word. Since both are exactly "ARMY", there's no difference in capitalization, spacing, or typos. The unique words in the ground truth are just "ARMY", and the OCR output contains that same word. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it matches, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. Also, the output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
