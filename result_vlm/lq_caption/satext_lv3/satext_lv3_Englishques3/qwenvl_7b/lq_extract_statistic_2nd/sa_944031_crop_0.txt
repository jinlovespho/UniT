Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is also "105". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "105", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "105".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But wait, in this case, both are just a single number. Since there's only one word, order isn't an issue here. The next point says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "105" as the only unique word. The OCR output also has "105". 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation involved here. Also, the note says small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So for the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has that same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the category should be 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. Even if there were typos, like "105" vs "105" (but they are same), but in this case, they are identical. So definitely category 1.
