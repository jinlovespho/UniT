gt_text: ZK OXF
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```plaintextAir New Zealand```

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ZK OXF". The VLM OCR output says "Air New Zealand". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "Air New Zealand". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "ZK" and "OXF". 

But the OCR output has "Air", "New", and "Zealand". Wait, the ground truth words are "ZK" and "OXF". Are those abbreviations? Maybe "ZK" is a code, like an airport code? And "OXF" might be Oxford? But the OCR output has "Air New Zealand", which is a company name. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "ZK" and "OXF". The OCR output has "Air", "New", "Zealand". None of these words match "ZK" or "OXF". Even if I ignore case, capitalization, etc., there's no overlap. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, since neither "ZK" nor "OXF" are present in the OCR output, even considering typos or other factors, there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3, which is incorrect because no words match.
