gt_text: CHINA EASTERN EASTERN
vlm_output: CHINA EASTERN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CHINA EASTERN EASTERN" and the VLM OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is already given as "CHINA EASTERN", so that's straightforward.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CHINA" and "EASTERN". Even though "EASTERN" is repeated, the unique words are just those two. 

Now, the OCR output has "CHINA" and "EASTERN" as well. So both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are in uppercase, so case doesn't matter. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos mentioned, so the words match exactly.

Since all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. The fact that the OCR output has one fewer instance of "EASTERN" doesn't matter because we're only checking for the presence of unique words, not their frequency.
