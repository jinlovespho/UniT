gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: FRUIT

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "FRUIT", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT". The OCR output also has "FRUIT". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, same spelling, no punctuation or spaces. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but there are no typos here.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches exactly.
