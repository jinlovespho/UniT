gt_text: movistar
vlm_output: movistar

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "movistar" and the VLM OCR output is also "movistar". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "movistar". The OCR output has the same word. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are lowercase here. No punctuation or extra spaces to consider. There are no typos either since they're identical. 

So all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "movistar") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that means it's category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match here because all the required words are there. The answer should be 1.
