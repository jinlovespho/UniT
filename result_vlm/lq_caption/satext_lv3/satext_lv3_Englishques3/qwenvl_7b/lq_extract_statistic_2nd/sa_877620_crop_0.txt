gt_text: ZONE NO FLY
vlm_output: NO FLY ZONE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "ZONE NO FLY" and the VLM OCR output is "NO FLY ZONE". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "NO FLY ZONE". Then, I compare it with the ground truth, considering the specified factors. 

The key points to consider are:
- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different order, it's okay.
- Only the set of unique words in the ground truth should be compared. The ground truth has the words "ZONE", "NO", and "FLY".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "NO" and "no" would be considered the same, and spaces between words don't affect the comparison.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there was a typo like "FLY" vs "FLY", that's okay, but if it was "FLY" vs "FLYI", that might not be, but the problem says small typos still count. However, in this case, there are no typos.

So, let's break down the words. The ground truth has "ZONE", "NO", "FLY". The OCR output has "NO", "FLY", "ZONE". All the words are present, just in a different order. Since the order doesn't matter, and all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

I need to check if there's any missing words. The ground truth has three words, and the OCR output has the same three words. No extra words, no missing words. Also, the capitalization is different but that's ignored. So, all conditions for category 1 are met. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
