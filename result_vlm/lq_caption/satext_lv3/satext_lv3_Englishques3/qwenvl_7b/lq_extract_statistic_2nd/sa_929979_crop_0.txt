gt_text: SCANIA
vlm_output: SCANIA

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SCANIA" and the VLM OCR output is also "SCANIA". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SCANIA". The OCR output also has "SCANIA". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Punctuation and spaces are not an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That would fall under category 1, which is correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
