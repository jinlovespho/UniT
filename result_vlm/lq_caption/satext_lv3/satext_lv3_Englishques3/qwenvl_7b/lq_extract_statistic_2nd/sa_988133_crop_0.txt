gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: UIT

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "UIT". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they are the same. 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "UIT" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output has the same word. Since they are identical, even considering case, spacing, etc., there's no difference. 

The categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, category 1 applies. There's no mention of typos here, but even if there were small typos, the note says they still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. 

So the answer should be 1.
