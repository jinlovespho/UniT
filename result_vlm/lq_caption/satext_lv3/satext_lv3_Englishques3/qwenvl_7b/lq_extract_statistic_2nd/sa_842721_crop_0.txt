gt_text: 30 18
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:123

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "30 18", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:123". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The visible text in the image is:123". So the extracted text here would be "The visible text in the image is:123". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "30 18". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

So the ground truth has two unique words: "30" and "18". Now, looking at the OCR output, the extracted text is "The visible text in the image is:123". Let me break this down. The OCR output has numbers in it, like "123". But the ground truth has "30" and "18". 

Wait, the OCR output's text is "123" but the ground truth is "30 18". So the OCR output's numbers are different. The OCR output doesn't have "30" or "18" in it. The only number is "123". So the unique words in the ground truth are "30" and "18", but the OCR output has "123". 

But the instructions say to consider small typos as matches. However, "123" is not a typo of "30" or "18". It's a completely different number. So there's no match here. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR output has no "30" or "18", and instead has "123", which isn't a match, then there are no matches. So the category would be 3. 

Wait, but the OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:123". The ground truth is "30 18". The OCR output is not empty, but it's not matching any of the ground truth words. The words in the OCR output are "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "123". None of these are "30" or "18". So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
