gt_text: MIRA EKONOMI
vlm_output: MIRA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRA EKONOMI" and the VLM OCR output is "MIRA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "MIRA". 

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output has "MIRA" but is missing "EKONOMI". 

Now, checking the categories: Category 1 requires all unique ground truth words to be present. Since "EKONOMI" isn't in the OCR output, that's not met. Category 2 is for at least one but not all unique words. Here, "MIRA" is present, so that's one out of two. The instructions mention ignoring case, spacing, and typos, but since the OCR output is exactly "MIRA" and the ground truth has "MIRA" as well, there's no typo here. 

The OCR output is missing one of the two unique words, so it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.
