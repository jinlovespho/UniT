gt_text: MAMBU
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MAMBU" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". The part inside the backticks is just "1", so maybe that's the actual extracted text. But I should check if the entire sentence is considered. However, the instruction says to extract the text content, so perhaps the main part is "1" since the rest is descriptive. Alternatively, maybe the entire output is considered, but the user might be focusing on the actual text that's supposed to be extracted. Let me think. The OCR output is supposed to capture the text in the image, so the part after "is:" might be the extracted text. In this case, it's "1", which is a number. 

Now, the ground truth is "MAMBU", which is a word, not a number. The extracted text from OCR is "1". Comparing these, the unique words in the ground truth are {"MAMBU"}. The OCR output's text is "1", which is a number. Since there's no overlap in words between "MAMBU" and "1", even considering case, spacing, etc., there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Here, none of the words match. So the category would be 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the OCR output might have extracted "1" as part of the text. However, "MAMBU" is a word, and "1" is a number. There's no way they can be considered the same even with typos or case changes. So no match. Therefore, category 3.
