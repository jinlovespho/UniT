gt_text: ART

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ART" and the VLM OCR output is also "ART". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ART".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we should consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "ART". The OCR output also has "ART". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But both are exactly "ART", so no issues there. Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here.

Now, looking at the categories. Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "ART" and the OCR output has "ART", that's a perfect match. So this should be category 1. There's no missing words or extra words. Even if there were, like if OCR had "art" lowercase, it would still count because of ignoring capitalization. But here, it's exactly the same. So definitely category 1.
