gt_text: Dunelm
vlm_output: Dunelm

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Dunelm" and the VLM OCR output is also "Dunelm". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "Dunelm".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word in both, order isn't an issue here. Then, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Dunelm". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Now, checking for capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are exactly the same, so no issues there. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

Since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word), the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
