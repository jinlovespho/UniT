Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "88" and the VLM OCR output is also "88". So, first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "88", that's straightforward. The extracted text is just "88".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But here, both are exactly the same: "88". 

The ground truth has one unique word, which is "88". The OCR output also has "88". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though there's only one word, it's a match. 

Looking at the categories: 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's correct, this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because there's only one word. Also, no typos or issues with spacing. So the answer should be 1.
