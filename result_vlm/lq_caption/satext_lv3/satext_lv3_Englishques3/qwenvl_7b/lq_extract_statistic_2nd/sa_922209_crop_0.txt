Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TAXI-METER" and the OCR output is "TAXIMETER". The user wants me to follow specific steps to compare them.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's "TAXIMETER". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has one word: "TAXI-METER". The OCR output has "TAXIMETER".

So, I need to check if "TAXIMETER" matches "TAXI-METER" considering the rules. Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. The ground truth has a hyphen, but the OCR output doesn't. However, the rule says to ignore punctuation. Also, the OCR output is missing the hyphen but has the same letters. The hyphen is part of the original text, but the rules say to ignore punctuation. So, "TAXI-METER" without the hyphen becomes "TAXIMETER", which is exactly what the OCR output has. Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. So even if there's a hyphen missing, since it's considered punctuation and we ignore that, the OCR output is correct.

So the unique word in the ground truth is "TAXI-METER", and the OCR output has "TAXIMETER" which matches when ignoring the hyphen and case. Therefore, all unique words match. So the category should be 1.
