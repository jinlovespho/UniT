gt_text: POLKA Gessler Magda
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```10```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "POLKA Gessler Magda" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```10```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The visible text in the image is:```10```". So the actual text here is "The visible text in the image is: 10". But the user wants me to ignore things like capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, word order doesn't matter. 

Next, the ground truth has the words "POLKA", "Gessler", and "Magda". Let's look at the OCR output. The OCR output has words like "The", "visible", "text", "in", "image", "is", "10". None of these words are similar to the ground truth words. "POLKA" is a word, but the OCR output has "The", which is different. "Gessler" and "Magda" are proper nouns, and the OCR output doesn't have any of those. The only thing in the OCR output is the number 10, which isn't a word from the ground truth. 

Considering the rules: even if there were typos, but here there's no overlap in words. The ground truth words are POLKA, Gessler, Magda. The OCR output has none of these. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't have any of the required words. So the answer should be 3.
