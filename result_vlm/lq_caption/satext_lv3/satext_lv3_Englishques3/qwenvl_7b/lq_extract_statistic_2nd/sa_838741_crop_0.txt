gt_text: INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So, the actual text extracted would be "The visible text in the image is: 1". But maybe the OCR output is just the part after the colon? Wait, the user says "Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the VLM OCR output is the entire string provided, which includes the part after the colon. So the extracted text is "1".

Wait, but looking at the OCR output again: "The visible text in the image is:```1```". The user might be using backticks to denote the OCR result. Maybe the actual extracted text is "1"? Because the part after the colon is inside backticks, which might be the OCR result. So maybe the extracted text is "1".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth is "INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE". The unique words here are "INTERNATIONAL", "CORPORATION", "SERVICE".

The OCR output's extracted text is "1". So, the words in the OCR output are just "1", which is a number, not any of the words from the ground truth. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. The OCR output is "1", which is a number, not any of the words. 

So, according to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique words are present. 2 is if at least one matches. 3 is if none match. Since none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category would be 3. 

Wait, but what about typos? The instruction says small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words. Even if there were a typo, like "internationl" instead of "international", but here there's just "1", which is unrelated. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
