gt_text: THE TO WELCOME REPUBLIC
vlm_output: WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "THE TO WELCOME REPUBLIC". The VLM OCR output is "WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is already given as "WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC". Then, I have to compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. 

Next, I should look at the unique words in the ground truth. Let's break them down. The ground truth has "THE", "TO", "WELCOME", "REPUBLIC". The OCR output has "WELCOME", "TO", "THE", "REPUBLIC". 

Comparing the sets, all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Even though "THE" is in the ground truth and appears in the OCR output, and the same with the others. The order is different, but that's okay. Also, capitalization is ignored, so "THE" and "TO" in the OCR are uppercase, but the ground truth has them in uppercase as well. Wait, actually, the ground truth is all uppercase, but the OCR output is also all uppercase. So capitalization isn't an issue here. 

No typos are present either. The words are exactly the same. So all the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output. That would mean category 1: Correct. 

I should check if there's any missing words. The ground truth has four words, and the OCR output has the same four words. So all are present. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
