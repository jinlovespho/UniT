gt_text: RMERIE JANDA RMA JANDARMA
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```Equestrian Federation of Canada```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. They want me to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific comparison rules.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The visible text in the image is:```Equestrian Federation of Canada```". So the actual extracted text here is "Equestrian Federation of Canada". I should ignore the surrounding text and just focus on the part inside the backticks, which is the OCR's recognized text.

Next, the ground truth text is "RMERIE JANDA RMA JANDARMA". Let me process this. The user mentioned that word order doesn't matter, so I need to compare the unique words from the ground truth with those in the OCR output. But first, I should normalize both texts according to the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth. The original text is "RMERIE JANDA RMA JANDARMA". Let's split it into words: "RMERIE", "JANDA", "RMA", "JANDARMA". Now, considering that capitalization doesn't matter, I can convert them all to lowercase: "rmerie", "janda", "rma", "jandarma".

Now the OCR output is "Equestrian Federation of Canada". Let's split that into words: "Equestrian", "Federation", "of", "Canada". Lowercase: "equestrian", "federation", "of", "canada".

Now, the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has four unique words: rmerie, janda, rma, jandarma. The OCR output has four words: equestrian, federation, of, canada. None of these words match any of the ground truth words. Even if there were typos, the words are completely different. For example, "jandarma" vs. "canada" – no overlap. So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth.

Therefore, according to the categories: 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since none of the words match, the category is 3.
