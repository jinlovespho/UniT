Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "214" and the VLM OCR output is also "214". The steps say to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Then compare it with the ground truth.

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter. But since both are just the number 214, there's only one "word" here. The unique words in the ground truth are just {"214"}. The OCR output has the same word. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But since both are exactly the same, those factors don't come into play here. There are no typos either. So according to category 1, which requires all unique ground truth words to appear in the OCR output, this should be a correct match. 

No issues here. The answer should be 1.
