Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GALLERY" and the VLM OCR output is also "GALLERY". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "GALLERY", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are the same word.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "GALLERY". The OCR output also has the same word. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation to worry about here.

Regarding typos, the problem states that small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos here, that's not an issue.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "GALLERY" and the ground truth also has "GALLERY", all unique words (just one here) are present. 

So, the answer should be Category 1.
