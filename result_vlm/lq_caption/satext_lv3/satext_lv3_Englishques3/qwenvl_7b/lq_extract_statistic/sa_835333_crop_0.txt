gt_text: RIKSTELEFON
vlm_output: HÄSSLERFORS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RIKSTELEFON" and the VLM OCR output is "HÄSSLERFORS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already given as "HÄSSLERFORS". Then, I compare it with the ground truth, considering the specified conditions.

The key points to consider are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "RIKSTELEFON". So the unique words in the ground truth are just that one word.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. So both texts should be compared in lowercase, without considering spaces or punctuation. But since both are single words, that might not matter here.
- Small typos still count as matches. So even if there are minor spelling differences, they are considered correct.

Now, let's process each text. The ground truth is "RIKSTELEFON". The OCR output is "HÄSSLERFORS". 

First, convert both to lowercase: "riks telefon" vs "hassel fors"? Wait, no. Wait, the ground truth is "RIKSTELEFON" which is one word. The OCR output is "HÄSSLERFORS", which is also one word. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "RIKSTELEFON". The OCR output is "HÄSSLERFORS". 

Now, checking if "HÄSSLERFORS" contains the unique ground truth word "RIKSTELEFON" in any form, considering typos. But "HÄSSLERFORS" doesn't look like "RIKSTELEFON" at all. There's no overlap in letters. Even with typos, they are completely different words. 

So according to the categories:
- Category 1: All unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. Here, the ground truth has one word, which isn't present in the OCR output. So not category 1.
- Category 2: At least one but not all. But since there's only one word, and it's not present, this is not applicable.
- Category 3: No words match, or output is unrelated. Since "HÄSSLERFORS" is a different word, unrelated to "RIKSTELEFON", this would be category 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.
