gt_text: TEATRO
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TEATRO" and the VLM OCR output is "TEATRO SOLIS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "TEATRO SOLIS", so the words are "TEATRO" and "SOLIS".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "TEATRO". The OCR output has two words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". 

Now, considering the guidelines: word order doesn't matter, so we just check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "TEATRO", which is exactly present in the OCR output. The other word in the OCR output, "SOLIS", isn't part of the ground truth, but that's okay because the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. 

The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, since "TEATRO" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, it's still a correct match. Also, the problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Capitalization and spacing are ignored, but both are the same here. 

Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "TEATRO") are present in the OCR output. So the category should be 1 — Correct.
