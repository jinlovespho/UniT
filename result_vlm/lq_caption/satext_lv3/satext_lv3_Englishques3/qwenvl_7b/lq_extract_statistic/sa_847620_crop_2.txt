gt_text: GALIONE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "T" (appears twice)- "D" (appears twice)

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GALIONE" and the VLM OCR output mentions "T" and "D" each appearing twice. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there are "T" and "D" letters. But the ground truth is the word "GALIONE". 

Now, comparing the extracted text (T and D) with the ground truth. The ground truth has the letters G, A, L, I, O, N, E. The OCR output has T and D, which are completely different letters. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique words from the ground truth to be in the OCR output. But the OCR output doesn't have any of the letters in "GALIONE". 

Category 2 is if at least one word matches, but here there's no match. So it's not partially correct. 

Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated output. Since the OCR output mentions different letters entirely, it's unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
