gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "NANTES".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "NANTES", which is a single word. The OCR output is the same. Since both are the same word, ignoring case (but they are both uppercase here), and there are no typos, the comparison should be a perfect match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and the OCR output has that same word, it's a match. So the answer should be 1.
