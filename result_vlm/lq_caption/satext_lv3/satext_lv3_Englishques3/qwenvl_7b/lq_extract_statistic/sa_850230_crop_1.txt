gt_text: XIV
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"FRANCE"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "XIV", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"FRANCE"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output seems to be a sentence that mentions "FRANCE" as the visible words and letters. So the extracted text here is "FRANCE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "XIV". The ground truth is "XIV", which is a Roman numeral for 14. The OCR output extracted text is "FRANCE", which is a French word meaning "country" in English. 

Now, looking at the categories. The unique words in the ground truth are just "XIV". The OCR output has "FRANCE". Since "XIV" and "FRANCE" are completely different words, there's no overlap. Even considering typos, case, spacing, etc., there's no match here. The OCR output didn't capture the ground truth word at all. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3

2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 92
