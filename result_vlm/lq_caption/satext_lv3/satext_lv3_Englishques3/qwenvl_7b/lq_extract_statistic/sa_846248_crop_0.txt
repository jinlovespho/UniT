gt_text: RAC
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "S" (partially obscured)- "T" (partially obscured)

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RAC" and the VLM OCR output mentions "S" and "T" as partially obscured letters. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there are "S" and "T" letters, but they're partially obscured. So the extracted text would be "S" and "T".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "RAC". The unique words in the ground truth are just "RAC" since it's a single word. Now, looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of "R", "A", or "C". The OCR only found "S" and "T", which are different letters.

The categories are based on whether the unique ground truth words are present. Since "RAC" isn't in the OCR output, and none of its letters are matched (the OCR has S and T), there's no overlap. According to the rules, if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR mentions letters, they don't align with the ground truth. Also, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, which is "RAC", and the OCR doesn't have that. So the answer should be 3.
