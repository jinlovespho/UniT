Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "88" and the VLM OCR output is also "88". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "88".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same.

The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "88". The OCR output also has "88". 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, there's no capitalization or punctuation involved. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth in terms of content and spacing.

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here since both are identical.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
