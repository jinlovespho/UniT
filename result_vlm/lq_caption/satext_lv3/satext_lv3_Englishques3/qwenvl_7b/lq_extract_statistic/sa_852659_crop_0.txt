gt_text: TECHNOPARK
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"Rustic"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "TECHNOPARK". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are: 'Rustic'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Rustic" as the visible word. So the extracted text is just "Rustic".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "TECHNOPARK". Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, there's only one word in each.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TECHNOPARK".
- Ignore capitalization, so "TECHNOPARK" vs. "technopark" would be same. But the OCR output has "Rustic", which is different.
- Typos are considered matches if they're small. But "Rustic" isn't a typo of "TECHNOPARK"; they're entirely different words.

So, the OCR output's extracted text is "Rustic", which doesn't match "TECHNOPARK" in any way. There are no overlapping words. Therefore, category 3 applies because there's no match. The output is unrelated.
