gt_text: EY
vlm_output: EY

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EY" and the VLM OCR output is also "EY". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is already "EY", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly "EY", so order isn't an issue here.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EY". The OCR output also has "EY", which is the same. 

Now, considering the other factors: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "EY" with no punctuation or spaces, this doesn't change anything. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories, Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR output has the same word, this fits Category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches exactly, so the answer should be 1.
