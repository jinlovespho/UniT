gt_text: Google

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both are exactly "Google". 

The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output also has "Google". Since they are the same, even if there were minor differences like capitalization, but here they are exactly the same. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, that's category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output has exactly the same word. So the answer should be 1.
