gt_text: Marshall
vlm_output: Marshall

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Marshall" and the VLM OCR output is also "Marshall". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Marshall".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Marshall". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. Since both are the same word, even if there were a typo, it's considered a match. But here, they are exactly the same. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a match, the answer should be 1.
