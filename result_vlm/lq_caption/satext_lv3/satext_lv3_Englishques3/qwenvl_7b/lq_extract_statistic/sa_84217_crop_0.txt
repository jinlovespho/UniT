gt_text: Phedra
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```2```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Phedra". The VLM OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```2```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "2" inside backticks. So the extracted text here is just "2".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "Phedra". The ground truth has one unique word: "Phedra". The OCR output has "2", which is a number, not a word. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "Phedra" is a word and the OCR output has "2", there's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, "2" isn't a typo of "Phedra". Also, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and empty in terms of the expected words.
