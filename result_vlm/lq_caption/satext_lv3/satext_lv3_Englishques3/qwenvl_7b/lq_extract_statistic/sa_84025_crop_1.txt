gt_text: ESCALATOR
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"10% OFF"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ESCALATOR" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"10% OFF"". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "10% OFF" as the visible words and letters. So the extracted text here is "10% OFF".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "ESCALATOR". Now, the categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

Looking at the OCR output, the words are "10% OFF". The ground truth word is "ESCALATOR". There's no overlap between "10% OFF" and "ESCALATOR". The OCR output doesn't mention "ESCALATOR" at all. 

Considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "ESCALATOR" isn't in the OCR output, there's no match. Also, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, etc., but "10% OFF" is completely different from "ESCALATOR". 

So, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth here. Even if there were typos, but in this case, there's no match at all. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
