gt_text: 山公園
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"平顶山公园"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "山公園" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"平顶山公园"". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output starts with some English text, then there's a colon, and then "平顶山公园". The English part is probably not relevant here since the ground truth is in Japanese or Chinese. Wait, the ground truth is "山公園", which is Japanese for "Mount Park" or something similar. The OCR output has "平顶山公园" which is Chinese, meaning "Pingdingshan Park". 

Now, Step 1: Extract the text content. The OCR output includes both English and Chinese. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "山公園", which is two words: "山" (mountain) and "公園" (park). But wait, in Japanese, "山公園" is a single compound word, right? But the instructions say to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the ground truth is given as a single string. Maybe the user considers "山" and "公園" as separate words? Or is it one word?

Wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, if the ground truth is "山公園", does that count as one word or two? In Japanese, it's a single compound word, but maybe the OCR output is splitting it into separate words. However, the OCR output is "平顶山公园" which is Chinese. Let me check the characters. 

"平顶山公园" translates to "Pingdingshan Park" in English. The original ground truth is "山公園", which is "Mount Park" or "Mountain Park" in Japanese. So the OCR output is in Chinese, and the ground truth is in Japanese. But the problem says to compare the text content, considering the words. But the languages are different. Wait, the user might have made a mistake here, but maybe the OCR output is supposed to be in the same language as the ground truth. However, the OCR output here is in Chinese, while the ground truth is in Japanese. That seems like a problem. But maybe the user intended that the OCR output is in the same language but with different characters. Wait, the OCR output says "平顶山公园" which is Chinese, and the ground truth is "山公園" which is Japanese. So they are different languages. But the instructions say to compare the words. However, the problem might be that the OCR output is supposed to be the same as the ground truth, but in this case, it's different. 

But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again. The ground truth text is "山公園", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"平顶山公园""

Wait, the OCR output starts with English text, then has "平顶山公园". So the actual extracted text is "平顶山公园". The ground truth is "山公園". So comparing "平顶山公园" (Chinese) to "山公園" (Japanese). Are these considered the same? Probably not. But maybe the user made a typo, and the OCR output is supposed to be in Japanese. However, the OCR output is in Chinese. 

But according to the problem's instructions, we need to compare the extracted text from the OCR output with the ground truth. So, the extracted text is "平顶山公园", which is Chinese, and the ground truth is "山公園", which is Japanese. They are different words. So none of the words match. Therefore, the category would be 3, because no words match. 

Wait, but maybe the OCR output has "平顶山公园" which includes the word "山" (mountain) and "公园" (park). The ground truth is "山公園" which is "山" and "公園" (park). The Chinese "公园" is equivalent to Japanese "公園". So maybe "山" is present in both. The OCR output has "平顶山公园" which includes "山" and "公园". The ground truth has "山" and "公園". So if we consider that "公园" and "公園" are the same word (park), then the OCR output has both "山" and "公园", which correspond to the ground truth's "山" and "公園". So the unique words in the ground truth are "山" and "公園". The OCR output has "平顶山公园", which includes "山" and "公园". So if "公园" is considered the same as "公園", then both words are present. 

But the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "山" and "公園". The OCR output's text is "平顶山公园", which includes "平顶山" and "公园". So "平顶山" is a proper noun (Pingdingshan), and "公园" is park. The ground truth has "山" (mountain) and "公園" (park). So the OCR output has "公园" which is park, matching "公園", and "山" is present in "平顶山" (Pingdingshan). But is "平顶山" considered to contain "山"? Yes, because "平顶山" is a name that includes "山" (mountain). So the OCR output includes "山" (as part of "平顶山") and "公园" (park), which corresponds to the ground truth's "山" and "公園". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "山公園", which is two words, then the OCR output has "平顶山公园" which includes "山" and "公园". So the OCR output has both words present in the ground truth. Therefore, category 1: correct. 

Wait, but the OCR output is "平顶山公园" which is a single word (a proper noun), but it contains "山" and "公园". So even though it's a longer phrase, the words "山" and "公园" are present. So according to the instructions, the OCR output must contain all unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique words are "山" and "公園". The OCR output has "山" and "公园", which are the same as "公園" (since "公园" is the Chinese equivalent). Therefore, both words are present. 

But the problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, the OCR output is in Chinese, and the ground truth is in Japanese. But the words "山" and "公園" are the same character for "山" (mountain), and "公园" vs "公園" are the same word for park, just different scripts. So maybe the system considers them as matches. 

Therefore, the OCR output contains both words from the ground truth, so category 1.
