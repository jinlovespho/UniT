vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:- "EYEL" (partially obscured)- "EYEL" (partially obscured)

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1099", and the VLM OCR output mentions "EYEL" twice, both partially obscured. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says there are visible English words and letters, specifically "EYEL" twice. So the extracted text is "EYEL" (twice).

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "1099". The ground truth is a number, but the OCR output has the word "EYEL". The unique words in the ground truth are just "1099", which is a number, not a word. The OCR output has "EYEL" which is a different word. 

The categories are based on whether the OCR output contains the unique words from the ground truth. Since "1099" is a number and not a word, and the OCR output has "EYEL" which doesn't match, there's no overlap. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth's unique word (if we consider "1099" as a word) isn't present in the OCR output, there are zero matches. 

Therefore, according to category 3, which is for when no words match or the output is unrelated, the answer should be 3.
