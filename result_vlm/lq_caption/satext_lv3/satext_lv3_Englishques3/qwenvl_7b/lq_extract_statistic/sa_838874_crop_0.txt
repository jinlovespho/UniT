Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PKL" and the VLM OCR output is also "PKL". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is straightforward since the OCR output is exactly "PKL". 

Moving to Step 2, the comparison needs to consider several factors: word order doesn't matter, we only compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "PKL". Let's break it down. The unique words here are just "PKL" since it's a single word. The OCR output is also "PKL". Comparing them, they are identical. Even if there were minor differences like capitalization (but both are uppercase here) or spacing (there's no space in either), they would still match. Since there are no typos, it's a perfect match.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, this fits Category 1. There's no partial match or no match here. So the answer should be 1.
