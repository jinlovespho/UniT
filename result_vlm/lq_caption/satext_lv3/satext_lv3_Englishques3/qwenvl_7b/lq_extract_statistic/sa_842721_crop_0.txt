gt_text: 30
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:123

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "30" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:123". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:123". So the extracted text would be "The visible text in the image is:123". Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth "30".

The comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just "30", which is a single number. The OCR output has numbers in it: "123". But the ground truth is "30", which is different from "123". 

Now, checking the categories. The first category is correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has "30" as the only unique word. The OCR output has "123" as the number. Since "30" is not present in the OCR output, even though there's a number, it's a different number. So the OCR output doesn't have the correct number. 

Next, the second category is partially correct if at least one but not all unique words match. But in this case, the ground truth has only one unique word ("30"), and the OCR output doesn't have that word. So there are zero matches. 

The third category is incorrect if no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output has "123" instead of "30", there's no match. Therefore, the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 35
2. Slightly Correct Num: 0
3. Incorrect Num: 56
