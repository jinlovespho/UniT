Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "EMPLOYEES" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```". So, the actual text content here would be the numbers "1234567890" since the rest is descriptive text. But wait, the problem says to extract the text content, which might mean the main text part. However, the OCR output might have the numbers as the extracted text. Let me check the exact wording: "The visible text in the image is:```1234567890```". So the OCR output is stating that the visible text is the numbers. Therefore, the extracted text content from the OCR is "1234567890".

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "EMPLOYEES". The unique words in the ground truth are just "EMPLOYEES" (since it's a single word). The OCR output's extracted text is "1234567890", which is a sequence of numbers. 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EMPLOYEES". The OCR output's extracted text is numbers, which are not words. So, there's no match here. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but the OCR output here is numbers, which are not words. So, there's no overlap. Even if we consider typos, but the OCR output doesn't have the word "EMPLOYEES" or any variation of it. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
