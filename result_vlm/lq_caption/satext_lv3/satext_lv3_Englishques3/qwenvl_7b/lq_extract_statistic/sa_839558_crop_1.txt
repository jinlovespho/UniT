gt_text: PLH32
vlm_output: PLH32

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLH32" and the VLM OCR output is also "PLH32". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PLH32". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. There are no typos because the OCR output is identical. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though there's only one word, it should be category 1. The categories say category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear. There's no partial match here because there's only one word and it's correct. So the answer must be 1.
