Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "1" and the VLM OCR output is also "1". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is just "1", that's straightforward.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "1". The OCR output also has "1". Since they are exactly the same, even though there's only one word, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories, Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it matches, this should be Category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. Even if there were typos, like "l" instead of "1", but in this case, it's exactly correct. So the answer should be 1.
