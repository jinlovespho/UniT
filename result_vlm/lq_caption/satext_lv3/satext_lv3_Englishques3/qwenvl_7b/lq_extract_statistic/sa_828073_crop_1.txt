gt_text: DALIAN
vlm_output: DALIAN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in different orders, it would still count. But here they are exactly the same. Also, we have to consider unique words in the ground truth. Since "DALIAN" is a single word, the set of unique words is just {"DALIAN"}.

Next, ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces are ignored, but there's no punctuation or extra spaces here. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
