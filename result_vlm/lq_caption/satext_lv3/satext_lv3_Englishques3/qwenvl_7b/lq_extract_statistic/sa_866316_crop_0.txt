Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "13" and the VLM OCR output is also "13". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "13", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "13".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But in this case, both the ground truth and the OCR output are exactly the same: "13". 

The ground truth has the unique words "13" (assuming numbers are considered words here). The OCR output has the same. Since they are identical, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, "13", and it matches exactly, this should be category 1. There's no issue with typos, spacing, or anything else. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth. So the answer is 1.
