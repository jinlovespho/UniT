gt_text: CRE
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```R```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CRE" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is: ```R```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "R" inside backticks, so the extracted text here is just "R". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "CRE". The ground truth has three letters: C, R, E. The OCR output only has "R". Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present. However, the OCR output only has one unique word, "R", while the ground truth has three unique letters. 

Wait, but the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "CRE", which are three unique characters. The OCR output has "R" as the only character. So, only one of the three unique words (R) is present. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since only one of the three is present, that would be category 2 — partially correct. Even though the OCR output is missing C and E, but it's not empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 2.
