gt_text: LAMBORGHINI
vlm_output: LAMBORGHINI

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "LAMBORGHINI" and the VLM OCR output is also "LAMBORGHINI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, the extracted text is "LAMBORGHINI".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here both are single words. The unique words in the ground truth are just "LAMBORGHINI". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There are no typos here since they're identical. 

So all unique ground truth words (just one) are present in the OCR output. That fits category 1: Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The answer should be 1.
