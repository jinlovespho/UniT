gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Bank", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are just the single word "Bank".

The comparison needs to consider unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Bank". The OCR output also has "Bank". 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are the same here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this should be Category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches perfectly. 

I don't see any reason to categorize this as partially correct or incorrect. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth when considering all the specified factors. So the answer should be 1.
