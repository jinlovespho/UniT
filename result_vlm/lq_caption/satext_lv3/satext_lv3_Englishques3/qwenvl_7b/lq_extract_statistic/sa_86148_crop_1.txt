gt_text: XCELSIOR
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "XCELSIOR" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So, the actual text extracted would be "The visible text in the image is: 1". But maybe the OCR output is just the part after the colon? Wait, the original says the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So maybe the OCR is reporting that the visible text is "1", but the way it's written is with backticks. But the user says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is a sentence that says the visible text is "1", but maybe the actual text extracted is just "1"?

Wait, the user says "Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So the extracted text would be "1", because that's the part that's in the backticks. Or is the entire sentence considered the text content? Hmm, the problem might be that the OCR output is a sentence that says the visible text is "1", but the actual extracted text is "1". But I need to check the exact instructions. The user says "the VLM OCR output: 'The visible text in the image is:```1```'". So the OCR output is the entire sentence, but the actual text that the OCR is reporting is "1". However, the step says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So perhaps the extracted text is "The visible text in the image is: 1", but maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text that's in the image, which in this case is "1". But the problem states that the ground truth text is "XCELSIOR", which is a word, and the OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```", which is a sentence that includes "1" as the text in the image. But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text that was in the image, so in this case, the OCR output is "1", but the ground truth is "XCELSIOR". 

But this is confusing. Let me re-read the problem. The ground truth text is "XCELSIOR", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So the OCR output is the text that the VLM model outputs, which is a sentence stating that the visible text in the image is "1". But the actual text in the image is "XCELSIOR", which is the ground truth. So the OCR output here is the model's answer, which is "1" as the text in the image, but the correct answer is "XCELSIOR". 

So, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that says the visible text is "1". So the extracted text would be "1". Then, step 2 is to compare that extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "XCELSIOR", which is a word. The extracted text is "1", which is a number. 

Now, the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "XCELSIOR". The OCR output's extracted text is "1", which is a number, not a word. So there's no match. Therefore, category 3: incorrect. 

But wait, the problem says "unique words in the ground truth", so "XCELSIOR" is one unique word. The OCR output's extracted text is "1", which is not a word. So no matches. Hence, category 3. 

But maybe the OCR output is considered as the entire sentence, not just the "1". Let me check again. The user says "the VLM OCR output: 'The visible text in the image is:```1```'". So the OCR output is the entire sentence, but perhaps the actual text in the image is "1", and the OCR model is reporting that. However, the ground truth is "XCELSIOR", which is the actual text in the image. So the OCR model's output is "1", which is incorrect. 

So in that case, the extracted text from the OCR output is "1", which is not a word from the ground truth. Therefore, no matches, so category 3. 

But maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text that's in the image, which is "XCELSIOR", but the OCR output is "1", which is wrong. So the answer would be category 3. 

Alternatively, if the OCR output is the entire sentence, then the extracted text would be "The visible text in the image is: 1", which includes the word "text", "image", etc., but the ground truth is "XCELSIOR". None of those words are present in the ground truth. So again, no matches. Therefore, category 3.
