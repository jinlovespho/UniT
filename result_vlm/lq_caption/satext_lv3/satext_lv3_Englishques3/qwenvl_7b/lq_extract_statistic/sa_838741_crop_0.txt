gt_text: INTERNATIONAL
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```1```". So the actual text here is "The visible text in the image is: 1". The part after the colon is "1", which is a number, but the rest is just a sentence.

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "INTERNATIONAL", which is a single word. The OCR output's text includes "1" and other words like "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, and we only check for unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "INTERNATIONAL". The OCR output's text doesn't have that word. The number "1" is not the same as "INTERNATIONAL", even if we consider typos. Also, the OCR output's words are all different from the ground truth's word. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain the correct word. Even if there were typos, "1" is not a typo of "INTERNATIONAL", so it doesn't count. So the answer should be 3.
