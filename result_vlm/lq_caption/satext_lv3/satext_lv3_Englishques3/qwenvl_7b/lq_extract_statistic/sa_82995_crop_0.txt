gt_text: AGAINST
vlm_output: 2X POWER AGAINST STAINS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AGAINST" and the VLM OCR output is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". So the words here are "2X", "POWER", "AGAINST", "STAINS".

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "AGAINST". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "AGAINST".

Now, check if "AGAINST" is present in the OCR output. Looking at the OCR words: "2X", "POWER", "AGAINST", "STAINS". Yes, "AGAINST" is there. The other words like "2X", "POWER", and "STAINS" are not part of the ground truth, but since the ground truth only has "AGAINST", the presence of that word in the OCR output is what matters.

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, capitalization is ignored, but "AGAINST" is already in uppercase in both, so that's fine. Punctuation and spacing are ignored, but there's no punctuation in the OCR output here. 

Since the OCR output includes the exact word "AGAINST" (which is the only unique word in the ground truth), this should be considered a correct match. Therefore, the category is 1.
