gt_text: SOLD
vlm_output: SOLD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SOLD" and the VLM OCR output is also "SOLD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "SOLD".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has one word: "SOLD". The OCR output is the same word. So, when comparing, since they are identical, all unique words from the ground truth (which is just "SOLD") are present in the OCR output. Even if there were typos, like "sOld" or "sold", it would still count as a match because of the note about small typos. But in this case, there's no typo at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, it's a full match. So the category should be 1.
