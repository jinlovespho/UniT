gt_text: MOMENT
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```1```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MOMENT". The VLM OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```1```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has "1" inside backticks, so the extracted text is just "1". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "MOMENT". The OCR output is the number 1. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MOMENT". The OCR output has "1", which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since "1" doesn't match "MOMENT" in any way, even considering typos or case, it's not a match. So the OCR output is unrelated or empty. Therefore, the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
