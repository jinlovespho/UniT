gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: BUT

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "BUT" and the VLM OCR output is also "BUT". 

First, I need to follow the steps provided. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "BUT", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria here are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "BUT".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly in that regard.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here because both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: All unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "BUT" which is the same as the ground truth, this condition is met.

2 — Slightly correct: At least one but not all unique words match. This doesn't apply here because all words (just one) match.

3 — Incorrect: No words match or the output is unrelated. Not applicable here.

So, the answer should be category 1. The OCR output exactly matches the ground truth when considering all the given criteria. Even if there were minor differences like case or spacing, they would be ignored, but in this case, everything is the same.
