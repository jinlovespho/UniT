gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "HOLLYWOOD", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue here. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are in all caps, so that's not a problem. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to consider here. Also, there are no typos because the OCR output matches exactly. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth, all unique words (just one) are present. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
