gt_text: PLAZA
vlm_output: MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLAZA" and the VLM OCR output is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". There are no spaces, so I should consider splitting it into possible words. But how? Since the original ground truth is "PLAZA", maybe the OCR output has words that include "PLAZA" as a substring.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "PLAZA" (since it's a single word). The OCR output might have "PLAZA" as part of a longer word. Let's look at "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR". Breaking it down, "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR" could be the words. But since there are no spaces, it's ambiguous. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only "PLAZA".

So, does "MADRIDPLAZAMAYOR" contain "PLAZA"? Yes, it has "PLAZA" as a substring. The problem says small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, the OCR output has "PLAZA" in it. Therefore, the unique word "PLAZA" from the ground truth is present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to category 1, which is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), this would be category 1. The other words in the OCR output like "MADRID" and "MAYOR" aren't part of the ground truth, but the ground truth only has "PLAZA", which is present. So the answer should be 1.
