gt_text: Victoria
vlm_output: Victoria Station

Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "Victoria" and the OCR output is "Victoria Station". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. The OCR output is "Victoria Station".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Victoria". The OCR output has two words: "Victoria" and "Station".

Now, I need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Victoria" is in both, that's a match. The other word in the OCR output, "Station", isn't part of the ground truth, but the rules say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even though there's an extra word, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1.

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. Here, both are lowercase, but even if they weren't, it wouldn't matter. There are no typos in "Victoria" in the OCR output, so that's good. The presence of "Station" is extra but doesn't affect the match since we only need to check the ground truth words.

Therefore, since all unique words from the ground truth ("Victoria") are present in the OCR output, the answer should be category 1.
