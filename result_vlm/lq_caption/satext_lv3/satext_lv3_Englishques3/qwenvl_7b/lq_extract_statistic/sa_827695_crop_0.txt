gt_text: Microsoft

Okay, let's see. The user provided a ground truth text of "Microsoft" and a VLM OCR output of "Microsoft". They want me to follow specific steps to categorize the result as 1, 2, or 3.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is exactly "Microsoft", so that's straightforward. 

Next, step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Microsoft". The OCR output also has "Microsoft". So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.

The other considerations: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Since both are exactly "Microsoft", there's no issue here. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Looking at the categories: category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since both are the same, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or missing words here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
