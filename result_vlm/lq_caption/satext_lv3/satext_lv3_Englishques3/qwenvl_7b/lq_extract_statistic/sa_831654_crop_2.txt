gt_text: TOYO
vlm_output: The visible word in the image is:4

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "TOYO" and the VLM OCR output is "The visible word in the image is:4". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible word in the image is:4". Let me note that down. Now, the ground truth is "TOYO", which is a single word.

Next, the comparison rules. The user mentioned that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "TOYO". But the OCR output has multiple words: "The", "visible", "word", "in", "the", "image", "is", "4". Wait, but "The" and "the" might be considered the same if we ignore capitalization. However, the ground truth is "TOYO", which is all caps. But the rules say to ignore capitalization, so maybe "TOYO" could be matched with "toyo" or similar.

But looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of "TOYO" or any variation of it. The OCR output says "the visible word in the image is:4". The number 4 might be a typo for "TOYO" if the OCR misread the letters. For example, maybe the image had the letters T-O-Y-O, but the OCR output misread it as "4" instead of "TOYO". However, the rules state that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have the word "TOYO" at all. It's just a number 4. 

Wait, the OCR output says "is:4". The colon might be a typo or a separator. But even if we consider "4" as a typo for "TOYO", that's a stretch. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "TOYO", and the OCR output doesn't have that word, even with typos, maybe it's not a match. But the rules say small typos count. However, "4" is a number, not a letter. Unless the OCR misread the letters as a number. But the user's instruction says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, "4" isn't a typo for "TOYO" in terms of letters. For example, if the OCR had "TOYO" but mistyped as "TOY4", that would be a small typo. But here, the OCR output doesn't have any letters that could be considered a typo for "TOYO". It just has the number 4. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth's unique word is "TOYO", which isn't present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The OCR output says "the visible word in the image is:4". The word "word" is present, but that's not part of the ground truth. The ground truth is "TOYO", which is a specific word. Since the OCR output didn't capture that word, even with typos, it's not matching. Therefore, the answer would be category 3.
