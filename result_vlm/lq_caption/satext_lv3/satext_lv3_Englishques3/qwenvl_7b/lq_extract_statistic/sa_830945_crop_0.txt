gt_text: HYBRID4
vlm_output: HYBRID4

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HYBRID4" and the VLM OCR output is also "HYBRID4". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to the comparison step. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is a single word: "HYBRID4". So the unique words in the ground truth are just one word. The OCR output is the same word. 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There's no punctuation here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But since there are no typos, that's not an issue here.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has that same word. Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 1: Correct. Because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, considering the allowed variations. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the one word matches exactly. Even if there were a typo, like "HYBRID4" vs "HYBRID4" (but they are the same here), it's still considered a match. So the answer should be 1.
