gt_text: mossos
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is "mossos d'esquadra".

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "mossos" and the OCR output is "mossos d'esquadra". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR says "The visible text in the image is 'mossos d'esquadra'." So the actual text extracted here is "mossos d'esquadra".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "mossos". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore the order. The ground truth has one unique word: "mossos". The OCR output has two words: "mossos" and "d'esquadra".

Next, check if all unique ground truth words are present. The ground truth has "mossos", which is exactly in the OCR output. The other word in OCR is "d'esquadra", which isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we only need to check the ground truth words. Since "mossos" is present, even though there's an extra word, the category would be 1 because all unique ground truth words are there. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring extra/missing spaces and typos. There are no typos here. The capitalization is all lowercase, which is consistent. So even though the OCR has more text, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's correct. 

So the answer should be category 1.
