gt_text: CHINA
vlm_output: The Visible English Words and Letters in the Image are:- "SUNRISE"- "SUNSET"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CHINA". The VLM OCR output says "The Visible English Words and Letters in the Image are:- "SUNRISE"- "SUNSET"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "SUNRISE" and "SUNSET" as the visible words. So the extracted text would be those two words.

Now, the ground truth is "CHINA". The unique words in the ground truth are just "CHINA" since it's a single word. The OCR output has "SUNRISE" and "SUNSET". Comparing these, neither of those words are related to "CHINA". There's no overlap in the words. Even if we consider typos or case, "CHINA" isn't present. The OCR output didn't mention any words that match the ground truth. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
