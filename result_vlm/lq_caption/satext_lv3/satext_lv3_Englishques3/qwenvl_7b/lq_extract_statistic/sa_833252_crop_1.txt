gt_text: easyJet
vlm_output: easyJet

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "easyJet", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet". The OCR output also has "easyJet". 

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are the same in this case. There's no punctuation or spaces to worry about. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here because they are exactly the same.

So, the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1: Correct. Because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, considering the given factors. There's no missing words or mismatches. So the answer is 1.
