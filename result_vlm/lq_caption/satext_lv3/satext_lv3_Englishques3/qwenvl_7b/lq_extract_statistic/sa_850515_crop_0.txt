gt_text: APA
vlm_output: The visible text in the image is:```10```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "APA", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible text in the image is:```10```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The visible text in the image is:```10```". So the actual text here is "The visible text in the image is: 10". Wait, the backticks might be part of the OCR output, but maybe they're just formatting. But the user probably wants the actual text content, so maybe the numbers 10 are the main part here. But the original ground truth is "APA", which is three letters. 

Now, step two is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is "APA" which is three letters. The OCR output has "10" as the main text. 

Wait, the ground truth is "APA", which is a set of three letters. The OCR output's extracted text is "10". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "APA" (since it's one word). The OCR output's extracted text is "The visible text in the image is: 10". The unique words here would be "The", "visible", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "10". But the ground truth is "APA". 

So comparing the unique words from the ground truth (APA) with the OCR output's unique words. The OCR output doesn't have "APA" in any form. The OCR output has "10", which is a number, not related to "APA". So there's no match. 

But wait, maybe the OCR output's text is "10" and the ground truth is "APA". Since there's no overlap in the words, even considering case, typos, etc., there's nothing. So according to the categories, category 3 is when no words match or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. The OCR output here is "10", which is unrelated to "APA". So the answer should be category 3.
