Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARUNA". The VLM OCR output says there's a cityscape with a river, and no English words or letters visible.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "cityscape", "river", "no clear English words or letters". But the ground truth is "ARUNA", which is a name, probably a person's name. 

Now, comparing the extracted text from OCR with the ground truth. The OCR output says there are no English words or letters visible. But the ground truth is "ARUNA", which is a word. However, the OCR didn't detect any words, so it's not mentioning "ARUNA" at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match (ignoring order, case, etc.), 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none. Since the OCR output says there are no words, it's not matching any of the ground truth words. So the answer should be category 3.
