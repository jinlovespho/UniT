gt_text: POLIZEI
vlm_output: POLIZEI

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "POLIZEI" and the VLM OCR output is also "POLIZEI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in a different order, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "POLIZEI". The OCR output also has "POLIZEI". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's not an issue. There are no punctuation marks or extra spaces to consider here. The text is exactly the same. Small typos would still count as matches, but there are no typos in this case.

Since all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
