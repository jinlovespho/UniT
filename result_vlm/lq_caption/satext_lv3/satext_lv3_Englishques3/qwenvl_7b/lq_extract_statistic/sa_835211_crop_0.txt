gt_text: SWITCH
vlm_output: NINTENDO SWITCH

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "SWITCH" and the OCR output is "NINTENDO SWITCH". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward; it's "NINTENDO SWITCH".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SWITCH". The OCR output has "NINTENDO" and "SWITCH". 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. The unique words in the ground truth are just "SWITCH". The OCR output has "SWITCH" as well. 

Even though there's an extra word "NINTENDO" in the OCR output, the key is that all unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "SWITCH" is there, that's a match. The other words in the OCR output don't affect this because the ground truth only has "SWITCH". 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and typos. Here, "SWITCH" is in the OCR output, same as the ground truth, so no issues there. 

So, the category should be 1 because all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.
