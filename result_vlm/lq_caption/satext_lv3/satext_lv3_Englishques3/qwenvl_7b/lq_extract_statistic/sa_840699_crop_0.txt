gt_text: in
vlm_output: in

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in" and the VLM OCR output is also "in". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "in", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are just one word, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "in", and the OCR output also has "in". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are lowercase and have no punctuation or spaces. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since they're exactly the same.

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, all unique words (which is just "in") are present. So that's category 1. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
