gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: CROWN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CROWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "CROWN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "CROWN".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "CROWN". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the criteria: ignoring case, spacing, punctuation. Both are uppercase, same spacing. No typos mentioned here. So the OCR output matches exactly. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word, and it's present, that's a Category 1. There's no partial match here because all words match. So the answer should be 1.
