gt_text: LV
vlm_output: LV

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "LV" and the VLM OCR output is also "LV". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "LV", that's straightforward.

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are just two letters. The unique words in the ground truth are "LV" (assuming it's considered a single word here). The OCR output is exactly the same. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, there's no punctuation or spaces. The OCR output matches exactly. Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So, the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (which is just "LV") are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words, partial matches, or errors. The answer should be 1.
