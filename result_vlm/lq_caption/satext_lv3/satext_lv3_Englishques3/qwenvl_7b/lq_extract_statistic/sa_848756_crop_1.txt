gt_text: GRUNO
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"KFC"

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "GRUNO". The VLM OCR output says "The visible English words and letters in the image are: KFC".

First, step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KFC" as the visible words. So the extracted text is "KFC".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "GRUNO". Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "GRUNO". The OCR output has "KFC". 

Now, checking the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to see if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "GRUNO" isn't present in "KFC". There's no overlap. Also, considering typos, but "KFC" and "GRUNO" are completely different words. No letters match in a way that would count as a typo. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, it falls under category 3: Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth.
