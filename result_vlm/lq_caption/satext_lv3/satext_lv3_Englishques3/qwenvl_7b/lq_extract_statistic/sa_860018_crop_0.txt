gt_text: HOUSE
vlm_output: The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOUSE", and the VLM OCR output is "The visible English words and letters in the image are:"THE""

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "THE" as the visible words. So the extracted text is "THE".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "HOUSE". The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOUSE" since it's a single word. Now, the OCR output has "THE". 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth word is "HOUSE", and the OCR output has "THE". These are different words. 

Even if we consider typos, "THE" isn't a typo of "HOUSE". They are distinct words. Also, capitalization isn't an issue here because both are uppercase, but the main point is the actual words. Since "THE" doesn't match "HOUSE", there are no matching words. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output didn't capture the correct word, so it's incorrect.
