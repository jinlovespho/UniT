gt_text: RANCH THE HOUSE
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RANCH THE HOUSE". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```". So the actual text here is "The OCR text in the image is: 10". But maybe the part inside the code block is just "10"? Wait, the user wrote "``` 10 ```", which might be indicating that the OCR output is the number 10, possibly within a code block. But the exact text from the OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```". So the extracted text would be that entire string.

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "RANCH", "THE", "HOUSE". The OCR output has words like "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "image", "is", "10". 

The instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are "RANCH", "THE", "HOUSE". Now, check if any of these words appear in the OCR output. 

Looking at the OCR output: "The" is present (which is "THE" in the ground truth, ignoring case). But "RANCH" and "HOUSE" are not present. So the OCR output has "The" which matches "THE" (case-insensitive), but the other two words are missing. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in OCR output. 
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all. 
3 — Incorrect: none or unrelated. 

In this case, only "THE" is present (case-insensitive match). The other words "RANCH" and "HOUSE" are not in the OCR output. So it's partially correct. Therefore, the category should be 2.

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 226
2. Slightly Correct Num: 103
3. Incorrect Num: 557
