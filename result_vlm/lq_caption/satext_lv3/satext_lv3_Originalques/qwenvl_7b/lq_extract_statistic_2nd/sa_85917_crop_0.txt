gt_text: nike
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "nike".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "nike". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'nike'." 

First step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "nike". So the extracted text would be "nike".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is just "nike". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. Unique words in ground truth are just "nike". The OCR output has "nike" as well. Ignoring case, but both are lowercase. No typos, so it's a perfect match. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. There's no other words involved, so no partial matches. Definitely not category 3. So the answer should be 1.
