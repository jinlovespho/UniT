gt_text: mL 320
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "120mL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "mL 320" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads "120mL"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "120mL". So the extracted text is "120mL".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "mL 320". The unique words in the ground truth are "mL" and "320". 

Looking at the OCR output, "120mL" has "mL" but the number is 120 instead of 320. The problem says that small typos still count as matches. Wait, but here the number is different. The OCR has 120 vs the ground truth 320. Is that considered a typo? The instruction says "small typos still count as matches", but changing 320 to 120 is a larger difference. Hmm. Wait, maybe the OCR output has "120mL" which includes "mL" but the number is wrong. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "mL" and "320". The OCR output has "120mL" which includes "mL" but the number is 120. So "mL" is present, but "320" is not. So only one of the two unique words from the ground truth is present. 

According to the categories: if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer should be 2. But wait, the instruction says "small typos still count as matches". Maybe the OCR output has "120mL" where the "120" is a typo for "320"? But the user says small typos count. However, changing 320 to 120 is a significant difference. Maybe the OCR made a mistake in the number. But according to the problem's rules, we compare based on the set of unique words. The OCR output has "120mL", which includes "mL" but not "320". So only "mL" is present. Therefore, one of the two words matches. Hence, category 2.
