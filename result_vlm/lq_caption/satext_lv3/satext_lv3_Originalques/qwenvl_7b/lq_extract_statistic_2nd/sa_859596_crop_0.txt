gt_text: ZK OXF
vlm_output: The text in the image is "Air New Zealand".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "ZK OXF" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is 'Air New Zealand'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "Air New Zealand." So the extracted text is "Air New Zealand." 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "ZK" and "OXF". Wait, but "ZK" and "OXF" might be abbreviations. Let me think. "ZK" could be a flight code or something, and "OXF" might be Oxford. But the OCR output is "Air New Zealand." 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, only the set of unique words from the ground truth. So the ground truth words are "ZK" and "OXF". The OCR output has "Air", "New", "Zealand". None of these words match "ZK" or "OXF". 

But wait, maybe there's a typo or abbreviation? For example, "ZK" might be part of a longer name, but the OCR output doesn't have any of those words. Even if I consider case, "ZK" and "OXF" are uppercase, but the OCR output is in lowercase except for proper nouns like "Air New Zealand". However, the OCR output's words don't include "ZK" or "OXF". 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "ZK" and "OXF". The OCR output has "Air", "New", "Zealand". None of these match. Therefore, no words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
