gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD BLVD

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD". So the extracted text is "HOLLYWOOD BLVD".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output includes "HOLLYWOOD" as the first part, so that's a match. Then there's "BLVD" which is an abbreviation for Boulevard, but the ground truth doesn't have that. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output has two words: "HOLLYWOOD" and "BLVD". 

Now, checking if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "HOLLYWOOD" is present, and there's only one unique word in the ground truth, that means all unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output. 

The other factors mentioned are ignoring word order, case, spacing, and typos. Here, the OCR output has an extra word "BLVD" which isn't in the ground truth, but since the ground truth only has "HOLLYWOOD", and that's present, the category should be 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So even if the OCR has extra words, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. The presence of extra words doesn't affect it as long as all required words are there. 

So the answer should be 1.
