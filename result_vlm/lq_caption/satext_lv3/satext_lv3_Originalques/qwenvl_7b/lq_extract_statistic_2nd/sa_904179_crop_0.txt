gt_text: STUDENT CENTER
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "STUDENT CENTER".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth is "STUDENT CENTER". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'STUDENT CENTER'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "STUDENT CENTER", which is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if they were in reverse, it would still count. But here, they are the same. Also, we should ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase, so that's fine. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: since all unique words in the ground truth (which are "STUDENT" and "CENTER") are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1. There's no typo mentioned, and everything matches perfectly. So the answer should be 1.
