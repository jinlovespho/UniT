gt_text: Bank
vlm_output: Bank

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Bank" and the VLM OCR output is also "Bank". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is just "Bank".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't matter. But here, both are the same word. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Bank". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But both are exactly the same in this case. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. 

So the unique words from the ground truth ("Bank") are all present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and all required words are there. The other categories don't apply here because there's a full match.
