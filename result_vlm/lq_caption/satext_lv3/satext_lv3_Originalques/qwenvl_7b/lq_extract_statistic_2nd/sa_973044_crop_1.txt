gt_text: SHAKERS
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SHAKERS".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "SHAKERS". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'SHAKERS'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "SHAKERS" in quotes. So the extracted text would be "SHAKERS".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "SHAKERS". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHAKERS". The OCR output's extracted text also has "SHAKERS". 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces are ignored. There are no typos here. So the OCR output matches exactly. 

Therefore, category 1 is correct because all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output.
