gt_text: Investors For 39
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "100% RECYCLED".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Investors For 39" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads "100% RECYCLED"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads "100% RECYCLED"." So the actual extracted text here is "100% RECYCLED".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "Investors", "For", and "39". The OCR output has "100%", "RECYCLED". 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "Investors", "For", "39". The OCR output has "100%", "RECYCLED". None of these words are present in the ground truth. Even if I ignore case, "recycled" isn't in the ground truth. The numbers "39" vs "100%" don't match. The words "Investors" and "For" are completely missing. 

So according to the criteria, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 3. The answer is 3.
