gt_text: FRESH MANGO
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is: '10'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FRESH MANGO" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "10". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "FRESH" and "MANGO". 

Now, the OCR output is "10", which is a number. The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but also note that small typos still count. However, "10" isn't even close to either "FRESH" or "MANGO". There's no overlap in words here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated and doesn't have any matching words. Even if there were typos, like if it was "fresh" or "mango" with some errors, but here it's just numbers. So definitely category 3.
