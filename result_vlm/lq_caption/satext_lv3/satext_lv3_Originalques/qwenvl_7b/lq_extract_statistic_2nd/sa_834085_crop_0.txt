gt_text: 1941 1945 1945
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads:  ``` 1941 1945 ```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1941 1945 1945". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: ``` 1941 1945 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has some surrounding text, but the actual numbers are "1941 1945" inside the code block. So the extracted text would be "1941 1945".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has "1941", "1945", and "1945" again. But since we're considering unique words, the ground truth's unique words are just "1941" and "1945". 

The OCR output has "1941" and "1945", which are both present in the ground truth. Even though the ground truth has two instances of "1945", the unique set is still just those two numbers. The OCR output has both of those numbers, so all unique ground truth words are present. 

Also, the instructions say that word order doesn't matter, capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces are ignored. The OCR output has the numbers separated by a space, which matches the ground truth's spacing. There are no typos here either. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
