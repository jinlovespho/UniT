gt_text: PRESIDE DE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "THEATRE"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PRESIDE DE". The VLM OCR output says "THEATRE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "THEATRE". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, but small typos still count.

So the ground truth has two words: "PRESIDE" and "DE". The OCR output is "THEATRE", which is one word. Let me check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at "PRESIDE" and "DE" versus "THEATRE". "THEATRE" doesn't have "PRESIDE" or "DE" as substrings. Even if I ignore case, "theatre" vs "preside" or "de" – no matches. There's no overlap in the words. So the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
