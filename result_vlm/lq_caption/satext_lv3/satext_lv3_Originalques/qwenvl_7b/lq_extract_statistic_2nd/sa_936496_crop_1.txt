gt_text: 18
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "100%".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "18" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: "100%"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads: "100%"." So the actual text here is "100%". 

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "18". The unique words in the ground truth are just "18". The OCR output has "100%", which is a different number. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has "18", but the OCR has "100%". 

Are there any matches? Well, "18" isn't in the OCR output. The OCR has "100%", which is a different number. So there's no match for the unique word "18". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated. Since there are no matches, it should be category 3. 

Wait, but maybe I should check for typos. The ground truth is "18" and the OCR has "100%". Even if there were a typo, like "100" vs "18", but the problem says small typos count as matches. However, "100%" is not a typo of "18", it's a different number. So no match. 

Therefore, the answer is category 3.
