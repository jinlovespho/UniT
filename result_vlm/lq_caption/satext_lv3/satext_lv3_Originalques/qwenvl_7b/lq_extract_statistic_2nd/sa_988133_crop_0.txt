gt_text: UIT
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "UIT".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "UIT" and a VLM OCR output which is "The text in the image reads 'UIT'." I need to determine the category based on the given criteria.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the text "UIT" within quotes. So the extracted text would be "The text in the image reads 'UIT'." But I think the main thing here is to focus on the actual text content that's being recognized, which is "UIT" as per the OCR output.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "UIT", which is three letters. The OCR output's text includes "UIT" exactly as is. Now, the comparison rules state that word order doesn't matter, but we should consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. However, the ground truth here is a single word "UIT", so the unique words are just "UIT".

The comparison needs to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "UIT" in quotes, but the quotes are punctuation and should be ignored. The OCR output's text is "UIT" exactly, which matches the ground truth. Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a direct match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "UIT" and the OCR output includes "UIT", this should be a Category 1. There's no mention of any other words, so no partial matches. The OCR output isn't empty or unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
