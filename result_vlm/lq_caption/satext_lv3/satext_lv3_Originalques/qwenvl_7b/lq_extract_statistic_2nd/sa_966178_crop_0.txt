gt_text: STRASBOURG DE AI
vlm_output: The image appears to be blurred, making it difficult to read the text. However, if we can make an educated guess based on the visible shapes and patterns, it seems like the text might be "THE". If you have any additional context or a clearer version of the image, please provide it so I can assist you better.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STRASBOURG DE AI". The VLM OCR output says the image is blurred, but they guess the text might be "THE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text they provided is "THE" as their guess. 

Now, comparing that with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: STRASBOURG, DE, AI. The OCR output's guess is "THE". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, check if any of the OCR's words match any of the ground truth words, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. 

Looking at "THE" versus the ground truth words. Let's check each word:

- STRASBOURG: Doesn't match "THE".
- DE: Doesn't match "THE".
- AI: Doesn't match "THE".

So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. The OCR output's guess is "THE", which isn't part of the ground truth. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is largely wrong here since they guessed "THE" when the actual words are different. Even if there was a typo, but here there's no overlap. So the answer should be 3.
