gt_text: N3 11 29
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Wizz Air".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "N3 11 29" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Wizz Air'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "Wizz Air" is in the image. The ground truth has "N3 11 29". Now, comparing these.

The categories are based on unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth words are "N3", "11", "29". The OCR output has "Wizz", "Air". None of these words match the ground truth words. Even if I consider typos or different forms, "Wizz Air" doesn't relate to "N3", "11", or "29". The OCR output is completely different. So, no words match. That would be category 3, which is incorrect. There's no overlap in the words, so it's not even partially correct. So the answer should be 3.
