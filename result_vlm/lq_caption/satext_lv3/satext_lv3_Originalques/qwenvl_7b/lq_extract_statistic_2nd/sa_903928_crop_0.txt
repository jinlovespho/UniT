gt_text: STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` BENJAMIN HOLCER STOLARZ ```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on comparing the OCR output with the ground truth text. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The text in the image reads:  ``` BENJAMIN HOLCER STOLARZ ```". So the actual extracted text here is "BENJAMIN HOLCER STOLARZ". I should ignore the surrounding text and focus on the part inside the backticks. That gives me the OCR text as "BENJAMIN HOLCER STOLARZ".

Next, the ground truth is "STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, considering that word order doesn't matter, and ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. 

Let's break down the ground truth words. The unique words here are "STOLARZ", "BENJAMIN", and "HOLCER". Now, looking at the OCR output, the words are "BENJAMIN", "HOLCER", and "STOLARZ". The order is different, but the words themselves are the same. There's no difference in the words; all three are present. Also, capitalization is the same in both cases (all caps in the OCR, but the ground truth is also all caps except maybe the user's input here, but the problem says to ignore capitalization). Wait, the ground truth is written as "STOLARZ BENJAMIN HOLCER" which is all caps, and the OCR output is "BENJAMIN HOLCER STOLARZ" also all caps. So the capitalization is the same. 

No typos are present here. All words are present, just in a different order. Since the problem states that word order doesn't matter, and all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, this should be category 1. 

I should check if there's any missing words or extra words. The ground truth has three words, and the OCR output also has three words. All are present. No typos. So the answer should be 1.
