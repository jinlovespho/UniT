gt_text: BRÜCKE 10
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "10"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "BRÜCKE 10". The VLM OCR output says "The OCR text in the image reads: '10'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the text reads "10". So the extracted text is just "10".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "BRÜCKE" and "10". The OCR output only has "10". 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "BRÜCKE" and "10". The OCR output has "10" but not "BRÜCKE". 

Even though the OCR missed "BRÜCKE", it did capture "10". The category definitions say that if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since "10" is present, but "BRÜCKE" is missing, that's a partial match. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output is missing a word, but not all. So the answer should be category 2.
