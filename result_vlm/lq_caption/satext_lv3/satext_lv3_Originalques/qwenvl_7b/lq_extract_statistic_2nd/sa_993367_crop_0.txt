gt_text: UNO
vlm_output: UNO

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNO" and the VLM OCR output is also "UNO". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "UNO".

Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they're the same. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "UNO". The OCR output has the same word. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here since they're identical.

Now, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has "UNO" which matches the ground truth's "UNO", all unique words (just one) are present. So this should be category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. Even if there were typos, like "Uno" with lowercase 'o', it would still count as a match due to the typo rule. But in this case, it's exact. So the answer should be 1.
