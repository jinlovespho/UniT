gt_text: TEATRO SOLIS
vlm_output: TEATRO SOLIS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "TEATRO SOLIS" and the VLM OCR output is also "TEATRO SOLIS". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, comparing them based on the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, they are the same. Also, we need to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "TEATRO" and "SOLIS". The OCR output has the same two words. 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, but since we ignore case, that's not an issue here. There are no punctuation marks or extra spaces. The OCR output is exactly matching the ground truth in terms of words and their order, but even if there were typos, the instructions say small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, there are no typos. 

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same, so it's a full match.
