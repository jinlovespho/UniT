gt_text: MAXI ZOO
vlm_output: MAXI ZOO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAXI ZOO" and the VLM OCR output is also "MAXI ZOO". The task is to compare them based on certain criteria.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's exactly the same as the ground truth. Then, comparing them with the given conditions.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even if the words were in a different order, like "ZOO MAXI", it would still be considered correct. But in this case, the order is the same.

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "MAXI" and "ZOO". The OCR output has the same two words. So all unique words are present.

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here, so that's not an issue. Punctuation and spaces are also ignored. There are no extra or missing spaces here, so that's fine.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So according to the categories, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it should be category 1: Correct.
