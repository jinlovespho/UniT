gt_text: AirAsia Asia
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "AirAsia".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "AirAsia Asia". The OCR output from the VLM is "The text in the image reads 'AirAsia'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main text here is "AirAsia" since the rest is just descriptive text. The user mentioned to ignore extra/missing spaces and punctuation, so I should focus on the actual words. 

The ground truth has two unique words: "AirAsia" and "Asia". Now, looking at the OCR output, the extracted text is "AirAsia". So, "AirAsia" is present, which matches one of the ground truth words. The other word in the ground truth is "Asia", which isn't in the OCR output. 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we compare based on the set of unique words. Even if the OCR missed "Asia", but got "AirAsia", that's one match. Since the ground truth has two unique words and the OCR has one, that's partially correct. 

But wait, the OCR output has "AirAsia" which is exactly the same as the first part of the ground truth. However, the second word "Asia" is missing. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer should be 2.
