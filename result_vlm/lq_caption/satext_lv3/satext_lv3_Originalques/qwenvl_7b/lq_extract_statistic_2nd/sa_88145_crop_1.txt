gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "HSBC".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'HSBC'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "HSBC" within quotes. So the extracted text would be "HSBC" because that's the actual text mentioned. 

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "HSBC", which is exactly the same as what's in the OCR output. The instructions say to consider word order as not important, but since there's only one word here, order doesn't matter. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "HSBC". The OCR output also has "HSBC" as the only word. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. No punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. There are no typos because the OCR output exactly matches. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
