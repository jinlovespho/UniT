gt_text: CODE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "100".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CODE" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads '100'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the image reads "100". So the extracted text here is "100".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "CODE". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "CODE". The OCR output's extracted text is "100", which is a number. Now, the question is whether "100" matches "CODE" under these rules. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "CODE" as the only word. The OCR output has "100" as the only word. Are they considered a match? The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but "CODE" and "100" are entirely different. There's no overlap in letters or numbers. Also, the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, it's category 3 (Incorrect). But wait, the OCR output is "100" and the ground truth is "CODE". The OCR didn't find any of the words in the ground truth. So that's category 3. 

But maybe I'm missing something. The OCR output is about the image reading "100", but the ground truth is "CODE". So the OCR didn't recognize the text as "CODE" but instead as "100". Since there's no match in the words, even considering typos, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
