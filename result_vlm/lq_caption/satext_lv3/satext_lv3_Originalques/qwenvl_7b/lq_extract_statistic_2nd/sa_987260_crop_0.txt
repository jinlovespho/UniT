gt_text: QANTAS PLANES Disney's
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "QANTAS".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "QANTAS PLANES Disney's". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads "QANTAS"."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads "QANTAS"." So the actual extracted text here is "QANTAS".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: QANTAS, PLANES, Disney's. But the OCR only found QANTAS. The other words, PLANES and Disney's, aren't present in the OCR output.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, and compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing. But here, the OCR output only has one word, QANTAS, which matches one of the three unique words in the ground truth. So that's at least one match, but not all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR has one match (QANTAS) but misses PLANES and Disney's, it should be category 2. Even though the OCR output is a bit more than just the word, like "The text in the image reads...", the extracted text is just "QANTAS". So it's partially correct. So the answer should be 2.
