gt_text: LOVE
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is: '10'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "LOVE" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The OCR text in the image is: '10'". So the actual extracted text here is "10".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "LOVE". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "LOVE".

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But the OCR output is "10", which is numbers. The ground truth is "LOVE", which is letters. 

The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but here it's not a typo—it's completely different characters. The OCR output is numbers, and the ground truth is letters. So there's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (but here "LOVE" isn't in "10"), 2 if at least one matches (but there's no match here), and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since "10" doesn't contain "LOVE" or any of its letters as words, it's category 3.
