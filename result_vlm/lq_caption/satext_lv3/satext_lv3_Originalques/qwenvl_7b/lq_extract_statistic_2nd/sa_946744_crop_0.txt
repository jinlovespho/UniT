gt_text: km/h
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "0 km/h".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "km/h". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads "0 km/h"." 

First step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "0 km/h". So the extracted text here would be "0 km/h".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "km/h". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the words "km/h". The OCR output has "0 km/h". The unique word in the ground truth is "km/h". In the OCR output, "km/h" is present. The "0" is an extra number, but since the ground truth doesn't have that, but the question says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we check if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. The ground truth has "km/h", which is present in the OCR output. The "0" is extra, but that's allowed because we're only checking if the ground truth words are present, not the other way around. 

So even though there's an extra "0", the key word "km/h" is there. According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. So the answer should be 1.
