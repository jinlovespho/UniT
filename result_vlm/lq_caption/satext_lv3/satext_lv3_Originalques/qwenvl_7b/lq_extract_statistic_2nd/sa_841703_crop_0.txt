gt_text: CENTRAL PARK
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "OLYMPIC PARK".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CENTRAL PARK" and the VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'OLYMPIC PARK'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "OLYMPIC PARK" as the text in the image. So the extracted text is "OLYMPIC PARK".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "CENTRAL PARK". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two unique words: "CENTRAL" and "PARK". The OCR output has "OLYMPIC" and "PARK". 

Looking at the words: "PARK" is present in both. "CENTRAL" vs. "OLYMPIC" – these are different. So only one of the two unique ground truth words is present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, category 2 is "Slightly correct (partially correct): at least one but not all unique words match." Since only "PARK" matches, and "CENTRAL" doesn't, it's partially correct. So the answer should be category 2.
