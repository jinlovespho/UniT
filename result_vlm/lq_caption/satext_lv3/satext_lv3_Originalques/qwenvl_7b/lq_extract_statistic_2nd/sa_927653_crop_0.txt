gt_text: FABBRI PIAZZETTA
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '10'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "FABBRI PIAZZETTA". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '10'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says the text is '10'. So the extracted text is just the number 10.

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: FABBRI and PIAZZETTA. The OCR output has '10', which is a number, not the words. 

The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the ground truth words are FABBRI and PIAZZETTA. The OCR output has '10', which is neither of those words. 

Also, the rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but here the OCR output is completely different. There's no match in words. The OCR output is a number, not the names. 

So according to the categories: if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. Even if we consider case, spacing, etc., the words are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
