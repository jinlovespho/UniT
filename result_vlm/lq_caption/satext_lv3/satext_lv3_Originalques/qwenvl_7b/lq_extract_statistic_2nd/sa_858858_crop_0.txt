gt_text: DOUBLETREE HILTON
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "100%".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DOUBLETREE HILTON", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: "100%"." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says, "The text in the image reads: '100%'." So the actual extracted text here is "100%". 

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "DOUBLETREE" and "HILTON". The OCR output has "100%", which is a number with a percentage sign. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output doesn't have either "DOUBLETREE" or "HILTON". The only word here is "100%", which is a number, not related to the hotel names. 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces, but even if we consider "100%" as words, they don't match the ground truth words. There's no overlap in the unique words. 

Since none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't contain any of the required words.
