vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "СТАНЦИЯ ПОДЪЕЗД К ПАРКУ"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "TECHNOGYM TECHNOGYM TECHNOGYM". So the unique word here is just "TECHNOGYM", repeated three times. Now, the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  "СТАНЦИЯ ПОДЪЕЗД К ПАРКУ"".

First step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "СТАНЦИЯ ПОДЪЕЗД К ПАРКУ", which is in Cyrillic. Translating that, "СТАНЦИЯ" is "station", "ПОДЪЕЗД" is "approach" or "access", "К" is "to", and "ПАРКУ" is "park". So the text is "station access to park" or something like that.

Now, comparing this to the ground truth. The ground truth is all "TECHNOGYM" words. The OCR output has none of those words. The words in the OCR are completely different, in another language. Even if we ignore case, capitalization, etc., there's no overlap. The unique words in ground truth are "TECHNOGYM", which isn't present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output has words like "СТАНЦИЯ", which are not in the ground truth. So there's zero matches. Therefore, it's category 3: Incorrect.
