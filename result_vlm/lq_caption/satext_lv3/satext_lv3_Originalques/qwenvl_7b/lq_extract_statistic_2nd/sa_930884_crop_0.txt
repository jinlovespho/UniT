gt_text: AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "ETIHAD AIRWAYS PARTNER."

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'ETIHAD AIRWAYS PARTNER.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says the text is "ETIHAD AIRWAYS PARTNER." So the actual words here are ETIHAD, AIRWAYS, PARTNER. 

Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is "AIRWAYS PARTNER ETIHAD." Let's break down the words. The ground truth has three words: AIRWAYS, PARTNER, ETIHAD. The OCR output has the same three words but in a different order. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is different, the presence of all three words is what's important. Also, we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has the words in uppercase, same as the ground truth, so that's fine. There's a period at the end of the OCR output, but we can ignore punctuation. 

Additionally, small typos still count as matches. In this case, there are no typos. All the words are exactly as in the ground truth, just reordered. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct.
