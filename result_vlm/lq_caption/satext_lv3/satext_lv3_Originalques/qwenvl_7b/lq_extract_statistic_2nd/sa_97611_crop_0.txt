gt_text: NE BHARATMALA ROAD TO 3 PROSPERITY
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  NE 3 BRAZILIA

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NE BHARATMALA ROAD TO 3 PROSPERITY" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  NE 3 BRAZILIA". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads: NE 3 BRAZILIA". So the actual extracted text here is "NE 3 BRAZILIA". I should ignore the part that says "The text in the image reads:" because the user probably wants just the OCR'd text. So the relevant part is "NE 3 BRAZILIA".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: NE, BHARATMALA, ROAD, TO, 3, PROSPERITY. Let me list them out as a set: {NE, BHARATMALA, ROAD, TO, 3, PROSPERITY}.

The OCR output has the words: NE, 3, BRAZILIA. So their set is {NE, 3, BRAZILIA}.

Now, comparing the two sets. The ground truth has NE and 3, which are present in the OCR output. But the other words in the ground truth (Bharatmala, Road, To, Prosperity) are not in the OCR output. However, the OCR has BRAZILIA instead of BHARATMALA. The problem says to consider unique words in the ground truth and check if they appear in the OCR output, ignoring order, case, spacing, and typos. 

Wait, but the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But in this case, the OCR output has NE and 3, which are in the ground truth. However, the other words (Bharatmala, Road, To, Prosperity) are not present. So the OCR output only matches two words from the ground truth's unique set. 

But the categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Since there are some matches (NE and 3), but not all, the category would be 2. However, I need to check if the OCR output has any typos that could be considered as matches. For example, "BRAZILIA" vs "BHARATMALA". Are they considered typos? The problem says small typos still count as matches. But "BRAZILIA" and "BHARATMALA" are not small typos; they are completely different words. So that's not a match. So the OCR output has NE and 3, which are correct, but the rest are not. So the OCR output has two correct words out of six. 

So according to the categories, since at least one (actually two) words match but not all, the category is 2. Therefore, the answer should be 2.
