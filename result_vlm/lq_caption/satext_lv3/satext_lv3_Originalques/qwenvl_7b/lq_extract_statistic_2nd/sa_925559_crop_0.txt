gt_text: SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SPIETH".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SPIETH SPIETH SPIETH", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'SPIETH'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the image reads "SPIETH". So the extracted text is just "SPIETH".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "SPIETH" repeated three times. But since the instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth, I should look at unique words. The ground truth has only one unique word: "SPIETH".

Now, checking the OCR output's extracted text. The OCR output has "SPIETH" once. The comparison rules say to ignore order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, small typos still count as matches. Here, the OCR output has exactly "SPIETH" once, which matches the unique word in the ground truth. 

So, all unique ground truth words (which is just "SPIETH") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, this should be a correct match. Even though the OCR output only has one instance instead of three, the problem states to compare based on the set of unique words, not the count. So the category is 1.
