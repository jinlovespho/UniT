gt_text: TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 19 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "TUUM SUB PRÆSIDI UM" and the VLM OCR output is "19". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The OCR text in the image is: ``` 19 ```". So the actual extracted text here is "19". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has words like TUUM, SUB, PRÆSIDI, and UM. The OCR output is just the number 19. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, the OCR output here is "19", which is a number, not any of the words in the ground truth. 

The categories are:
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output.
2 — Partially correct if at least one word matches.
3 — Incorrect if none match or output is unrelated.

Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth (they are all Latin words, and "19" is a number), there's no match. Therefore, it falls under category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 157
2. Slightly Correct Num: 70
3. Incorrect Num: 411
