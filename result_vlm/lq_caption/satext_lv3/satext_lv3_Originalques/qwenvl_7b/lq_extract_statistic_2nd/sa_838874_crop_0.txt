gt_text: PKL
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "PKL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PKL". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'PKL'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "PKL" in quotes. So the extracted text here would be "PKL".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "PKL", which is exactly the same as what the OCR output has. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. We check if all unique words in the ground truth are present. The ground truth has one unique word, "PKL", and the OCR output also has "PKL". 

Also, the rules mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But in this case, the OCR output has "PKL" exactly as the ground truth, so no issues there. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here.

So all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
