gt_text: PKP
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "100%".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PKP", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads '100%'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the extracted text would be "The text in the image reads '100%'." But I should probably remove the quotes around the percentage, so it's just "100%".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "PKP", which is three letters. The OCR output has "100%". Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "PKP"—is that a single word or three separate letters? The problem says "unique words in the ground truth", but "PKP" is a single word. So the unique words in the ground truth are just ["PKP"].

Now, the OCR output's extracted text is "The text in the image reads 100%". The unique words here are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads", "100%". But since we ignore case, "The" and "the" would be considered the same. However, the ground truth word is "PKP", which is not present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "100%", which is a number and a percentage sign. There's no mention of "PKP" in the OCR output. 

The instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches, but since "PKP" isn't even close to "100%", there's no match here. Also, word order doesn't matter, but since the OCR output doesn't have "PKP" at all, there's no match. 

Therefore, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. So according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect, because no words match.
