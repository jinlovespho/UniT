gt_text: CHINA EASTERN EASTERN
vlm_output: CHINA EASTERN

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CHINA EASTERN EASTERN" and the VLM OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "CHINA EASTERN". Now, I have to compare this with the ground truth.

The ground truth has two words: "CHINA" and "EASTERN". But "EASTERN" is repeated twice. However, the instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "CHINA" and "EASTERN".

Next, I need to check if the OCR output contains all these unique words. The OCR output has "CHINA" and "EASTERN" once each. Even though the ground truth has "EASTERN" twice, the unique set is just the two words. The OCR output has both of them. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, spacing, typos. The OCR output has the correct words, even though it's missing one instance of "EASTERN". But since we're looking at unique words, not counts, it's okay. Also, there are no typos here. 

So, the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, it should be category 1.
