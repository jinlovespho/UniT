gt_text: SMOKING
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SMOKING".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "SMOKING". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'SMOKING'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the text is "SMOKING", so the extracted text here is "SMOKING".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "SMOKING". Now, considering the guidelines:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue.
- Compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SMOKING".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Both are all caps and no punctuation or spaces, so they match exactly.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here.

Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth word, and all unique words (just one) are present, this should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer is 1.
