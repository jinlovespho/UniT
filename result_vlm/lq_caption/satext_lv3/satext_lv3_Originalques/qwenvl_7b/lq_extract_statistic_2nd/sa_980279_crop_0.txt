gt_text: D 65
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '3986 D'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "D 65" and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '3986 D'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "3986 D". So the extracted text here is "3986 D". 

Next, I compare this with the ground truth "D 65". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence. Also, I should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "D" and "65". 

Now, checking the OCR output: "3986 D". The words here are "3986" and "D". Comparing to the ground truth's unique words, "D" is present in both. But "65" isn't in the OCR output. Instead, there's "3986". 

The rules mention that small typos still count as matches. However, "3986" is not a typo of "65". It's a different number entirely. So "3986" doesn't match "65". 

So, in the OCR output, only "D" matches the ground truth. The other word "65" is missing. Since the ground truth has two unique words and the OCR output only matches one, this would be partially correct. According to the categories, category 2 is for when at least one but not all unique words match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
