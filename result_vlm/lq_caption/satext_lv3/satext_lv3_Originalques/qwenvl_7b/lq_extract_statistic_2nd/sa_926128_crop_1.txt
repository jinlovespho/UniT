gt_text: LaLiga
vlm_output: LaLiga

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LaLiga" and the VLM OCR output is also "LaLiga". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "LaLiga".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "LaLiga". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking for case, punctuation, and spacing. Both are exactly the same in terms of capitalization and spacing. There are no typos mentioned, so even if there were small ones, they'd still count as matches. 

Since the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth, the category should be 1 — Correct.
