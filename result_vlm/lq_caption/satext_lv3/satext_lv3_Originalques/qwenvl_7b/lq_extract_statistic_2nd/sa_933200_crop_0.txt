gt_text: CAS 4C
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '1813'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CAS 4C" and the OCR output is "1813". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is just "1813". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CAS" and "4C". The OCR output has "1813", which is a number. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "CAS" and "4C" are not present in "1813". The OCR output is a four-digit number, which doesn't match either of the words in the ground truth. 

Also, considering that typos are counted as matches if they're small, but here the words are completely different. The OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. So according to the categories, if none of the unique words match, it's category 3. 

So the answer should be 3.
