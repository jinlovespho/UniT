gt_text: CROSSWIND M/T
vlm_output: The image appears to be a close-up of a vehicle tire and part of the wheel well. There is no visible text in the image that can be read.

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CROSSWIND M/T". The VLM OCR output says there's no visible text in the image. So, the OCR didn't detect any text.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that there's no visible text. So, the extracted text is essentially empty or "no text".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CROSSWIND" and "M/T". The OCR output didn't find any text, so there are no words to match. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even if there was a typo or something, but here the OCR says there's no text at all. So, it's not even partially correct. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
