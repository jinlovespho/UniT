gt_text: SAMSUNG SAMSUNG SAMSUNG
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SAMSUNG".

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "SAMSUNG SAMSUNG SAMSUNG". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'SAMSUNG'."

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "SAMSUNG" once. The ground truth has "SAMSUNG" repeated three times, but we're only considering unique words. So the unique word in the ground truth is just "SAMSUNG".

Now, Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules say word order doesn't matter, and we compare based on the set of unique words. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. So the OCR output has "SAMSUNG" once, which matches the unique word in the ground truth. Even though the OCR didn't capture the repetition, since we're only looking at unique words, that's okay. Also, there are no typos here; the OCR correctly identified "SAMSUNG".

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. The ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output includes that word. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
