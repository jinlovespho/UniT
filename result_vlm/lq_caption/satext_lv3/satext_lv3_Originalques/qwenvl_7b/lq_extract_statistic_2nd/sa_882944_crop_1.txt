Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SPORTAGE" and the VLM OCR output is also "SPORTAGE". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. Both are "SPORTAGE".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos are still considered matches.

The ground truth has one word: "SPORTAGE". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor differences like case (but here they are both uppercase), it would still count. Since there's only one unique word in the ground truth, and the OCR output contains that exact word (with no typos, same case, same spacing), it should be a full match.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, it's category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output isn't missing any words. So the answer should be 1.
