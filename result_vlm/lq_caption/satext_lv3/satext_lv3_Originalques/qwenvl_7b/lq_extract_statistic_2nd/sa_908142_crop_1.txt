gt_text: EPSON Castrol
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "EPSON Castrol".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EPSON Castrol" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'EPSON Castrol'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says the text reads "EPSON Castrol", so the extracted text here is "EPSON Castrol". 

Now, comparing that with the ground truth, which is the same exact text. But the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has two unique words: "EPSON" and "Castrol". The OCR output also has those exact words. Even though the OCR output has additional text like "The text in the image reads", the extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

So, since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, etc.), this should be category 1. There's no missing words, no typos, and the words are present. Even if there were minor typos, like "Epson" instead of "EPSON", it's still considered a match. But in this case, the OCR output is exactly correct. 

Therefore, the answer is category 1.
