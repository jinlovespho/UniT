gt_text: pttstation
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "pttstation".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "pttstation". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'pttstation'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "pttstation". So the extracted text here is "pttstation".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "pttstation". So they are exactly the same. But the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. Also, check if unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth has one unique word: "pttstation". The OCR output also has that same word. 

Other factors: ignore capitalization, but both are lowercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. No typos here since they are identical. 

So all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, it's category 1.
