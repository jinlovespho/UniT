gt_text: NIKE
vlm_output: The text in the image is "NIKE".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NIKE". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is 'NIKE'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the actual text here is "NIKE" enclosed in quotes. So the extracted text is "NIKE".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is also "NIKE". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NIKE".

The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "NIKE", so it's a perfect match. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. There are no typos, extra spaces, or punctuation to worry about. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, this should be category 1: Correct.
