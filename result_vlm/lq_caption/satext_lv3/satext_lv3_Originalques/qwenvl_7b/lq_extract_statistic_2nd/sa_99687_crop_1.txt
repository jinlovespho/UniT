gt_text: ABB

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ABB" and the VLM OCR output is also "ABB". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "ABB".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth is "ABB" which is one word. The OCR output is also "ABB". Since they are identical, even if there were minor typos, but here there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "ABB". The OCR output has the same word. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique words match. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, it should be category 1. There's no case difference, no extra spaces, no typos. So the answer is 1.
