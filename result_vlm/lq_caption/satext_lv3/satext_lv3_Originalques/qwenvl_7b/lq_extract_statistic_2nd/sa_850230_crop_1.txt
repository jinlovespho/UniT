gt_text: XIV SEC.
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "1975"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "XIV SEC." and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: '1975'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads: '1975'". So the actual extracted text here is "1975".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth "XIV SEC." Let's break down the steps. The ground truth has two words: "XIV" and "SEC". The OCR output has "1975", which is a number. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "XIV" and "SEC". The OCR output has "1975", which is a number, not matching either of those words. 

Even if we consider typos, "1975" doesn't resemble "XIV" or "SEC". Also, the OCR output is a year, which is unrelated to the ground truth text. 

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, according to the categories, this would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is largely wrong and unrelated.
