gt_text: RESTAURACJA
vlm_output: RESTAURACJA

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "RESTAURACJA" and the VLM OCR output is also "RESTAURACJA". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, that's straightforward. The extracted text is "RESTAURACJA".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but here both texts are the same word. Also, we need to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has one word, "RESTAURACJA", and the OCR output has the same word, the unique words match.

The other considerations are about ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, both are all caps with no spaces or punctuation. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's present, that's a Category 1. There's no partial match here because the OCR output is exactly the same. So the answer should be 1.
