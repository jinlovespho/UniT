gt_text: WORLD CENTER NEW
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "HARBO HOTEL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "WORLD CENTER NEW" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'HARBO HOTEL'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the image reads "HARBO HOTEL". So the extracted text here is "HARBO HOTEL". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "WORLD", "CENTER", and "NEW". The OCR output has "HARBO" and "HOTEL". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so I just need to check if any of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, I should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. However, even small typos still count as matches. 

Looking at the words, "HARBO" vs. "WORLD" – no match. "HOTEL" vs. "CENTER" or "NEW" – no match either. There's no overlap between the words in the OCR output and the ground truth. The OCR output has entirely different words. 

So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even if there were a typo, like "HARBO" being a misspelling of "WORLD", but that's not the case here. So the answer should be 3.
