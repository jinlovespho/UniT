gt_text: verbal
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "verbal".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "verbal". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'verbal'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "verbal" in quotes. So the extracted text here would be "verbal" because that's the actual text mentioned.

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "verbal". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "verbal", so they are the same. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in both cases, order isn't an issue here. Also, we check unique words. The ground truth has one unique word, and the OCR output has the same. 

Capitalization, punctuation, spaces—there's no capitalization difference here, and no punctuation or spaces to consider. The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "verbal", matching the ground truth. 

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here. So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, the category should be 1 — Correct.
