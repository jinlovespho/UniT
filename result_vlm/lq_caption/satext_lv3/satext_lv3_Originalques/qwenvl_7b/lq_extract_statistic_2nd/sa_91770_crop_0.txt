gt_text: 28
vlm_output: The number in the image is "28".

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "28". The VLM OCR output is "The number in the image is "28"." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the extracted text would be "The number in the image is 28".

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the unique word "28". The OCR output includes "28" as well. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. The ground truth has only one unique word, which is "28". The OCR output includes "28" exactly. Also, the rules say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "28" in quotes, but the ground truth doesn't have quotes. However, the rules mention ignoring punctuation, so the quotes can be disregarded. Also, the OCR output has other words like "The", "number", "in", "the", "image", "is", but the ground truth only has "28". However, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth's unique word is "28", we just need to check if that word is present in the OCR output. 

The OCR output does contain "28", so all unique ground truth words are present. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the comparison is only about the unique words from the ground truth. So this would fall under category 1 — Correct.
