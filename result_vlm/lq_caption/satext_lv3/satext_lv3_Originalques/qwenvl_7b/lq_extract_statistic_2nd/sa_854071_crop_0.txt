gt_text: NANTES
vlm_output: NANTES

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "NANTES" and the VLM OCR output is also "NANTES". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "NANTES", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But here, both texts are single words. So the order is the same, but even if it weren't, since there's only one word, order isn't an issue here.

The comparison should be based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "NANTES". The OCR output also has "NANTES". 

Now, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, no punctuation, and no spaces. So they match exactly in that aspect. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one unique word and it's present, this should be Category 1. 

No possibility of partial matches here because there's only one word. So the answer must be 1.
