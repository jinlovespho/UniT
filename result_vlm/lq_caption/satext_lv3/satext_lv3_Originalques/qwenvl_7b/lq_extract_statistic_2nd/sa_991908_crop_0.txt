gt_text: ONE WAY Av 4
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` 40 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "ONE WAY Av 4" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  ``` 40 ```". The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) this falls into based on the given criteria.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image reads:  ``` 40 ```". So the actual text content here is "40" because the rest is just a description. The triple backticks might be formatting, but the main extracted text is "40".

Next, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "ONE", "WAY", "Av", and "4". But the OCR output only has "40". 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth words are "ONE", "WAY", "Av", and "4". The OCR output has "40". 

But wait, the OCR output is "40", which is a number. The ground truth has "4" as a separate word. So, does "40" contain "4"? Well, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. However, "40" is not just "4" with a typo. It's a different number. Also, the ground truth has "Av" which might be an abbreviation for Avenue, but the OCR output doesn't have that. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "ONE", "WAY", "Av", "4". The OCR output has "40". None of these words are present in the OCR output. Even if we consider "4" as part of "40", but according to the rules, we need to match the exact words (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), but "40" isn't one of the words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "4" as a separate word, so "40" isn't a match for that. 

Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Even though "40" has a '4', the presence of the '0' makes it a different number. Since the ground truth has "4" as a standalone word, and the OCR output has "40", which isn't a match, there's no correct word in the OCR output. 

So the answer should be 3.

2. Slightly Correct Num: 111
3. Incorrect Num: 596
