gt_text: LIBERTE
vlm_output: LIBERTE

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided the ground truth text as "LIBERTE" and the VLM OCR output as "LIBERTE". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison criteria given.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "LIBERTE", that's straightforward. 

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The comparison has several considerations: word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces, and small typos are still considered matches.

Looking at the ground truth, "LIBERTE" is a single word. The OCR output is also "LIBERTE". Since both are the same, even though they're in all caps, the instruction says to ignore capitalization. Also, there's only one unique word in the ground truth, which is "LIBERTE". The OCR output has the same word. 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is for when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since there's only one word and it's present, this should be Category 1. There's no mention of any typos here because the words are identical. Even if there were minor typos, the instruction says they still count as matches. 

I don't see any issues here. The OCR output matches exactly, so it's a correct match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
