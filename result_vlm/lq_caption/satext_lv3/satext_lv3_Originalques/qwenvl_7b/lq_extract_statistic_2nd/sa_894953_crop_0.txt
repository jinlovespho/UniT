gt_text: 52093 mobile
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is: '52093'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "52093 mobile" and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is: '52093'". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the number '52093' in quotes. So the extracted text would be "52093". Wait, but the original OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is: '52093'". So when extracting the text content, do we take the entire sentence or just the part inside the quotes? The instruction says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." The example given in the problem might help. The ground truth is "52093 mobile", and the OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is: '52093'". The user probably wants the OCR output's text, which is the quoted part '52093', but maybe the entire sentence? Hmm, but the way the problem is structured, maybe the extracted text is the actual OCR result, which is '52093', not the surrounding text. So the extracted text would be '52093'.

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has only "52093". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one word. 

The comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and typos. So, the OCR output has "52093", which is exactly the same as the first part of the ground truth. The second word in the ground truth is "mobile", which is not present in the OCR output. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one of the two words is present. So that's not Category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since one word matches (52093) and one doesn't (mobile), this would be Category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. But here, one does match, so it's not 3.

Wait, but the OCR output is only '52093', which is one of the words. So the answer should be Category 2. However, maybe the problem considers that the OCR output is missing "mobile" entirely. So, the unique words in the ground truth are "52093" and "mobile". The OCR output has "52093" but not "mobile". Therefore, only one of the two words is present. So according to the categories, that's Category 2 (partially correct).
