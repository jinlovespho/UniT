gt_text: 154 T
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is: '154'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "154 T". The VLM OCR output says "The OCR text in the image is: '154'". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has the text '154' enclosed in quotes. So the extracted text is just '154'.

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "154 T". Let's break down the unique words in the ground truth. The words are "154" and "T". 

The OCR output has "154" but not "T". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. But the OCR output doesn't have the "T" at all. So the unique words in the ground truth are two: "154" and "T". The OCR output has only one of them. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or largely wrong. Since the OCR output has one of the two unique words, that's partially correct. So the category should be 2.
