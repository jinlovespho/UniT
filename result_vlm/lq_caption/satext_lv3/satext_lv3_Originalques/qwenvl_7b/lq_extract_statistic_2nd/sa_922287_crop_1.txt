Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth is "AMBULANCE 13-110" and the OCR output is "CAPITALBUS". 

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "CAPITALBUS".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are "AMBULANCE" and "13-110". The OCR output has "CAPITALBUS" as a single word.

Now, checking the comparison rules. Word order doesn't matter, so we don't need to match the sequence. But we need to see if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, considering case, spacing, typos, etc.

Looking at "AMBULANCE" vs. "CAPITALBUS": they are completely different words. No letters in common except maybe "A" and "B" but not in the right order. "13-110" is a number with hyphens, and the OCR output has "CAPITALBUS", which is all letters. There's no overlap here.

The rules say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no match at all. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the ground truth words. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3: Incorrect.
