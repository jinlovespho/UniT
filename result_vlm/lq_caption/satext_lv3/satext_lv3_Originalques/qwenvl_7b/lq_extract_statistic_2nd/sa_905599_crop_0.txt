gt_text: NANOS PARFOIS GROUP FESTINA Hierro Pedro del
vlm_output: NANOS

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "NANOS PARFOIS GROUP FESTINA Hierro Pedro del". The VLM OCR output is just "NANOS". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's "NANOS". 

Next, comparing it to the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore that. The unique words in the ground truth are: NANOS, PARFOIS, GROUP, FESTINA, Hierro, Pedro, del. Wait, but the OCR output only has "NANOS". 

Now, checking if "NANOS" is present in the ground truth. Yes, it's the first word. So according to the criteria, if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. But wait, the OCR output only has one word, and the ground truth has seven unique words. So only one word matches. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or mostly wrong. Since only one word matches, that's at least one but not all. So it should be category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions say "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the OCR output needs to contain all of those words, but here it only contains one. So it's partially correct. Therefore, category 2.
