gt_text: in
vlm_output: The text in the image is "in".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "in". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is "in".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence: "The text in the image is "in"." So the actual text here is "The text in the image is in". Wait, the quotes might be part of the OCR output, but the user says to ignore punctuation. So maybe the quotes aren't important here.

Now, step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "in". The OCR output has the word "in" in it. Let's break it down.

The unique words in the ground truth are just {"in"}.

In the OCR output, the words are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "in". So the unique words here are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is". But we need to ignore case, so "The" and "the" are the same. Also, ignore extra spaces and punctuation. So the OCR output has the word "in" present. 

Since the ground truth is only the word "in", and the OCR output includes "in", then all unique ground truth words (which is just "in") are present in the OCR output. Even though there are other words, the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are present. Since "in" is there, that's a match. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct because all unique ground truth words are present. The other words in the OCR output don't matter as long as the required words are there. Even if there are extra words, as long as the required ones are present, it's category 1. 

I think the answer is 1.
