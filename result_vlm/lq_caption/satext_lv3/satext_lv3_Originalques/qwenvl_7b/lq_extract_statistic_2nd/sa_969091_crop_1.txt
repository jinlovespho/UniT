gt_text: Duke UNIVERSITY
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  Duke UNIVERSITY

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. Let me start by understanding the exact requirements.

First, the ground truth text is "Duke UNIVERSITY". The OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  Duke UNIVERSITY". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has some extra text like "The text in the image reads:" followed by the actual text. So, the extracted text would be "Duke UNIVERSITY" after removing the extra parts. Wait, but the user says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So maybe I need to consider the entire OCR output as the extracted text? But the example given in the problem seems to have the OCR output as "The text in the image reads:  Duke UNIVERSITY", so the actual text is "Duke UNIVERSITY" but with some surrounding text. However, the user might want the OCR output's text content, which is the part that's supposed to be the recognized text. So maybe the extracted text is "Duke UNIVERSITY", ignoring the "The text in the image reads:" part. But the problem statement says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output," which might mean that the entire OCR output is considered, but perhaps the actual text is the part after the colon. However, in the example, the OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  Duke UNIVERSITY", so the actual text here is "Duke UNIVERSITY". Therefore, the extracted text would be "Duke UNIVERSITY".

Now, Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth, considering the given conditions:

- Word order does not matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, the ground truth has two unique words: "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The OCR output's extracted text is "Duke UNIVERSITY". Let's process that. 

First, ignoring capitalization: "Duke" and "university" in the OCR output. The ground truth has "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". So, "Duke" matches exactly (case-insensitive), and "UNIVERSITY" in the ground truth is matched by "UNIVERSITY" in the OCR output. Wait, the OCR output's text is "Duke UNIVERSITY", so the words are "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY". The ground truth is "Duke UNIVERSITY", which is the same. So the unique words in the ground truth are "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY", and the OCR output has exactly those two words. 

But the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output must have all of them to be category 1. 

In this case, the OCR output has "Duke" and "UNIVERSITY", which are exactly the same as the ground truth. So all unique words match. Therefore, category 1.

But wait, let me check again. The OCR output's text is "Duke UNIVERSITY". The ground truth is "Duke UNIVERSITY". So the words are the same. The OCR output has both words. So all unique words from the ground truth are present. Hence, category 1. 

But what if there were typos? For example, if the OCR had "Duke Univeristy", that would still be considered a match because small typos count. But in this case, the OCR is exactly correct. So the answer should be 1.
