gt_text: IKEA
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "IKEA".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "IKEA". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'IKEA'." 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "IKEA" within quotes. So the extracted text would be "The text in the image reads 'IKEA'." But maybe we need to focus on the actual text content, which is "IKEA" as per the OCR's statement.

Wait, but the instruction says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The VLM OCR output is the entire sentence, but perhaps the actual extracted text is just "IKEA" because that's what the OCR detected. Or does the extraction include the entire sentence? Hmm, the example might clarify. Let me check the original problem again.

The ground truth is "IKEA", and the OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'IKEA'." So the OCR output is a description of the text in the image, which is "IKEA". Therefore, the extracted text from the OCR output would be the actual text it recognized, which is "IKEA". The rest of the sentence is just the OCR's way of reporting that it found the text.

So step 1: extract the text content, which is "IKEA".

Step 2: compare with ground truth. The ground truth is "IKEA". The OCR output's extracted text is "IKEA". So they are exactly the same. Considering the comparison rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here there's only one word.
- Compare based on unique words in ground truth. Ground truth has one unique word: "IKEA".
- Ignore case, punctuation, spaces. The OCR output's text is "IKEA", same as ground truth.
- Small typos still count as matches. There are no typos here.

So all unique words from ground truth are present. Therefore, category 1: Correct.
