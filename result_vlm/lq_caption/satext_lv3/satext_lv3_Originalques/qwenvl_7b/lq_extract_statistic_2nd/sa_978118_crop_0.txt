gt_text: TAKST BYGGKONTROLL
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "10"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the ground truth text is "TAKST BYGGKONTROLL" and the VLM OCR output is "10". The task is to compare these two based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR says "10", which is just the number ten. Now, the ground truth has two words: "TAKST" and "BYGGKONTROLL". 

Next, the comparison rules. The key points are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the OCR output here is "10", which is a number, not any of the words in the ground truth. 

The ground truth words are "TAKST" and "BYGGKONTROLL". The OCR output is "10", which doesn't match either of these words. Even if we consider typos, "10" isn't a variation of either word. There's no overlap in the words. So, according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. 

Wait, but maybe there's a typo? Like, could "10" be a typo for "TAKST" or "BYGGKONTROLL"? But "10" is a number, and the ground truth words are in Norwegian, I think. "TAKST" might be a term related to tax or toll, and "BYGGKONTROLL" could be building control. There's no way "10" would be a typo for either. So, no matches. Therefore, category 3 is the answer.
