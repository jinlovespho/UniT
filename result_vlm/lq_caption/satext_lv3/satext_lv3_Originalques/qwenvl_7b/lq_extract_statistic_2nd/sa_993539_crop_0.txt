gt_text: de
vlm_output: The text in the image is "de".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "de". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image is 'de'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text it's reporting is "de". So the extracted text would be "de".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is just "de". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "de". So the unique words in ground truth are {"de"}. The OCR output has "de" as well. 

Considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. Ignore capitalization, but both are lowercase. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. Typos are considered matches if small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That should be category 1. The answer is 1.
