gt_text: STATES UNITED PARK POLICE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE"

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STATES UNITED PARK POLICE". The VLM OCR output says "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE".

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in both. Let's break them down.

Ground truth words: STATES, UNITED, PARK, POLICE. Wait, "STATES" and "UNITED" are in the ground truth. The OCR output has "UNITED", "STATES", "PARK", "POLICE". So the unique words are the same. 

But wait, the ground truth is "STATES UNITED PARK POLICE", so the words are STATES, UNITED, PARK, POLICE. The OCR output is "UNITED STATES PARK POLICE", which are UNITED, STATES, PARK, POLICE. So all the same words. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So all the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, ignoring case, spacing, etc. The OCR output has the same words, just the order of STATES and UNITED is swapped. But since word order doesn't matter, that's okay. 

No typos here either. So according to the categories, this would be category 1: Correct. All unique ground truth words are present. So the answer should be 1.
