gt_text: EVERGREEN
vlm_output: EVERGREEN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EVERGREEN" and the VLM OCR output is also "EVERGREEN". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here because the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

Now, moving to step 2: comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are the same word, so order isn't an issue. The next point is comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EVERGREEN". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spacing, no punctuation. So that's all matching. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here. 

So the category is 1 because all unique ground truth words (just "EVERGREEN") are present in the OCR output. There's no missing words, no extra words, and everything matches. So the answer should be 1.
