gt_text: PAVIL JONKI
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "PAVILJONKI".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PAVIL JONKI" and the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads 'PAVILJONKI'." So the actual extracted text is "PAVILJONKI".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is one word: "PAVILJONKI". 

But the instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one word, which is "PAVILJONKI". 

Wait, but maybe "PAVILJONKI" is a typo for "PAVIL JONKI"? Like, the OCR might have merged the two words into one. The problem says that small typos still count as matches. So if "PAVILJONKI" is a typo where the space is missing between "PAVIL" and "JONKI", then maybe it's considered a match. 

But the ground truth has two words, and the OCR output has one. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output has "PAVILJONKI". If we split the OCR text into words, but it's one word. However, maybe the OCR is just missing the space. But the instruction says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe "PAVILJONKI" is considered as "PAVIL JONKI" with a missing space, but since we ignore spacing, the OCR output is considered to have the same words as the ground truth. 

Alternatively, the OCR output is a single word, but the ground truth has two. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. So the ground truth's set is {"PAVIL", "JONKI"}, and the OCR output's set is {"PAVILJONKI"}. But "PAVILJONKI" is a different word. However, the instruction says that small typos still count as matches. So maybe "PAVILJONKI" is considered a typo of "PAVIL JONKI" (with the space missing). But since the OCR output is a single word, does that count as containing both words? 

Wait, maybe the OCR output is "PAVILJONKI" which is a typo of "PAVIL JONKI". So the OCR output has the correct letters but merged into one word. Since the instructions say to ignore spacing, perhaps "PAVILJONKI" is considered equivalent to "PAVIL JONKI" because the space is just an extra/missing space. Therefore, the OCR output contains the same words as the ground truth. 

In that case, all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, so it's category 1. But I need to check if "PAVILJONKI" can be split into "PAVIL" and "JONKI" considering the typo. For example, "PAVILJONKI" might be a misspelling of "PAVIL JONKI" where the 'J' is added in the middle. Wait, "PAVILJONKI" is actually "PAVILJONKI" which is "PAVIL" + "JONKI" with a 'J' in between? Wait, the original ground truth is "PAVIL JONKI", which is "PAVIL" and "JONKI". The OCR output is "PAVILJONKI", which is "PAVIL" followed by "JONKI" but without the space. So maybe it's a typo where the space is missing. 

Since the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, then the OCR output "PAVILJONKI" would be considered as "PAVIL JONKI" (with the space ignored). Therefore, the OCR output contains both words from the ground truth. So category 1 would be correct.
