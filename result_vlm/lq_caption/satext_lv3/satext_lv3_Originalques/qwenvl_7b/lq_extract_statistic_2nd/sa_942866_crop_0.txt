gt_text: QATAR
vlm_output: QATAR

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "QATAR" and the VLM OCR output is also "QATAR". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "QATAR".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it's okay. But in this case, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "QATAR". The OCR output also has "QATAR". So the unique words match exactly.

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's fine. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since they're identical.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, that's a match. So the answer should be 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. The output is exactly correct.
