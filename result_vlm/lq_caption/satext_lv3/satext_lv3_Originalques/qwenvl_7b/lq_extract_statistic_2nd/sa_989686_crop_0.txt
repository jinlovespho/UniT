gt_text: 1986 3d
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "3d 1986"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1986 3d" and the VLM OCR output is "3d 1986". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "3d 1986". Then, comparing that to the ground truth "1986 3d". 

The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that shouldn't affect the comparison. Next, we look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "1986" and "3d". The OCR output also has "3d" and "1986". 

Now, checking if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Both "1986" and "3d" are there. Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, but in this case, both are lowercase except "3d" which is lowercase in both. No typos mentioned here, so they count as matches. 

Since all the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct.
