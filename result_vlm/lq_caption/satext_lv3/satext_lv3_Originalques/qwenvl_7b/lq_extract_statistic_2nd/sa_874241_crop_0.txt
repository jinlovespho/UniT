gt_text: Rai
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Rai".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Rai" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Rai'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads 'Rai'." So the actual text here is "Rai" enclosed in quotes. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "Rai". The OCR output has the exact same word "Rai", even though there's more text around it. The instructions say to consider only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one word, "Rai", and the OCR output includes that exact word (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), then all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, the guidelines mention that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output has the correct word. So according to category 1, which is correct if all unique ground truth words are present, this should be category 1. 

I don't see any other words in the ground truth. The OCR output has "Rai" exactly as in the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
