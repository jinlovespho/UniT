gt_text: GRUNO
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "KOKO".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "GRUNO" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'KOKO'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text is "KOKO". So the extracted text is just "KOKO".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "GRUNO". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so we just look at the words present. The ground truth has one unique word: "GRUNO". The OCR output has "KOKO". 

Now, checking if "KOKO" matches "GRUNO" considering the rules. The rules mention ignoring capitalization, so "KOKO" and "GRUNO" are both all caps. But the main thing is whether they are the same word. However, "KOKO" isn't "GRUNO". There's no overlap in the words. The unique words in ground truth are "GRUNO", and the OCR output has "KOKO". Since they are different words, there's no match. 

Also, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, "KOKO" is not a typo of "GRUNO". They are entirely different words. So there's no match. 

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it should be category 3: Incorrect.
