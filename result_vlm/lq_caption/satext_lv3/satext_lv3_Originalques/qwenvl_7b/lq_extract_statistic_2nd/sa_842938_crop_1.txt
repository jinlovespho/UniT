Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, let's look at the given texts. The ground truth is "Midea" and the OCR output is also "Midea". Both are exactly the same. 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "Midea", that's straightforward. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth, considering several factors: word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

In this case, both texts are identical. The ground truth has one unique word: "Midea". The OCR output also has "Midea". Since they are the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word and it's a perfect match, this should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues here. Even if there were typos, the note says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. 

So the answer should be 1.
