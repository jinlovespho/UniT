gt_text: Mercure Mercure
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Mercure".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Mercure Mercure". So the unique words here are just "Mercure" since it's repeated. The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'Mercure'." So the extracted text from the OCR is "Mercure". 

Now, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "Mercure" twice, but as unique words, it's still just one unique word. The OCR output has "Mercure" once. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"Mercure"}, and the OCR output's unique words are also {"Mercure"}. 

Even though the OCR output has only one instance, the ground truth has two, but since we're looking at unique words, the count doesn't matter. Also, the OCR output is correctly identifying "Mercure" once, which is the same as the unique word in the ground truth. 

The other factors: word order doesn't matter, capitalization is ignored (both are uppercase here), no punctuation issues, and no typos. So all the conditions for category 1 are met. The OCR output has all the unique ground truth words. So the answer should be 1.
