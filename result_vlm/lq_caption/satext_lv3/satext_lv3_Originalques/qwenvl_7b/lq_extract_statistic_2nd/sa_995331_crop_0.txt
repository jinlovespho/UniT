gt_text: BSN
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` BSN BANK OF SINGAPORE ```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text "BSN" and the VLM OCR output "The text in the image reads:  ``` BSN BANK OF SINGAPORE ```". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image reads:  ``` BSN BANK OF SINGAPORE ```". The actual text content here is "BSN BANK OF SINGAPORE". The rest is just the description of the OCR output, so the relevant part is the part inside the backticks: "BSN BANK OF SINGAPORE".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "BSN", which is a single word. The OCR output has "BSN" as the first word, followed by "BANK OF SINGAPORE". 

The comparison criteria are:
- Word order does not matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "BSN", the unique words here are just {"BSN"}.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, the OCR output's "BSN" is in uppercase, same as the ground truth, so capitalization isn't an issue here.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in "BSN" compared to the ground truth.

So, the OCR output contains the exact word "BSN", which matches the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output includes that word, even though there are other words present, the category should be 1 (Correct) because all unique ground truth words are present. 

The presence of additional words in the OCR output doesn't affect the category since the criteria only require that all unique words from the ground truth are present, regardless of other words. Even if there were more words, as long as the required ones are there, it's still category 1. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
