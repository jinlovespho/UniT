gt_text: PARQUE LORO ANIMAL EMBASSY
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "LORO PARQUE ANIMAL PARKWAY"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says: "The text in the image reads:  "LORO PARQUE ANIMAL PARKWAY"". So the actual extracted text here is "LORO PARQUE ANIMAL PARKWAY". I'll ignore the surrounding text and just focus on the part inside the quotes.

Next, the ground truth text is "PARQUE LORO ANIMAL EMBASSY". Now, I need to compare these two sets of words, considering the specified criteria. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the unique words in the ground truth and see if they are present in the OCR output, regardless of order. Also, I need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. Additionally, small typos still count as matches. 

Let me break down the words. The ground truth has the words: PARQUE, LORO, ANIMAL, EMBASSY. The OCR output has: LORO, PARQUE, ANIMAL, PARKWAY. 

Comparing the unique words from the ground truth to the OCR output:
- PARQUE is present in both (same word, case doesn't matter).
- LORO is present in both.
- ANIMAL is present in both.
- EMBASSY is in the ground truth but not in the OCR output. The OCR output has PARKWAY instead. 

So, three out of the four unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output (PARQUE, LORO, ANIMAL), but EMBASSY is missing. The OCR output has PARKWAY, which is a different word. 

The category definitions state that category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since EMBASSY is missing, it's not category 1. Category 2 is when at least one but not all unique words match. Here, three out of four words match. Wait, but the definition says "at least one but not all". If three out of four are present, that's more than one but not all. So that would be category 2. Category 3 is when none match or it's unrelated. That's not the case here. 

But wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has four unique words. The OCR output has four unique words as well, but only three of them are in the ground truth. So the OCR output has three matches (PARQUE, LORO, ANIMAL) and one different (PARKWAY). Therefore, since not all ground truth words are present, it's category 2. 

I should double-check if there's any possibility that PARKWAY could be considered a typo for EMBASSY. However, the instructions say that small typos still count as matches, but PARKWAY and EMBASSY are different enough. They are not typos of each other. So EMBASSY is not present in the OCR output. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
