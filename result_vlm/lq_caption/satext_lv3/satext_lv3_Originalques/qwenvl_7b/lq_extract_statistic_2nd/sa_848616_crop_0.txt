gt_text: 29
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1 ```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "29", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "1" inside triple backticks. So the extracted text here is just "1".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "29". The unique words in the ground truth are "29". Now, checking the OCR output's extracted text "1" against this. 

The problem says to consider word order doesn't matter, but here we have only one word each. The comparison is based on the set of unique words. The ground truth has "29" and the OCR has "1". 

Now, checking if "1" matches "29" considering possible typos. But "1" and "29" are different numbers. Even with typos, "1" isn't a typo of "29". The OCR output didn't capture the correct number. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "29") are present in the OCR output ("1"), that would fall under category 3: Incorrect. Because there's no match, and the output is largely wrong.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 38
2. Slightly Correct Num: 20
3. Incorrect Num: 68
