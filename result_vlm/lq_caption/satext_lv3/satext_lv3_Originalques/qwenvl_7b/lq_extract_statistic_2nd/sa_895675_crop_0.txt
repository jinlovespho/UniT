gt_text: PARKING RESERVED 142 E
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '142 E'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PARKING RESERVED 142 E". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '142 E'".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says the text is '142 E'. So the extracted text is just "142 E".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: PARKING, RESERVED, 142, E. But the OCR output only has 142 and E. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words in ground truth are "PARKING", "RESERVED", "142", "E". The OCR output has "142" and "E". 

So two out of four unique words match. But according to the categories, category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only two are present. But wait, the problem says "considering word order does not matter, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the OCR output needs to have all the unique words from the ground truth. Since the OCR output is missing "PARKING" and "RESERVED", it's not all. 

But the categories say category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear. Since only two are present, that's not category 1. Then, category 2 is at least one but not all. So that would be category 2. But wait, the OCR output has two words that are in the ground truth. However, the ground truth has four unique words. So the OCR output is missing two. So that's partially correct. 

But wait, the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the OCR output must have all the unique words from the ground truth. Since it's missing two, it's not category 1. But since it has some, it's category 2. 

So the answer should be 2. But let me check again. The ground truth words are PARKING, RESERVED, 142, E. OCR has 142 and E. So two words match. The other two are missing. So it's partially correct. Therefore, category 2.
