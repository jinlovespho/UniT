Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "INS ROCK". The VLM OCR output says there's no visible text in the image. So, the OCR didn't detect any text.

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "no visible text in the image that can be read." So, the extracted text is basically stating that there's no text present.

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "INS" and "ROCK". The OCR output says there's no text. So, the OCR didn't find any words, which means none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's saying there's no text, which contradicts the ground truth. Since the OCR didn't detect any words, the unique words from the ground truth aren't present. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
