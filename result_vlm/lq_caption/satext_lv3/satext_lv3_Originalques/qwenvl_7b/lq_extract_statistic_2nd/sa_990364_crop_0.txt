gt_text: SACRO CUORI VALLETTA
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "1975".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SACRO CUORI VALLETTA". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads '1975'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "1975" as the text in the image. So the extracted text is just "1975".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: SACRO, CUORI, VALLETTA. The OCR output has "1975", which is a number, not any of those words. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "1975" is a number and doesn't match any of the words SACRO, CUORI, or VALLETTA. Even if we consider typos or ignore case, there's no overlap. The OCR output didn't capture any of the words from the ground truth. 

So according to the categories, since none of the unique words match, it's category 3: Incorrect.
