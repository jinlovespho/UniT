gt_text: ETTE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "ETTE".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "ETTE" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'ETTE'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says the text reads "ETTE", so the extracted text here is "ETTE". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "ETTE". Now, looking at the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here.
- Unique words in the ground truth: The ground truth has one unique word, "ETTE".
- Ignore capitalization: The OCR output's "ETTE" is all caps, same as the ground truth. So that's fine.
- Punctuation and spacing: The OCR output has quotes around "ETTE", but the ground truth doesn't. However, the instructions say to ignore punctuation and extra spaces. So the quotes can be disregarded.
- Typos: There are no typos here; the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth.

Since the OCR output contains all the unique words from the ground truth (just "ETTE"), and there are no mismatches, it falls under category 1. There's no partial match or unrelated content here. The answer should be 1.
