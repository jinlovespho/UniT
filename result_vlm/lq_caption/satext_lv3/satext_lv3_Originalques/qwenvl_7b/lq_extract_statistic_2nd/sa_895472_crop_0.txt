gt_text: OVO
vlm_output: The text in the image is "OVO".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OVO". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is "OVO".".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is a sentence that says "The text in the image is "OVO"." So the actual text here is "OVO" within quotes. So the extracted text would be "OVO".

Step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "OVO", and the OCR output's extracted text is also "OVO". 

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "OVO". The OCR output has "OVO" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, ignoring case, spacing, etc., but since both are exactly the same, there's no issue. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but here there are no typos. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words match, it's category 1.
