gt_text: MICHAEL PENAMPANG SM ST
vlm_output: SM ST MICHAEL PENAMPANG

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MICHAEL PENAMPANG SM ST" and the OCR output is "SM ST MICHAEL PENAMPANG". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is already given as "SM ST MICHAEL PENAMPANG", so that's straightforward.

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the sequence of words. Also, I should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Let me list out the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has "MICHAEL", "PENAMPANG", "SM", and "ST". So those are the four unique words.

Now, looking at the OCR output: "SM ST MICHAEL PENAMPANG". Let's break that down into individual words. The words here are "SM", "ST", "MICHAEL", and "PENAMPANG". Comparing these to the ground truth words, they all match exactly. The order is different, but the problem states that order doesn't matter. Also, capitalization is ignored, but in this case, all words are in uppercase in both the ground truth and the OCR output, so that's not an issue. There are no typos mentioned here, and all words are present. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words. The instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are no typos. So everything checks out for category 1.
