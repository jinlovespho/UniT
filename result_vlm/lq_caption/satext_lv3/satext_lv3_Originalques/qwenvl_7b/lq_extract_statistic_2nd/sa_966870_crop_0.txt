gt_text: DB
vlm_output: DB

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DB" and the VLM OCR output is also "DB". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here. Both are just "DB".

Now, comparing them according to the given criteria. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since there's only one word in each, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DB". The OCR output also has "DB".

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. But in this case, both are uppercase and no punctuation or spaces. So that's not affecting anything here. Also, small typos count as matches, but there are no typos here since they are the same.

So all unique ground truth words (just "DB") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 1, it's correct. There's no missing words or any issues. The answer should be 1.
