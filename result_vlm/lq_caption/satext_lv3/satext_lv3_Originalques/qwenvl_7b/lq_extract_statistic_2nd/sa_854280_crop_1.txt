gt_text: TROPEZ SAINT
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SAINT TROPEZ".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "TROPEZ SAINT". The OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'SAINT TROPEZ'." 

**Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output.**  
The OCR output has additional text like "The text in the image reads" but the actual extracted text is "SAINT TROPEZ". So the relevant part here is "SAINT TROPEZ".

**Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth.**  
The ground truth words are "TROPEZ" and "SAINT". The OCR output has "SAINT" and "TROPEZ". 

Now, considering the comparison criteria:
- **Word order doesn't matter**: The OCR has "SAINT TROPEZ" versus ground truth "TROPEZ SAINT". Order is different but that's allowed.
- **Unique words in ground truth**: Both words are present in the OCR output.
- **Case, punctuation, spacing ignored**: The OCR uses uppercase, but the ground truth is all caps. However, the instruction says to ignore capitalization, so "SAINT" and "TROPEZ" match "TROPEZ" and "SAINT".
- **Typos**: There are no typos here; the words are exact matches.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, and the criteria are met, this should be category **1 — Correct**.
