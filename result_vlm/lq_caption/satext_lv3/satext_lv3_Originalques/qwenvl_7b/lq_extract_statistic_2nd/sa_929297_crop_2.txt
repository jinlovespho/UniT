gt_text: JBL SONY
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100% Cotton"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "JBL SONY". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  "100% Cotton"".

First step is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the actual extracted text would be "100% Cotton". Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth, which is "JBL SONY".

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "JBL" and "SONY". The OCR output has "100%", "Cotton". 

Now, checking if any of the OCR words match the ground truth words. "JBL" and "SONY" are brand names. The OCR output has "Cotton" which is a material, and "100%" which is a percentage. There's no overlap in the words. Even if I consider typos or case, but the words are completely different. "Cotton" isn't related to JBL or Sony. So none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
