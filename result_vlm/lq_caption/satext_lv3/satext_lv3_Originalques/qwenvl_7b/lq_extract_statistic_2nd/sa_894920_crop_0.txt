gt_text: P ZONE
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads:  ``` Bruges ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "P ZONE" and the VLM OCR output is "Bruges". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "Bruges". Then compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "P" and "ZONE". The OCR output has one word: "Bruges".

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. But we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth words are "P" and "ZONE". The OCR output is "Bruges". 

Looking at the words, "Bruges" doesn't contain "P" or "ZONE". Even if we ignore capitalization and spacing, there's no match. Also, there's no mention of typos here, but "Bruges" is a different word entirely. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
