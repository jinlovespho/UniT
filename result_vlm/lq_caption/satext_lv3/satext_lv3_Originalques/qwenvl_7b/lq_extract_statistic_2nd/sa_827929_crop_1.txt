gt_text: EEN 1-125
vlm_output: The text in the image appears to be "PILGRIM".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The ground truth text is "EEN 1-125" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image appears to be 'PILGRIM'." My task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image appears to be 'PILGRIM'." So the extracted text would be the words here. But the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "EEN 1-125". Let me break that down into unique words. The ground truth has three parts: "EEN", "1", and "125". But wait, "1-125" is a single unit here. Wait, the original ground truth is "EEN 1-125". So splitting by spaces, it's "EEN" and "1-125". So the unique words in the ground truth are "EEN" and "1-125".

Now, the OCR output is "The text in the image appears to be 'PILGRIM'." The words here are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "appears", "to", "be", "'PILGRIM'". But the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the instructions say: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the unique words in the ground truth are "EEN" and "1-125". So the OCR output needs to have these words, but considering the rules given.

But looking at the OCR output, there's no mention of "EEN" or "1-125". The OCR output says "PILGRIM" which is a different word. So the OCR output doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. 

Now, the categories: 

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos). 

In this case, the OCR output has none of the words from the ground truth. So category 1 is not met.

Category 2: at least one but not all unique words match. But here, there are zero matches. So category 2 isn't met either.

Category 3: Incorrect: no words match, or the output is largely wrong, unrelated, or empty. Since there are no matches, this would fall into category 3.

Wait, but the OCR output is "PILGRIM", which is a single word. The ground truth has two words. But the OCR output doesn't have any of them. So according to the rules, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it's category 3. 

But let me double-check the instructions again. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are "EEN" and "1-125". The OCR output has "PILGRIM", which is a different word. So no matches. Therefore, category 3.
