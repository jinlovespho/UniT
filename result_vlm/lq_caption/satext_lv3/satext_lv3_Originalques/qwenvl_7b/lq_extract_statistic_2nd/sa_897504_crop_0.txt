Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google" and the VLM OCR output is also "Google". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "Google".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Google". The OCR output also has "Google". 

Now, checking the other factors: ignoring capitalization. Both are capitalized as "Google", so that's the same. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here because there's no punctuation or extra spaces. Typos are mentioned to still count as matches, but there are no typos here since both are identical.

So, all unique words from the ground truth (just "Google") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output isn't empty or unrelated. So the answer should be 1.
