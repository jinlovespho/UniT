gt_text: TD
vlm_output: The text in the image is "TD".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "TD" and a VLM OCR output that says "The text in the image is 'TD'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, so the actual text mentioned is "TD" within quotes. So the extracted text is "TD".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "TD" as well. Now, looking at the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. But here, both are single words, so order is the same.
- Unique words in ground truth: "TD" is the only unique word. The OCR output also has "TD" as the only unique word.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and single word. So they match exactly.
- Small typos still count as matches. Since there are no typos here, it's a perfect match.

So all unique ground truth words (just "TD") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
