gt_text: Only taxi
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` Bike Only ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Only taxi". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  ``` Bike Only ```".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "Bike Only" inside the code block. So the extracted text is "Bike Only".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth "Only taxi". The unique words in the ground truth are "Only" and "taxi". The OCR output has "Bike" and "Only". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, so "Only" is present in both. But "taxi" is not in the OCR output. The OCR has "Bike" instead. The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR has one of the two words ("Only") but not the other ("taxi"). 

The categories: category 1 is if all unique words match. Here, only one matches. So it's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. That fits here. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. Since "Only" is present, it's not category 3.

So the answer should be 2.
