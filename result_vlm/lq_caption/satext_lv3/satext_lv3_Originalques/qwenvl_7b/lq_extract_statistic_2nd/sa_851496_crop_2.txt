gt_text: Jeep
vlm_output: Jeep

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Jeep" and the VLM OCR output is also "Jeep". 

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "Jeep".

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word. 

Next, comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Jeep". The OCR output also has "Jeep", so they match. 

Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spaces. Both are the same in terms of case (capital J), no punctuation, and no extra spaces. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here since both are identical.

So, all unique ground truth words (just "Jeep") are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, this would be category 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. The output is exactly the same as the ground truth, so it's a full match.
