vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  **WASHINGTON STREET EMT**

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says: "The text in the image reads: **WASHINGTON STREET EMT**". The actual text here is "WASHINGTON STREET EMT". The ground truth is "ARLINGTON STREET SW1 CITY WESTMINSTER OF".

Now, moving to Step 2: Comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order as not important, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

Let me break down the ground truth into unique words. The ground truth is "ARLINGTON STREET SW1 CITY WESTMINSTER OF". So the unique words are: ARLINGTON, STREET, SW1, CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF. Wait, but "SW1" might be a postcode or abbreviation, and "OF" is a preposition. 

The OCR output is "WASHINGTON STREET EMT". Let's split that into words: WASHINGTON, STREET, EMT. Now, ignoring case, let's compare. The ground truth has "STREET" which is present in the OCR output. The other words in the ground truth are ARLINGTON, SW1, CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF. The OCR output has WASHINGTON, EMT. 

Looking for matches. "STREET" is a match. The rest: ARLINGTON vs. WASHINGTON – these are different. SW1 vs. EMT – different. CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF are not present in the OCR output. So, only "STREET" matches. 

Now, the categories: Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one word matches. So that's not 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Since there's at least one (STREET), it's category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. But since there's one match, it's not 3. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has 5 unique words (ARLINGTON, STREET, SW1, CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF – wait, that's six words. Let me count again: ARLINGTON, STREET, SW1, CITY, WESTMINSTER, OF. Yes, six unique words. The OCR output has three words: WASHINGTON, STREET, EMT. Only "STREET" is common. So that's one match out of six. Therefore, it's partially correct, category 2.
