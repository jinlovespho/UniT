gt_text: STRETFORD END
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "SINCE 1960".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "STRETFORD END". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'SINCE 1960'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions the text is "SINCE 1960". So the extracted text is "SINCE 1960".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "STRETFORD" and "END". The OCR output has "SINCE" and "1960". 

Now, checking if any of the words match. The ground truth words are "STRETFORD" and "END". The OCR output has "SINCE" and "1960". None of these words are the same. Even if we consider typos, "SINCE" isn't close to "STRETFORD" or "END". "1960" is a number, not a word in the ground truth. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any unique words from the ground truth are present. Since neither "STRETFORD" nor "END" are in the OCR output, there are no matches. 

So according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it doesn't contain any of the required words. Therefore, the answer should be 3.
