gt_text: HUBERT
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "Karlova 12"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HUBERT". The OCR output from the VLM is "The text in the image reads: 'Karlova 12'". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The actual text here is "Karlova 12". The rest is just the VLM's way of presenting the result, like "The text in the image reads: ".

Now step 2 is comparing the extracted text "Karlova 12" with the ground truth "HUBERT". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But wait, the ground truth is a single word "HUBERT", which has no spaces. The OCR output has two words: "Karlova" and "12".

The unique words in the ground truth are just "HUBERT". The OCR output has "Karlova" and "12". So, do any of these match "HUBERT"? Let's check. 

First, "Karlova" vs "HUBERT". They are different words. "12" is a number, but the ground truth is a name. Even if we ignore case, "Karlova" isn't similar to "HUBERT". There's no overlap in the unique words. The OCR output doesn't contain "HUBERT" or any variation that could be considered a typo. So, according to the categories, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it's category 3: Incorrect. 

Wait, but the ground truth is "HUBERT" and the OCR output is "Karlova 12". There's no match. So the answer should be 3.
