gt_text: Nikon
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Nikon."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Nikon". The VLM OCR output says, "The text in the image reads 'Nikon.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "Nikon." So the extracted text here would be "Nikon".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is just "Nikon". The OCR output has the exact same word, even though it's in a sentence. The instructions say to ignore word order, capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. So even though the OCR output has extra words like "The text in the image reads", the actual text content extracted is "Nikon", which matches exactly.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Nikon". The OCR output's extracted text includes "Nikon" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present. There are no typos, and everything matches. So according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
