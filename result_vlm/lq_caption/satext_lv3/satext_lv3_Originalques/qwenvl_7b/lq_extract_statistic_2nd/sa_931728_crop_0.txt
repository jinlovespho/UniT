gt_text: UBS
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "UBS". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%"", so the extracted text here is "100%" and "100%". 

Now, step two is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The unique words in the ground truth are just "UBS". The OCR output has "100%" twice. 

The rules say to ignore word order, case, punctuation, and spaces. But the key is that we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has "UBS" and the OCR output has "100%", there's no overlap. Even if we ignore case and punctuation, "UBS" isn't present. 

Also, small typos are considered matches, but in this case, there's no typo—it's just a completely different word. So none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output. Therefore, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match...", the answer should be 3.
