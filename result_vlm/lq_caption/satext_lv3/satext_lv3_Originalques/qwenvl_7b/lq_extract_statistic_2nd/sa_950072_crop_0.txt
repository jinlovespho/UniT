gt_text: 1882 6
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1840 ```

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "1882 6". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1840 ```". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "1840" inside code delimiters. So the extracted text here is "1840".

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two numbers: 1882 and 6. The OCR output has 1840. 

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. But since these are numbers, maybe they are treated as words. The unique words in ground truth are "1882" and "6". The OCR output has "1840" as the only number. 

Comparing the sets: the OCR output has "1840", which is different from both "1882" and "6". So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

But wait, the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one word, "1840", which doesn't match either. So no matches. 

Therefore, according to the categories: category 3 is "Incorrect: no words match...". So the answer should be 3.
