gt_text: Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Tropical".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Tropical CERVEZA CANARIAS DE" and the OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Tropical'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says, "The text in the image reads 'Tropical'." So the actual extracted text here is "Tropical". 

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: Tropical, CERVEZA, CANARIAS, DE. Let me list them out as unique words. The OCR output only has "Tropical". 

Now, according to the rules: word order doesn't matter, so we just check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. But the OCR only has "Tropical" and the ground truth has four words. So even though "Tropical" is present, the other words (CERVEZA, CANARIAS, DE) are missing. 

The categories say that category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Here, only one out of four is present. So that's not category 1. Category 2 is when at least one but not all unique words match. Since "Tropical" is a match, and the others are not, this would be category 2. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "Tropical" as one of the words. The OCR output correctly identifies "Tropical", but misses the other three. So even though it's only one word, since it's at least one, it's category 2. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other possible matches. The OCR output doesn't have any other words from the ground truth. So yes, only "Tropical" matches. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
