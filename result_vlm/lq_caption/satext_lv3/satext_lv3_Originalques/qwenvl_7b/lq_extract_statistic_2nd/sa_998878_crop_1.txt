gt_text: UNITED STATES ARMY
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "1975".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "UNITED STATES ARMY". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads '1975'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "1975" as the text in the image. So the extracted text here is "1975".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "UNITED", "STATES", and "ARMY". The OCR output has "1975", which is a number, not any of those words. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "1975" doesn't match any of the words in the ground truth. Even if we ignore capitalization, punctuation, etc., "1975" is a number and not related to the words "UNITED", "STATES", or "ARMY". 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's no overlap in words. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it should be category 3—Incorrect.
