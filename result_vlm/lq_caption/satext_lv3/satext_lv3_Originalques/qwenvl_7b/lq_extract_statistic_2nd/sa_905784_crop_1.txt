gt_text: PRATAS
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` CERESI CERESI ```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "PRATAS" and the VLM OCR output is "CERESI CERESI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "CERESI CERESI". So the extracted text is just "CERESI CERESI".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "PRATAS". The OCR output has "CERESI" twice. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "PRATAS", the unique word is just "PRATAS".

Now, check if "PRATAS" appears in the OCR output. The OCR output has "CERESI", which is different. Even if I consider typos, "CERESI" doesn't look like "PRATAS". There's no overlap in the words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, and 3 if none match. Since there's no match here, the category should be 3. The OCR output has no words from the ground truth. Even if we consider case or spacing, "PRATAS" isn't present. So the answer is 3.
