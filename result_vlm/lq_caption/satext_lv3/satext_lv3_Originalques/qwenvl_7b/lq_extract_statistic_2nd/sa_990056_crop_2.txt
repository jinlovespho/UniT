gt_text: EI-DEC
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "1990"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "EI-DEC" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: "1990"".

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image reads: "1990"". So the extracted text would be "The text in the image reads: 1990". But maybe we should just focus on the actual numbers or words mentioned. The OCR output mentions "1990" as the text in the image. However, the ground truth is "EI-DEC". 

Now, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has the words "EI" and "DEC" (assuming hyphen is a separator, but maybe it's one word "EI-DEC"). Wait, the ground truth is "EI-DEC" as a single string. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, does "EI-DEC" count as one word or two? The hyphen might be part of the word. So maybe the unique words in the ground truth are just "EI-DEC". 

The OCR output's extracted text is "The text in the image reads: 1990". The words here are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads", "1990". The ground truth is "EI-DEC". So the OCR output has "1990" which is a number, not related to "EI-DEC". 

So comparing the unique words from the ground truth (which is "EI-DEC") with the OCR output's words. The OCR output has no words that match "EI-DEC" even considering typos, case, etc. "1990" is a number, not related. So there's no match. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3 - Incorrect. The OCR output didn't capture any part of the ground truth text. Even if we consider "EI" or "DEC" as separate words, the OCR output doesn't have those. The OCR output has "1990" which is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
