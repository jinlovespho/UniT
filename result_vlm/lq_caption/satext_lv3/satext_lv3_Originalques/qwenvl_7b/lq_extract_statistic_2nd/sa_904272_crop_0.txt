gt_text: PARKING
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "No Parking"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PARKING" and the OCR output is "The text in the image reads: 'No Parking'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "No Parking", so the extracted text is "No Parking".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "PARKING". The instructions say to ignore word order, case, spacing, and typos. Also, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "PARKING".

The OCR output has "No" and "Parking". Let's check if "Parking" matches "PARKING". Since we can ignore capitalization, "Parking" becomes "parking" and "PARKING" is the same when case is ignored. So "Parking" is a match for "PARKING". The word "No" isn't in the ground truth, but the ground truth only has "PARKING" as the unique word. So the OCR output includes "Parking" which is a match. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "PARKING") are present in the OCR output. So category 1 applies.
