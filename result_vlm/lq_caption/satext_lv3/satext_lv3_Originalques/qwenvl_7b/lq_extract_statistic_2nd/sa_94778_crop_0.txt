gt_text: AMB
vlm_output: The OCR text from the image is: '10'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMB" and the VLM OCR output is "10". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is straightforward here—it's just "10". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "AMB", but the OCR output has "10". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since "AMB" is a single word and "10" is another single word, there's no overlap in the actual words. 

The categories are based on whether the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth's unique word is "AMB", and the OCR output's unique word is "10". These are entirely different. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but in this case, there's no punctuation or spacing to ignore. The words themselves are different. Even if there were typos, like "AmB" vs "AMB", they would still match, but here the OCR output is "10" which isn't even close. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it falls under category 3—Incorrect. There's no match at all, and the output is unrelated.
