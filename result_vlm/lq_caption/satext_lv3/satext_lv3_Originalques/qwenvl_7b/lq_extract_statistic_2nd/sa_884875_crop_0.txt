gt_text: FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN
vlm_output: The image appears to be an aerial view of a small town or village with various buildings and structures. There is text visible in the image, but it seems to be partially obscured by the buildings and other elements. The text reads:  "100%"  This could indicate a percentage or some form of certification or label related to the area shown in the image. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of the text.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. My task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on specific criteria.

Starting with Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the text reads "100%". So the extracted text here is "100%".

Next, Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "FANSIPAN LEGEND LEGEND FANSIPAN". Let's break down the comparison according to the given rules.

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to check the sequence. I need to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". The OCR output has "100%", which is a different word. 

Now, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But "100%" is a number with a percentage sign. The ground truth words are all proper nouns, probably names. There's no overlap in the words themselves. Also, small typos count as matches, but here the words are entirely different. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The OCR output is "100%", which is unrelated to "FANSIPAN" and "LEGEND". 

Wait, but maybe I should check if "100%" could be a typo for any of the ground truth words? For example, if "100%" was mistyped as "FANSIPAN" or "LEGEND", but that's not the case here. The OCR output clearly states "100%", which is a different term. So there's no match. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
