gt_text: FM AM
vlm_output: AM FM

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "FM AM" and the VLM OCR output is "AM FM". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and categorize the result into one of three categories.

First, I need to follow the steps outlined. Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "AM FM". That's straightforward—there's no extra text or formatting mentioned, so I can take that as is.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria given are that word order doesn't matter, we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

Let me break down the ground truth and OCR output. The ground truth is "FM AM". The unique words here are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output is "AM FM", which also has the same two words: "AM" and "FM". 

Now, checking the criteria. Since the order doesn't matter, "AM FM" vs. "FM AM" are considered the same. Capitalization? Both are in uppercase, so no issue there. There are no typos mentioned here; the words are exactly the same. Also, there's no extra or missing spaces because both have two words separated by a space. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "FM" and "AM". The OCR output contains both of these words. So, all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would fall under category 1: Correct. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. In this case, there are no typos. The words are exactly the same, just in reverse order. Since order doesn't matter, this should be a correct match. 

I don't see any other factors here. The OCR output isn't missing any words or adding extra ones. It's just the same words in a different order. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
