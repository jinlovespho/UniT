gt_text: 13
vlm_output: The number in the image is "13".

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "13". The VLM OCR output is "The number in the image is "13"." 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The output is "The number in the image is "13"." So the text here includes words like "The", "number", "in", "the", "image", "is", and the number "13".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "13". The unique words in the ground truth are only the number "13". 

Now, looking at the OCR output, the extracted text includes "13" as part of the sentence. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth has only "13", we check if that appears in the OCR output. It does. 

The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, and we ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Here, the OCR output correctly includes "13" even though it's surrounded by other words. The other words in the OCR output are irrelevant because the ground truth only has "13". 

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (just "13") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
