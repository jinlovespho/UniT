gt_text: OAKLEY
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is: '1'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "OAKLEY". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is: '1'". So first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is '1', right? So the extracted text is just the number 1.

Now, comparing that with the ground truth, which is "OAKLEY". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "OAKLEY". The OCR output has the text '1', which is a number, not a word. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present in OCR, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has '1', which isn't related to "OAKLEY" at all. There's no match here. The OCR output doesn't contain any of the words from the ground truth. Even considering typos, but '1' is not a typo of "OAKLEY". So it's not even a partial match. Therefore, the category should be 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 156
2. Slightly Correct Num: 70
3. Incorrect Num: 400
