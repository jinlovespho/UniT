gt_text: GRANDE SHOP HOTO A
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "HOTO SHOP".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "GRANDE SHOP HOTO A". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'HOTO SHOP'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "HOTO SHOP", so the extracted text is "HOTO SHOP".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth into unique words, ignoring case, punctuation, and spacing. The ground truth words are "GRANDE", "SHOP", "HOTO", "A". But wait, "A" is a single letter. However, in the OCR output, there's "HOTO SHOP". 

So, looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "grande", "shop", "hoto", "a". The OCR output has "hoto" and "shop". The words "grande" and "a" are missing. But the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has four unique words, but the OCR output has two of them: "hoto" and "shop". 

Wait, but the instruction says "compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So, the OCR output needs to have all the unique words from the ground truth. But in this case, the OCR output is missing "grande" and "a". However, the ground truth includes "A" which is just the letter 'a'. The OCR output doesn't have that. 

But the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output is missing two words, that would not be category 1. Then, category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Here, two words match ("hoto" and "shop"), and two don't. So that would be category 2. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "HOTO" and "SHOP" which are present in the OCR output. "GRANDE" and "A" are missing. So, two out of four unique words match. So, since at least one but not all, it's category 2. 

But wait, the ground truth has "A" as a separate word. The OCR output doesn't have that. So, the OCR output has "hoto" and "shop" which are two of the four unique words. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
