gt_text: AMERICA 5330 BUILDING
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "RAILWAY AMERICA 5330"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AMERICA 5330 BUILDING". The VLM OCR output says "RAILWAY AMERICA 5330".

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward: "RAILWAY AMERICA 5330".

Next, compare it with the ground truth. The ground truth has three words: AMERICA, 5330, BUILDING. The OCR output has RAILWAY, AMERICA, 5330.

Now, the instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. So I should look at the set of words. The ground truth's unique words are AMERICA, 5330, BUILDING. The OCR output has RAILWAY, AMERICA, 5330. 

Comparing the sets: AMERICA and 5330 are present in both. But BUILDING is missing from the OCR output. RAILWAY is an extra word not in the ground truth. 

The criteria for category 1 is that all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Here, BUILDING is missing, so that's not met. 

Category 2 is if at least one but not all match. Here, two words (AMERICA and 5330) match, which is more than one but not all three. So that would be category 2. 

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to have all the words from the ground truth, but can have extra words. So even if there's an extra word, as long as all the ground truth words are present, it's category 1. But in this case, BUILDING is missing. So the OCR output is missing BUILDING. Therefore, it's not category 1. 

So category 2: partially correct. Because two out of three words match. The other word (BUILDING) is missing. So the answer is 2.
