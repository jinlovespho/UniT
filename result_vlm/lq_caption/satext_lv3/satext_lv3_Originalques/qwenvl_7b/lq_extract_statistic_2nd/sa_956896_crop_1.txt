gt_text: 226
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "TATA"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "226" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: 'TATA'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "TATA" is in the image. But the ground truth is "226". 

Now, comparing the extracted text "TATA" with the ground truth "226". The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about that. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "226" since it's a single number. The OCR output has "TATA", which is a word, but it's not the same as "226". 

The categories say that for a correct match (category 1), all unique ground truth words must appear in the OCR output. Here, the ground truth has "226", and the OCR output has "TATA". These are different words. Even if I consider typos, "TATA" isn't a typo of "226". There's no overlap in the words. 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it would fall under category 3, which is incorrect. The OCR output isn't related to the ground truth text. Even though "TATA" is a word, it's not matching "226" in any way. So the answer should be 3.
