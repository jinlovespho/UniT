gt_text: Richards St.
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "14 St"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Richards St." and the OCR output from the VLM is "14 St". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  "14 St"" so the actual extracted text here is "14 St". 

Next, I have to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so I don't have to worry about the sequence. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "Richards" and "St". 

Now, looking at the OCR output, "14 St" has "14" and "St". The "St" matches the "St" in the ground truth. However, "14" doesn't match "Richards". The problem says to consider small typos as matches, but "14" is a number and "Richards" is a name, so they aren't typos of each other. 

The category criteria are: 
1 — Correct if all unique ground truth words are present. 
2 — Partially correct if at least one matches but not all. 
3 — Incorrect if none match or it's unrelated. 

In this case, "St" is a match, but "Richards" isn't present in the OCR output. Since only one of the two unique words matches, the category should be 2 — Slightly correct (partially correct).

LLM classification result: 2
1. Correct Num: 179
2. Slightly Correct Num: 81
3. Incorrect Num: 446
