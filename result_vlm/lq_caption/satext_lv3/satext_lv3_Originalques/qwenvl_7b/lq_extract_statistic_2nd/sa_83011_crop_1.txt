Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "CJ03ADM DUSTER" and the VLM OCR output is "1234567890". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is just a string of numbers: "1234567890". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER". The OCR output has no letters, only numbers. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "CJ03ADM" and "DUSTER". The OCR output doesn't have any letters, so there's no overlap in words. 

Even if we consider typos or other factors, the OCR output is entirely numbers, which don't match any part of the ground truth words. Since there are no matching words, even partially, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
