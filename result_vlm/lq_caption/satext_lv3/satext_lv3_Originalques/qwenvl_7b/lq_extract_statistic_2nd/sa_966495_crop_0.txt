gt_text: DURANCE POW
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "PRODURANCE".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DURANCE POW", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'PRODURANCE'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "PRODURANCE", so that's the main text here. Now, comparing this with the ground truth. 

The ground truth has two words: "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has "PRODURANCE". Let me break it down. If I ignore case, "PRODURANCE" could be seen as a combination of "PRO" + "DURANCE". But the original ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". 

Wait, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has "PRODURANCE", which is a single word. 

Now, considering that word order doesn't matter, but the OCR output only has one word. However, the ground truth has two. But the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So do I check if each of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output?

Looking at "DURANCE" in the OCR output. The OCR has "PRODURANCE", which includes "DURANCE" as a substring. However, the problem says to consider small typos as matches. But "PRODURANCE" isn't exactly "DURANCE" with a typo; it's more like a prefix. Wait, but maybe "PRODURANCE" is a typo for "DURANCE POW"? Like maybe the OCR combined them into one word. But the ground truth is two words.

The instructions say that small typos still count as matches. So if "PRODURANCE" is a typo of "DURANCE", but the ground truth also has "POW". The OCR output doesn't have "POW" at all. So the OCR output has "DURANCE" (as part of PRODURANCE) but not "POW". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "DURANCE" and "POW". The OCR output has "PRODURANCE" which includes "DURANCE" but not "POW". So only one of the two words from the ground truth is present. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. So the answer should be 2.
