gt_text: CROWN
vlm_output: CROWN

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CROWN" and the VLM OCR output is also "CROWN". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here since the OCR output is exactly "CROWN".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "CROWN". The OCR output also has "CROWN". 

Now, checking the conditions: ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase. Punctuation and spaces aren't an issue here since there are none. Typos are considered as matches if they're small, but there are no typos here. 

So all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means it's category 1: Correct. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word matches exactly. So the answer should be 1.
