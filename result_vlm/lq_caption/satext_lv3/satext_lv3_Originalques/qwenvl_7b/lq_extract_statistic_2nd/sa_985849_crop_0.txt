gt_text: Municipio Palazzo Mosti
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Municipio Palazzo Mosti". The OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 10 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "10". The rest is just a description of the OCR result, so the actual extracted text is "10".

Now, comparing "10" with the ground truth words. The ground truth has three words: Municipio, Palazzo, Mosti. The OCR output is just the number 10. None of these words are present in the OCR output. Even if I consider typos or different forms, "10" doesn't match any of the words. The categories say that if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
