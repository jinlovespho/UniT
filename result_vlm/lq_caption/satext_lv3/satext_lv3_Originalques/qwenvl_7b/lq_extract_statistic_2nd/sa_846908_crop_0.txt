gt_text: POLICE TW152 Raymarine SHORELINE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "POLICE".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "POLICE TW152 Raymarine SHORELINE". The OCR output from the VLM says "The text in the image reads 'POLICE'."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "POLICE" as the text in the image. So the extracted text is just "POLICE".

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words: POLICE, TW152, Raymarine, SHORELINE. But the OCR only captured "POLICE". 

The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words are POLICE, TW152, Raymarine, SHORELINE. The OCR output has only POLICE. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present (even with typos, case, spacing), 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or unrelated.

Here, the OCR output has one of the four unique words (POLICE). So that's at least one but not all. So according to category 2, which is slightly correct (partially correct). Even though the OCR missed the other words, it did get POLICE right. So the answer should be 2.
