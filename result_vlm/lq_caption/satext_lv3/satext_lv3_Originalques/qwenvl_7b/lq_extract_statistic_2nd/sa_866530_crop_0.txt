gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: MUSEUM

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM" and the VLM OCR output is also "MUSEUM". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "MUSEUM".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. Then, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MUSEUM". The OCR output also has "MUSEUM". 

Next, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are uppercase, no punctuation, and same spacing. So they match exactly here.

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one word and the OCR has that same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be category 1.
