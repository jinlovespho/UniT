gt_text: 45 1941
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '1941 15'

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "45 1941" and the OCR output is "1941 15". The task is to compare these two based on the given criteria.

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1941 15". So the words are "1941" and "15".

Next, step 2 is to compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has "45" and "1941". The unique words in ground truth are "45" and "1941". 

Now, the rules say word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore the order. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if the OCR output contains both "45" and "1941". 

But the OCR output has "1941" and "15". So "1941" is present, but "45" is not. The "15" is not in the ground truth. So the OCR output has one of the two words from the ground truth. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none or unrelated. Since the OCR has one correct word ("1941") and one incorrect ("15"), it's partially correct. So category 2. 

Wait, but the ground truth has "45" and "1941". The OCR has "1941" and "15". So only "1941" is present. So that's one out of two unique words. So it's partially correct. Therefore, category 2.
