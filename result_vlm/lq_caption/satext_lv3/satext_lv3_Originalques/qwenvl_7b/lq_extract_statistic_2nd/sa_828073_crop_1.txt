Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "DALIAN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "DALIAN".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, both are the same word. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "DALIAN". The OCR output also has "DALIAN". 

Now, considering the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same spelling, no punctuation or spaces. So they match exactly. Also, small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

So the OCR output has all the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and all the words match. The other categories don't apply here because there's no partial match or no match at all. So the answer is 1.
