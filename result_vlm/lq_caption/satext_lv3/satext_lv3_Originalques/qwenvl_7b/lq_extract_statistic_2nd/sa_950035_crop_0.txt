gt_text: 60
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '60'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "60" and a VLM OCR output that says "The OCR text in the image reads: '60'". The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules given.

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The OCR text in the image reads: '60'". So the extracted text would be all the words here. But wait, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "60", which is a single word. 

Now, Step 2 is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The rules mention that word order doesn't matter, we should consider only the unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "60". The OCR output has several words: "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads", "'", "60", "'". 

But the instruction says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we're looking for the presence of "60" in the OCR output. The OCR output does contain "60" as a word. The other words in the OCR output are not part of the ground truth's unique words, but since the ground truth only has "60", we just need to check if "60" is present.

The rules also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, in this case, the OCR output has "60" exactly as in the ground truth. There's no typo here, so it's a direct match. Since "60" is present in the OCR output, all unique ground truth words (which is just "60") are present. Therefore, according to category 1, which is "Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output", this should be category 1.

I should make sure there's no other consideration. The OCR output has more words, but the comparison is only about the unique words in the ground truth. Since "60" is there, even though other words are present, it's still a correct match. The other words don't affect the category because the ground truth only has "60". So the answer is category 1.
