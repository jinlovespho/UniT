gt_text: 86346
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "86346"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "86346", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '86346'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "86346" within quotes. So the extracted text here is "86346".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "86346". According to the instructions, word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words. The ground truth has one unique word: "86346". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same. 

Now, checking the other considerations: capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output's text is all lowercase numbers, same as the ground truth. There's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about here. Also, there are no typos since both are identical.

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. That means the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or missing words. Even if there were typos, the instruction says small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there are none. Therefore, the answer is category 1.
