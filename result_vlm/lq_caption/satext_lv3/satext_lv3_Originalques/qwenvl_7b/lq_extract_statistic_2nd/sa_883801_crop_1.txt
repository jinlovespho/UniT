gt_text: MIRA EKONOMI
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "VIVA".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MIRA EKONOMI" and the OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'VIVA'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text reads "VIVA". So the extracted text is "VIVA".

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two words: "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output has "VIVA", which is a single word. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we look at unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth words are "MIRA" and "EKONOMI". The OCR output has "VIVA". 

Check if any of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. "VIVA" doesn't match "MIRA" or "EKONOMI". Even with typos, "VIVA" isn't close enough to either. So, there are no matches. 

Since none of the unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect.
