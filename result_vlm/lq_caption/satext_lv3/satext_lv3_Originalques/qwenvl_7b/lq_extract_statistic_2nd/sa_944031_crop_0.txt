gt_text: 105
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "105"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "105" and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the number 105. So the extracted text would be "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'". But I need to focus on the actual text that's being compared. Wait, the instruction says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is the entire sentence, but maybe the actual extracted text is just the part that's the OCR result. Wait, the example given in the problem says the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'". So the OCR output is that entire sentence, but the actual OCR result is the number 105. Hmm, maybe the user wants to extract the OCR'd text from the output. But the way the problem is structured, the ground truth is "105" and the OCR output is the sentence that includes "105". So the extracted text from the OCR output would be "105", right? Because the OCR output is the text that was extracted from the image. Wait, but the OCR output here is a sentence that says the OCR text is "105". That's a bit confusing. Maybe the OCR output is the actual text recognized, which in this case is "105", and the rest is just a description. But the problem says the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'". So maybe the entire sentence is the OCR output. But that seems odd. Wait, maybe the OCR output is the text that was extracted from the image, which is "105", and the rest is just a meta description. But the way the problem is presented, the VLM OCR output is the sentence that includes the number. So perhaps the extracted text is the entire sentence, but the ground truth is "105". But the instructions say to compare the extracted text with the ground truth. So if the extracted text is "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'", then the comparison would be between that and the ground truth "105". But that seems like the OCR output is a sentence, not just the number. However, maybe the user intended that the OCR output is the actual text recognized, which is "105", and the rest is just part of the output message. But the problem states that the VLM OCR output is exactly that sentence. So maybe the extracted text is the entire sentence, and the ground truth is "105". But that would make the comparison between "The OCR text in the image reads: '105'" and "105". However, the instructions for Step 2 say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "105", which is a single word. The OCR output's extracted text has words like "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads", "105". So the unique words in the ground truth are just "105". The OCR output includes "105" as a word. So the set of unique words in the ground truth is {"105"}, and the OCR output has "105" in it. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "105") are present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, that would be category 1. But wait, the OCR output has "105" as a word. The ground truth is "105", which is the same. So even though the OCR output has more words, the unique words in the ground truth are all present. So the answer is 1.
