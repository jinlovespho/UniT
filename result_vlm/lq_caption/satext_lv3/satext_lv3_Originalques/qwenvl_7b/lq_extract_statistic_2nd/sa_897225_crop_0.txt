Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "Murray Murray". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output's text is "1234567890". The ground truth has "Murray Murray".

Now, step 2 is to compare. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But the unique words in the ground truth are just "Murray" (since it's repeated). The OCR output has "1234567890", which is a string of numbers. 

So, the unique words in the ground truth are "Murray", but the OCR output has no words that match that. Even if we ignore case, punctuation, etc., the OCR output is numbers, not the word "Murray". There's no mention of "Murray" in the OCR text. 

So according to the categories: category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is numbers and the ground truth is the name "Murray", there's no match. So the answer should be 3.
