gt_text: QUE Lynch Merrill
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "THE HOTEL AT THE PARK"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "QUE Lynch Merrill" and the VLM OCR output is "THE HOTEL AT THE PARK". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3).

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output is "THE HOTEL AT THE PARK". So the extracted text is that exact string.

Next, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, only the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth words are "QUE", "Lynch", "Merrill". Let's process them. The OCR output words are "THE", "HOTEL", "AT", "THE", "PARK". But since we're considering unique words, the OCR output has "THE", "HOTEL", "AT", "PARK".

Now, comparing the unique words from ground truth ("QUE", "Lynch", "Merrill") with the OCR's unique words. Let's check for matches. 

First, "QUE" – does it appear in the OCR output? The OCR output has "THE", "HOTEL", "AT", "PARK". No "QUE" here. Then "Lynch" – not present. "Merrill" – also not present. So none of the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output.

Wait, but the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has three unique words. The OCR output has four unique words, but none of them are in the ground truth. So according to the categories, if none of the words match, it's category 3. But wait, the instructions say "Small typos still count as matches." But in this case, there are no typos, just no matches. So even if there were a typo, like "Merrill" vs "Merril", but here it's completely different words.

Therefore, the answer would be category 3, because none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The OCR output is "THE HOTEL AT THE PARK" which has no overlap with "QUE", "Lynch", "Merrill". So category 3 is Incorrect.
