gt_text: FURUNO
vlm_output: The image appears to be a close-up of a water tower and some utility poles against a blue sky. There is no text in the image, so there is nothing to OCR.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "FURUNO", and the VLM OCR output says there's no text in the image. 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that there's no text in the image, so the extracted text would be empty or just the statement about no text.

Next, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the word "FURUNO". The OCR output doesn't mention any text at all. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique words from the ground truth to be present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output says there's no text, it doesn't include "FURUNO". So, there's no match here. 

Category 2 is for partial matches, but since there are no words in the OCR output, there's nothing to partially match. 

Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated/empty. The OCR output is stating that there's no text, which is unrelated to the ground truth text "FURUNO". Therefore, this falls under Category 3.
