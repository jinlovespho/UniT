gt_text: 100%

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "100%", and the VLM OCR output is also "100%". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output here is "100%", which is the same as the ground truth. 

Now for Step 2, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both texts are exactly the same. The unique words in the ground truth are just "100%", and the OCR output has the same. 

They also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, here there are no differences in capitalization or spacing. The punctuation is the same percentage sign. 

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output is exactly correct. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has exactly the same word as the ground truth, it should be Category 1. 

No issues here. The answer should be 1.
