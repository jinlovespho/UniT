gt_text: EXPRESS
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: 'P EXPRESS'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "EXPRESS", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: 'P EXPRESS'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "'P EXPRESS'". So the actual text here is "P EXPRESS". 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "EXPRESS". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we can ignore the order. Also, we should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "EXPRESS".

Now, checking the OCR output: "P EXPRESS". The word here is "P" and "EXPRESS". The ground truth is "EXPRESS", which is present in the OCR output. However, there's an extra "P" at the beginning. But according to the guidelines, we should ignore extra spaces and small typos. Wait, the "P" is an extra word. But the ground truth only has "EXPRESS". The OCR output includes "EXPRESS" as one of the words. So even though there's an extra "P", the main word "EXPRESS" is there. 

The categories are: 
1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos).
2 if at least one but not all.
3 if none or unrelated.

Since the OCR output contains "EXPRESS" (even with an extra "P"), and the ground truth is only "EXPRESS", that's a full match. The presence of an extra word ("P") doesn't disqualify it because the instruction says to ignore extra spaces and small typos. Wait, but "P" is a separate word. However, the ground truth only has "EXPRESS" as the unique word. The OCR output includes "EXPRESS", so all unique ground truth words are present. Therefore, category 1 applies.
