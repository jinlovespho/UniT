gt_text: 060630
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '060630'

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "060630". The VLM OCR output says, "The OCR text in the image reads: '060630'". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the OCR output is the string '060630' enclosed in quotes. But the actual text content here is just the digits '060630'. The rest is just the description of the OCR result.

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is '060630', and the OCR output is the same. Now, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth here is a single string of numbers. So the unique words would just be '060630' as a single word. 

But the OCR output's extracted text is also '060630', which is the same as the ground truth. So all unique ground truth words (which is one word) are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some, 3 if none. Since they are exactly the same, even though the OCR output includes the quote marks, the extracted text is '060630', which matches the ground truth. So category 1 is correct.
