gt_text: 1933
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "1986".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "1933" and the VLM OCR output says "The OCR text in the image is '1986'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text it's trying to capture is the number "1986" inside quotes. So the extracted text would be "1986".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth "1933". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single numbers, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "1933". The OCR output has "1986". 

Now, checking if they match. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches. However, "1933" vs "1986" – the difference here is more than a small typo. The first two digits are the same (1 and 9), but the third digit is 3 vs 8, and the fourth is 3 vs 6. That's two digits different. Depending on how strict "small typos" are, but in this case, since the entire number is incorrect, it's not a small typo. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match (which they don't here), 2 if at least one but not all match (but there's only one unique word in the ground truth, so if it's not present, it's not partial). Wait, the ground truth has only one unique word, "1933". The OCR output has "1986", which is a different number. So there are no matches. Therefore, according to category 3, which is "Incorrect: no words match..." So the answer should be 3.
