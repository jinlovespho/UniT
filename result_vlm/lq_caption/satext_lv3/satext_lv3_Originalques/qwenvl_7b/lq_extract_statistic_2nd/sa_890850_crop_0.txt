gt_text: OUTBACK SUPER-LITE
vlm_output: OUTBACK

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "OUTBACK SUPER-LITE" and the VLM OCR output is "OUTBACK". So, the task is to compare these two based on the given steps.

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "OUTBACK". Then compare it to the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. The ground truth has two words: "OUTBACK" and "SUPER-LITE". The OCR output only has "OUTBACK". 

Now, checking the categories. Category 1 is if all unique ground truth words are present. But the OCR output is missing "SUPER-LITE". So that's not category 1. Category 2 is if at least one but not all words match. Here, "OUTBACK" is present, but "SUPER-LITE" isn't. So that would be category 2. Category 3 is if none match or it's unrelated. Since "OUTBACK" does match, it's not category 3.

Wait, but the instructions mention comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has one. So, only one of the two words is present. Therefore, it's partially correct, which is category 2. Also, the typos part says small typos still count as matches, but there's no typo here. Just missing a word. So yes, category 2.
