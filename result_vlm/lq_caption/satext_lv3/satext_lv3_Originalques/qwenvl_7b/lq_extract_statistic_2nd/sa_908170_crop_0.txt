gt_text: ROZA
vlm_output: The image contains the following text:  ``` 100 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROZA". The VLM OCR output says "The image contains the following text:  ``` 100 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100" inside backticks. So the extracted text is "100".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "ROZA". The unique words in the ground truth are just "ROZA". The OCR output has "100". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. However, "ROZA" is a word, and the OCR output has "100", which is a number. There's no overlap in the words. 

Also, considering typos, but "100" isn't a typo of "ROZA". They are completely different. So, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Therefore, according to the categories, this would be category 3 because no words match and the output is unrelated.
