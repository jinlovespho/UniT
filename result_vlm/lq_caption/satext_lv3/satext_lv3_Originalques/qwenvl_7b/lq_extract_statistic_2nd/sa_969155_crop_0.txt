gt_text: OFFICE POST
vlm_output: POST OFFICE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OFFICE POST" and the VLM OCR output is "POST OFFICE". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "POST OFFICE", which is straightforward. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. So even though the order is reversed, that shouldn't affect the comparison. 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "OFFICE" and "POST". The OCR output has "POST" and "OFFICE". So both words are present. The instructions mention ignoring capitalization, which is already handled here since both are uppercase. Also, there's no punctuation or extra spaces to worry about. 

Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos in this case. Both words are exactly the same. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct. 

I don't see any missing words or extra words. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth. So the answer is category 1.
