gt_text: SWITCH NINTENDO
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Nintendo Switch".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SWITCH NINTENDO" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Nintendo Switch'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "Nintendo Switch" as the text in the image. So the extracted text here is "Nintendo Switch".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth words are "SWITCH" and "NINTENDO". The OCR output has "Nintendo" and "Switch". 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, so "Nintendo Switch" versus "Switch Nintendo" would still be the same. Also, ignoring capitalization, so "Nintendo" and "nintendo" are the same. The same applies to "Switch" and "switch". 

Looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "SWITCH" and "NINTENDO". The OCR output has "Nintendo" (which matches "NINTENDO") and "Switch" (which matches "SWITCH"). Even though the order is reversed, it's still both words present. Also, there are no typos here; the words are correctly spelled but with different capitalization. 

Since both unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, even with different order and case, the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no missing words or extra words, and the typos aren't an issue here. So the answer is 1.
