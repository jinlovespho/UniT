gt_text: LAMBORGHINI
vlm_output: LAMBORGHINI

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "LAMBORGHINI" and the VLM OCR output is also "LAMBORGHINI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth, the extracted text is "LAMBORGHINI".

Next, I compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But here, the words are the same. 

The ground truth has only one unique word: "LAMBORGHINI". The OCR output also has the same word. So all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

The comparison also considers ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. In this case, both are all caps and have no spaces or punctuation, so they match exactly. Small typos are considered matches, but there are no typos here.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
