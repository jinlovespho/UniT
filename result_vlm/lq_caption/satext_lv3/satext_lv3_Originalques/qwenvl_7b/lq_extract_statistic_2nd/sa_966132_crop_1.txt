gt_text: MIRAI
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100% 100% 100%"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "MIRAI" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  "100% 100% 100%"".

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image reads:  "100% 100% 100%"". So the actual text content here is "100% 100% 100%". The rest is just the description of what the OCR is saying, but the main text is the three "100%"s.

Now, Step 2 is comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MIRAI", which is a single word. The OCR output has "100%" repeated three times. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MIRAI". The OCR output has "100%" as the only unique word. 

Now, considering the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, and small typos. However, the OCR output has "100%" which is a number with a percentage sign, and the ground truth is "MIRAI", which is a proper noun, probably a name or a term. 

Since there's no overlap in the unique words between the OCR output and the ground truth, even when considering possible typos or ignoring punctuation, "100%" doesn't resemble "MIRAI" in any way. There's no match here. 

So, according to the categories: if none of the unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output, it's category 3. The OCR output has "100%" which is unrelated to "MIRAI". Therefore, the answer should be 3.
