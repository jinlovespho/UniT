gt_text: OX
vlm_output: The image contains the following text: "O X"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "OX", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the following text: "O X"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the image contains "O X". So the extracted text here is "O X".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "OX". The instructions say word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The ground truth has two characters: 'O' and 'X'. The OCR output has "O X", which are the same letters but with a space in between. The problem mentions ignoring extra/missing spaces, so the space shouldn't matter. Also, capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase here. Typos are considered matches if they're small, but in this case, there's no typo—just a space added. 

The unique words in the ground truth are "OX" (as a single word), but the OCR output has "O" and "X" as separate words. Wait, does the OCR output's "O X" count as two words or one? The ground truth is "OX" as a single word. However, the comparison instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "OX"—is that considered one word or two letters? The problem says "unique words in the ground truth". If the ground truth is "OX" as a single word, then the OCR output has "O X" as two words. But the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "OX". The OCR output has two words: "O" and "X". But the OCR output's words are "O" and "X", which are parts of the ground truth word. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the ground truth is "OX" as a single word, then the OCR output must have that same word. But the OCR output has "O X" which is split. But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output's "O X" is considered as "OX" when spaces are ignored. 

Wait, the problem says: "Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the ground truth has the word "OX" (assuming it's a single word). The OCR output's text is "O X", which when spaces are ignored becomes "OX". So the OCR output contains the same characters as the ground truth, just with a space. Since the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, this should be considered a match. Therefore, the unique words in the ground truth (which is "OX") are present in the OCR output (as "O X" becomes "OX" when spaces are removed). Therefore, all unique ground truth words are present, so category 1.

But wait, another angle: if the ground truth is "OX" as a single word, and the OCR output is "O X" as two words, but the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"OX"}, and the OCR output's words are {"O", "X"}. But "O" and "X" are not the same as "OX". However, the problem says to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the OCR output's "O X" is considered as "OX" when spaces are removed, thus matching the ground truth. Therefore, the set of unique words in the OCR output would include "OX" if we consider that the space is ignored. But the OCR output's text is "O X", which when spaces are ignored is "OX". However, the OCR output's extracted text is "O X", not "OX". But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So maybe the comparison is done by normalizing the OCR output text by removing spaces, then checking if the ground truth is a subset. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's text is considered as "O X", which is two words. The ground truth is "OX" as one word. If the comparison is based on the set of unique words, then the OCR output's words are {"O", "X"}, and the ground truth's words are {"OX"}. Since "O" and "X" are not the same as "OX", but the problem says to consider small typos as matches. However, splitting "OX" into "O X" is not a typo but a space addition. But the instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces. So perhaps the OCR output's "O X" is considered equivalent to "OX", meaning that the OCR output contains the same characters as the ground truth, just with a space. Therefore, the unique words in the ground truth (which is "OX") are present in the OCR output when normalized. Therefore, category 1.

But I'm a bit confused. If the ground truth is a single word "OX", and the OCR output splits it into two words "O X", but when spaces are ignored, it's the same. So the OCR output's text, when normalized (removing spaces), is "OX", which matches the ground truth. Therefore, the unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output. So the answer is 1.
