gt_text: Santander Santander
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100% Natural"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Santander Santander". So the unique words here are just "Santander", right? Because it's repeated, but we only consider unique words.

Now, the VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  "100% Natural"". The extracted text content from that would be "The text in the image reads:  100% Natural". Let me make sure I extract only the text part. The OCR output is a statement about what the image reads, so the actual text in the image is "100% Natural".

So the extracted text is "100% Natural". Now, comparing that to the ground truth's unique words, which is "Santander". The OCR output has words like "100%", "Natural", "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads". None of these words are "Santander" or any variation of it. Even if we ignore capitalization, "Santander" isn't present. The OCR output is completely different. So there are no matches for the unique ground truth word.

Therefore, according to the categories, since no words match, it's category 3: Incorrect.
