gt_text: Kikita
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "10"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Kikita" and the OCR output is "10". So first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "10". Then compare that with the ground truth.

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Kikita". The OCR output has "10", which is a number. Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word each. Ignore capitalization, but "Kikita" is a name, and the OCR has numbers. Also, small typos count as matches, but here it's not a typo—it's completely different. 

So the OCR output has no words that match the ground truth. The category is 3 if no words match. Since "10" isn't related to "Kikita" at all, even considering typos, it's not a match. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
