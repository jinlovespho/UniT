gt_text: HOTEL
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "PISA"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOTEL" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: 'PISA'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads: 'PISA'". So the actual extracted text here would be "PISA". 

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "HOTEL". The unique words in the ground truth are just "HOTEL". The OCR output has "PISA". 

Looking at the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word, "HOTEL". The OCR output's text is "PISA", which is a different word. 

Ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase here. No typos in "PISA" compared to "HOTEL" since they are entirely different words. So there's no match for the unique ground truth word. 

Therefore, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, it would fall under category 3 — Incorrect.
