gt_text: 40 40
vlm_output: The number in the image is "40".

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40 40". The VLM OCR output is "The number in the image is "40".".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is "The number in the image is "40".".

Now, step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "40" and "40" again, but since we're considering unique words, it's just "40". The OCR output has the word "40" in it. 

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the OCR output has other words, as long as the unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth's unique words are {"40"}. The OCR output has "40" in it. So all unique ground truth words are present. 

Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra spaces. The OCR output has "40" correctly. The other words like "The", "number", etc., are irrelevant here. Since the ground truth only has "40", and the OCR output includes that, it should be category 1. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there's no typo here. So the answer is 1.
