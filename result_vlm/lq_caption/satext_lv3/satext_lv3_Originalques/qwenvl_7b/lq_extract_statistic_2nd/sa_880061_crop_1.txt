gt_text: garlando alfonso
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "alfonso garlando".

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "garlando alfonso". The OCR output from the VLM is "The text in the image reads 'alfonso garlando'."

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The actual text here is "alfonso garlando". The original ground truth is "garlando alfonso". 

Now, comparing the two. The words are "alfonso" and "garlando" in both cases. The order is reversed, but the problem says word order doesn't matter. Also, we should ignore capitalization, which isn't an issue here since both are lowercase. There are no typos mentioned, just the order. The set of unique words in the ground truth is {"garlando", "alfonso"}, and the OCR output has the same words. So all unique words are present, just in reverse order. According to the categories, that's a correct match, so category 1.
