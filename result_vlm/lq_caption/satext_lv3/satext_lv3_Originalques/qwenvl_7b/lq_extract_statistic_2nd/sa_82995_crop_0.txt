gt_text: AGAINST STAINS POWER 2X
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS"

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to compare the OCR output with the ground truth text based on specific criteria. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the ground truth text is "AGAINST STAINS POWER 2X". The VLM OCR output is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". The steps mentioned are to extract the text from the OCR output and then compare it with the ground truth, considering certain factors.

So Step 1 is straightforward: extract the text from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". I need to process this text for comparison.

Now Step 2 is the comparison. The criteria are that word order doesn't matter, we only compare unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. Also, the categories are based on whether all, some, or none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output.

First, I need to identify the unique words in the ground truth. Let's split the ground truth text into words. The original is "AGAINST STAINS POWER 2X". Splitting by spaces, the words are: AGAINST, STAINS, POWER, 2X. So four unique words.

Now the OCR output is "2X POWER AGAINST STAINS". Splitting that, the words are 2X, POWER, AGAINST, STAINS. Same four words. Now, considering the comparison rules: ignore order, case, spacing, etc. Let's check each word.

The ground truth words are AGAINST, STAINS, POWER, 2X. The OCR output has all these words. Let's check each one:

- AGAINST: present in OCR as "AGAINST" (same case, but case is ignored, so it's a match).
- STAINS: same as in OCR.
- POWER: same.
- 2X: same.

No typos here. All words are present. Since all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, even though the order is different, the category should be 1 — Correct.

Wait, but the user mentioned that small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. The OCR output has exactly the same words as the ground truth, just in a different order. Since word order doesn't matter, this should be a correct match. So category 1.

LLM classification result: 1
1. Correct Num: 7
2. Slightly Correct Num: 1
3. Incorrect Num: 7
