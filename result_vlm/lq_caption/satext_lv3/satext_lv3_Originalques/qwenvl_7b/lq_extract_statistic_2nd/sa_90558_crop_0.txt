gt_text: 058 DB 445
vlm_output: The image contains the following text: "DB"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "058 DB 445". The VLM OCR output is "The image contains the following text: "DB"".

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "DB" is the text. So the extracted text is "DB".

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth has three parts: "058", "DB", "445". But the OCR only found "DB". 

Now, according to the rules: word order doesn't matter. We compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has three unique words: "058", "DB", "445". The OCR output has only "DB". 

So, the OCR matched one out of the three unique words. The categories are: 1 if all match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none or mostly wrong. Since one word matches, that's category 2. Even though the OCR missed the other two numbers, but the rules say that if at least one matches, it's partially correct. So the answer should be 2.
