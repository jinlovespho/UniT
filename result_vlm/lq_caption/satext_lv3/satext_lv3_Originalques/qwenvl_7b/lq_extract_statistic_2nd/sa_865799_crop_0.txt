gt_text: EY
vlm_output: The text in the image is "EY".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EY". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is 'EY'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text in the image is "EY". So the extracted text here is "EY".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth is "EY". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same. 

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one word: "EY". The OCR output's extracted text is "EY", which is the same. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Also, considering that word order doesn't matter, but here there's only one word. Capitalization and spacing are ignored, but "EY" is already matching in case. There are no typos here. So it should be category 1, correct. 

I don't see any other words in the OCR output that aren't in the ground truth. The rest of the OCR text is "The text in the image is", which are not part of the ground truth, but the task is to compare based on the unique words in the ground truth. So the key is that the OCR output contains "EY", which is the ground truth. Therefore, category 1.
