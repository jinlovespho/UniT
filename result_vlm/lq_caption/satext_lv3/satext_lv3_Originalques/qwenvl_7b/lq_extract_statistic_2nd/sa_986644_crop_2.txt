gt_text: FRUIT
vlm_output: FRUIT

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The ground truth text is "FRUIT" and the VLM OCR output is also "FRUIT". The steps say to first extract the text from the OCR output, which is straightforward here since it's just "FRUIT". 

Next, compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are exactly the same word.

The comparison needs to consider unique words from the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "FRUIT". The OCR output also has "FRUIT". Since they are the same, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The rules also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation, so that's not an issue. Also, typos are considered matches if they're small, but there are no typos here.

So, according to the categories, since all unique words match, it should be category 1. There's no partial match or any issues. The answer is 1.
