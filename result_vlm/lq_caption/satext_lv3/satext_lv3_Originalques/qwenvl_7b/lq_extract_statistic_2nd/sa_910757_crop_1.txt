gt_text: 1057
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "1057".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "1057" and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is '1057'." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is the sentence "The OCR text in the image is '1057'." So the extracted text would be all the words in that sentence. But wait, the ground truth is just the number "1057". 

Now, moving to Step 2, which is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But the ground truth here is "1057", which is a single number. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "1057". 

The OCR output has words like "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", and then "1057". So the extracted text from the OCR includes "1057" as one of the words. 

Now, the comparison: the unique words in the ground truth are {"1057"}, and the OCR output contains "1057" as a word. Even though there are other words in the OCR output, the key is whether the unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "1057" is present, that should count. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none. Since the ground truth has only one unique word, and the OCR output includes that word, it should be category 1. 

Wait, but maybe I need to check if the OCR output's text is considered. The ground truth is "1057", and the OCR output's text includes "1057" as part of the sentence. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is just "1057", and the OCR output has that exact word, even with other words around it, the match is there. 

So the answer should be category 1. I don't see any typos here. The OCR output correctly includes "1057" as a word. The other words in the OCR output are irrelevant because the ground truth only has "1057". Therefore, all unique words in the ground truth are present in the OCR output, so category 1 is correct.
