vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "STOP". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "1234567890". So the extracted text is just the numbers 1 through 0.

Now, comparing that with the ground truth "STOP". The unique words in the ground truth are just "STOP". The OCR output has numbers, not any letters. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "STOP" is a word with letters and the OCR output has numbers, there's no overlap. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (ignoring case, spacing, etc.), 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match. Here, the OCR output has no letters, so "STOP" isn't present. Therefore, it's category 3.
