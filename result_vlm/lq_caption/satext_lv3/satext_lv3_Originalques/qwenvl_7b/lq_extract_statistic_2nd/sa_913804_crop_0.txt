gt_text: GOVERNO DEL AZZO PAL PALAZZO
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. They want me to categorize the OCR output into one of three categories based on specific criteria. 

First, the ground truth is "GOVERNO DEL AZZO PAL PALAZZO". The OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is a string of numbers: "1234567890". There's no actual text related to the ground truth here. 

Now, moving to Step 2: Comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Also, small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth words are: GOVERNO, DEL, AZZO, PAL, PALAZZO. Let's break them down. The OCR output is numbers, which are not words. Since the OCR output has no words that match any of the ground truth words, even considering typos, there's no overlap. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present (which they aren't here), 2 if at least one matches (but none do), and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output is entirely numbers and none of the words from the ground truth are present, it falls under category 3. 

I need to make sure I didn't miss any possible typos. For example, if the OCR had "governo" or "palazzo" but it's numbers. No, there's no letters here. So definitely category 3.
