gt_text: DIDZIOJI 17
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DIDZIOJI 17". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```". 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has a lot of text, but the actual extracted text here is "1234567890". The rest is probably just the description of the OCR result. So the main extracted text is the numbers 1234567890.

Now step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "DIDZIOJI" and "17". Let's break it down. The OCR output has numbers 1-10, but the ground truth has "17" and a word "DIDZIOJI".

The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words here are "DIDZIOJI" and "17". The OCR output's extracted text is "1234567890", which is numbers 1 through 10. 

Now, considering the rules: word order doesn't matter, ignore case, punctuation, spacing, typos. But the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. "DIDZIOJI" is a word that's not present in the OCR output. The number "17" isn't in the OCR output either. The OCR has numbers 1-10, but "17" is not there. 

So the unique words in the ground truth are "DIDZIOJI" and "17". The OCR output doesn't have either of these. Therefore, no matches. According to the categories, that's category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated or empty. Even though the OCR output has numbers, they don't match the ground truth's words or numbers. So the answer should be 3.
