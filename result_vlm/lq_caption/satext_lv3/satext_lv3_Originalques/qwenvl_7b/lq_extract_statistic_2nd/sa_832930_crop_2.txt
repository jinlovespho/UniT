gt_text: Victoria Station
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Victoria Station".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria Station" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Victoria Station'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the phrase "Victoria Station" within quotes. So the extracted text here would be "Victoria Station" because that's the actual text mentioned.

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is exactly "Victoria Station". Now, looking at the comparison criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter. Since both have the same two words, order isn't an issue here.
- Unique words in ground truth: "Victoria" and "Station". The OCR output has both of these words exactly as they appear in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization: Both are capitalized, but even if they weren't, the comparison would still match.
- Punctuation and spaces: The OCR output has quotes and other words, but the extracted text is just "Victoria Station", so no issues there.
- Typos: There are no typos in the OCR output's extracted text.

Since all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, and considering the criteria, this should fall under category 1 — Correct. There's no missing words, and the OCR output correctly identifies both words. Even if there were minor typos, like "Vicoria" or "Staion", the problem states small typos still count as matches. But in this case, there are no typos. So the answer is definitely category 1.
