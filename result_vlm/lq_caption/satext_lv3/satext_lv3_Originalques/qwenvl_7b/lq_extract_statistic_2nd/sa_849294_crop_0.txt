gt_text: MOTOR VEHICLE CRUISING NO AHEAD 14-140 Sec C.O. per
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "Please do not block the crosswalk."

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and assign a category (1, 2, or 3) based on how well the OCR output matches the ground truth.

Let me start by recalling the ground truth text: "MOTOR VEHICLE CRUISING NO AHEAD 14-140 Sec C.O. per". The OCR output is: "The text in the image reads:  'Please do not block the crosswalk.'" 

The steps are to extract the text from the OCR output and compare it with the ground truth. The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, and small typos are still considered matches. The categories are based on whether all, some, or none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output.

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that says the text in the image reads "Please do not block the crosswalk." So the extracted text is "Please do not block the crosswalk."

Next, I need to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has several words: MOTOR, VEHICLE, CRUISING, NO, AHEAD, 14-140, Sec, C.O., per. Let me list them all as unique words. Wait, the ground truth is "MOTOR VEHICLE CRUISING NO AHEAD 14-140 Sec C.O. per". Breaking it down into individual words (ignoring spaces and considering hyphens and periods as part of the word?), but the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words here would be: MOTOR, VEHICLE, CRUISING, NO, AHEAD, 14-140, Sec, C.O., per. Are these all considered separate words? For example, "14-140" is a single word with a hyphen, "Sec" is an abbreviation, "C.O." is another abbreviation with a period. So those are all unique words.

Now, the OCR output is "Please do not block the crosswalk." Let's break that down into words: Please, do, not, block, the, crosswalk. Are there any words here that match any of the ground truth words? Let's check each word in the OCR output against the ground truth words.

Looking at "Please" – not in ground truth. "Do" – no. "Not" – no. "Block" – no. "The" – no. "Crosswalk" – no. None of these words are present in the ground truth. The ground truth words are all related to traffic signs or instructions, like "MOTOR VEHICLE", "CRUISING", "NO AHEAD", "14-140 Sec", etc. The OCR output is about not blocking a crosswalk, which is a different context entirely.

But wait, the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if any of the OCR words match any of the ground truth words. Let me check again. The ground truth words are MOTOR, VEHICLE, CRUISING, NO, AHEAD, 14-140, Sec, C.O., per. The OCR words are Please, do, not, block, the, crosswalk. None of these are the same. Even if we consider case-insensitive, like "no" vs "No" in the OCR output, but "no" isn't present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "not" which is different from "NO" in the ground truth. So no matches at all.

Therefore, according to the categories, if none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output, it would be category 3: Incorrect. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth text, as it's about a crosswalk instead of a traffic sign related to vehicles cruising ahead with a time limit.
