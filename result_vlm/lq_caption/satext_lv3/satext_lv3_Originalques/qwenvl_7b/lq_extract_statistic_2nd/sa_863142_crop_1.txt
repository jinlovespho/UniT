gt_text: 214
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "214".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "214". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is "214".".

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The OCR text in the image is "214"." So the actual text here is "The OCR text in the image is 214". But I need to extract the text content. Wait, the OCR output is the text that the model read from the image. So the OCR output here is the sentence "The OCR text in the image is "214"." But the user says that the VLM OCR output is that sentence. Wait, maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text extracted from the image, but in this case, the OCR output is the sentence that the model generated, which includes the actual text "214" as part of the sentence.

So the user's instruction says: Step 1 is to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is "214"." So the text content here is "The OCR text in the image is 214". But the ground truth is "214". Now, the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is just "214", which is a single word. The OCR output's text includes the word "214" as part of the sentence. So the unique words in the ground truth are {"214"}.

Now, checking if the OCR output contains "214" as a word. The OCR output's text is "The OCR text in the image is 214". The word "214" is present here. So the unique words in the OCR output are {"The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "214"}. But the ground truth's unique words are {"214"}. So all unique ground truth words (just "214") are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the criteria, this would be category 1: Correct. Because the OCR output contains the unique ground truth word "214".

Wait, but the instructions say to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth is "214", which is a single word. The OCR output has that word. So all unique words from ground truth are present. So category 1.
