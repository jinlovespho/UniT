gt_text: HOTEL HOTEL
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "HOTEL".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "HOTEL HOTEL", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'HOTEL'." 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the word "HOTEL" once. So the extracted text is just "HOTEL".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "HOTEL" and "HOTEL" again, but since we're considering unique words, it's just "HOTEL". 

The comparison rules mention that word order doesn't matter, so we don't have to check the sequence. Also, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "HOTEL". The OCR output has "HOTEL" once. 

Now, checking the rules: ignore capitalization (both are uppercase here), punctuation (there's none in the extracted text except the quotes, which are probably ignored), and extra/missing spaces. The OCR output has "HOTEL" once, and the ground truth has "HOTEL" twice, but since we're looking at unique words, that's still just "HOTEL".

Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. The OCR output correctly has "HOTEL" which matches the ground truth's "HOTEL".

So, since all unique words in the ground truth (which is just "HOTEL") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
