gt_text: KVADRO TOUR
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "ALI ALI"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KVADRO TOUR". The OCR output from the VLM is "ALI ALI". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is "ALI ALI". Then, compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are "KVADRO" and "TOUR". The OCR output has "ALI" repeated twice. 

Now, checking if any of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. "KVADRO" and "TOUR" aren't in "ALI ALI". The OCR output has "ALI" which isn't in the ground truth. Since none of the unique ground truth words are present, even considering typos, case, spacing, etc., but "ALI" doesn't match either "KVADRO" or "TOUR". So there's no match. 

Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
