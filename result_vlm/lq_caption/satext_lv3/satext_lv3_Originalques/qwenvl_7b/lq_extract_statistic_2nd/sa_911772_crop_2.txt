gt_text: SHACK
vlm_output: SHACK

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "SHACK" and the VLM OCR output is also "SHACK". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "SHACK", so that's straightforward. The extracted text is "SHACK".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "SHACK". The comparison criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter. But since there's only one word here, order isn't an issue.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "SHACK".
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps and no spaces, so that's the same.
- Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are exactly the same.

Now, looking at the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since both are "SHACK", the OCR output has all the unique words (just one) from the ground truth. So this should be category 1.

I don't see any issues here. The output matches exactly, so it's a correct match. No need to consider partial or incorrect categories. The answer should be 1.
