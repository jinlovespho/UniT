gt_text: DELTA CONNECTION DELTA
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Delta".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "DELTA CONNECTION DELTA", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Delta'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads 'Delta'." So the actual extracted text here is "Delta". But I need to consider the entire OCR output, but maybe the relevant part is just the word "Delta".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "DELTA" and "CONNECTION". Wait, the ground truth is "DELTA CONNECTION DELTA", so the unique words are "DELTA" and "CONNECTION". But the OCR output only mentions "Delta" once. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we look at the set of unique words. So the ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has "Delta" (which is "DELTA" with lowercase, but we ignore capitalization). So "Delta" matches "DELTA". However, the ground truth also has "CONNECTION", which is not present in the OCR output. 

So the OCR output has one of the two unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories: if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. Since "CONNECTION" is missing, it's not a full match. Therefore, the answer should be 2. But wait, the OCR output only mentions "Delta" once, but the ground truth has "DELTA" twice. However, the comparison is based on unique words, so duplicates don't matter. The key is that the OCR output has "Delta" (matching "DELTA") but misses "CONNECTION". So category 2 applies here.
