Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user provided a ground truth text and an OCR output from a VLM. They want me to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and categorize the result into 1, 2, or 3.

So, the ground truth is "911 Porschestraße Ing. Dr. Porsche h.c. Aktiengesellschaft Entwicklungszentrum F. STUTTGART". The OCR output is "Kreisverwaltung Landkreis Hildesheim". 

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "Kreisverwaltung Landkreis Hildesheim".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The criteria are:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The categories are:
1: All unique ground truth words are present in OCR output.
2: At least one but not all unique words match.
3: No words match or output is wrong/unrelated/empty.

First, I need to list the unique words in the ground truth. Let's break down the ground truth text into words. The original text is: "911 Porschestraße Ing. Dr. Porsche h.c. Aktiengesellschaft Entwicklungszentrum F. STUTTGART".

Breaking it down into words (assuming spaces separate them, even if there are periods or other punctuation):

- 911
- Porschestraße
- Ing.
- Dr.
- Porsche
- h.c.
- Aktiengesellschaft
- Entwicklungszentrum
- F.
- STUTTGART

But wait, "Ing. Dr. Porsche h.c." might be considered as "Ing.", "Dr.", "Porsche", "h.c." as separate words. Similarly, "F. STUTTGART" would be "F." and "STUTTGART".

So the unique words in the ground truth are: 911, Porschestraße, Ing., Dr., Porsche, h.c., Aktiengesellschaft, Entwicklungszentrum, F., STUTTGART.

Now, the OCR output is "Kreisverwaltung Landkreis Hildesheim". Let's split that into words: Kreisverwaltung, Landkreis, Hildesheim.

Now, comparing each of these words against the ground truth's unique words. Let's check if any of the OCR words are present in the ground truth's list.

Looking at the OCR words:

- Kreisverwaltung: Not in the ground truth list.
- Landkreis: Not in the ground truth list.
- Hildesheim: Not in the ground truth list.

So none of the OCR output words match any of the ground truth words. Even if we consider case insensitivity (like STUTTGART vs. stuttgart), but the OCR output words are completely different. There's no overlap.

Therefore, according to the criteria, since none of the unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output, the category would be 3. Even if there were a typo, but in this case, the words are entirely different. The OCR output is about a different entity (Kreisverwaltung Landkreis Hildesheim) versus the Porsche company details. So it's unrelated and no words match. Hence, category 3.
