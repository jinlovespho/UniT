gt_text: PILOTS
vlm_output: PILOTS

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "PILOTS" and the VLM OCR output is also "PILOTS". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward; the OCR output is "PILOTS".

Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the word "PILOTS". The OCR output is exactly the same. Let's check the criteria. Since both are the same, all unique words (which is just "PILOTS") are present. Even if there were typos, like "pilots" vs "PILOTS", it's considered a match because of the note about ignoring capitalization. But here, they are exactly the same. So according to category 1, which is correct when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. There's no missing words, no extra words, and the only word is present. So the category should be 1. There's no partial match here, so category 2 or 3 don't apply. Therefore, the answer is 1.
