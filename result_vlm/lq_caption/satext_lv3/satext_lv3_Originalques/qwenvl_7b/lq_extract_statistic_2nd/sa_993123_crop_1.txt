gt_text: HSBC
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "HSBC".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HSBC". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'HSBC'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the text "HSBC" within quotes. So the extracted text here would be "HSBC".

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "HSBC". The OCR output has exactly that word. Now, considering the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word here, that's not an issue. The set of unique words in the ground truth is {"HSBC"}. The OCR output also contains "HSBC", so all unique words match. Also, ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. No typos, extra spaces, or punctuation issues here. 

So according to the categories, since all unique ground truth words are present, it should be category 1. The answer is 1.
