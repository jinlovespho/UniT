gt_text: PEREYRA FLIA
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "1920"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "PEREYRA FLIA". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  "1920"".

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "The text in the image reads:  "1920"". So the actual extracted text would be "1920", right? Because the rest is just the description of the image, and the actual text content is "1920".

Now step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth words are "PEREYRA" and "FLIA". The OCR output has "1920", which is a number. 

Looking at the comparison criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are present. The ground truth has two unique words. The OCR output has "1920", which is a number, not a word. So none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

Also, considering that the OCR output is completely different in content. The numbers don't match the names. So according to the categories, category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since "1920" has no relation to "PEREYRA" or "FLIA", this would be category 3. Even if there were typos, but here the words are entirely different. So the answer should be 3.
