gt_text: 69
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` 12 ```

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "69", and the VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads: ``` 12 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output has some extra text like "The text in the image reads: " and then the code block with "12". So the actual extracted text would be "12" after removing the surrounding text and the code block markers. 

Now, comparing "12" with the ground truth "69". The unique words in the ground truth are just "69". The OCR output has "12". Since the words are different, there's no match. The problem says that even small typos count as matches, but "12" isn't a typo of "69"; they're entirely different numbers. Also, the categories mention that if no words match, it's category 3. So the answer should be 3.
