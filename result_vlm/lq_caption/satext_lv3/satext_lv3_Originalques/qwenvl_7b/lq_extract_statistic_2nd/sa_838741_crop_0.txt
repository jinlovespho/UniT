gt_text: INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE
vlm_output: The image appears to be a close-up of a building with a blue sky in the background. The text or details on the building are not clearly visible, so it's difficult to read any specific information from the image. If you have more context or a clearer image, please provide it for further assistance.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION SERVICE". So the unique words here are "INTERNATIONAL", "CORPORATION", and "SERVICE". I need to check if these words appear in the OCR output, considering the specified conditions.

Now, looking at the VLM OCR output: "The image appears to be a close-up of a building with a blue sky in the background. The text or details on the building are not clearly visible, so it's difficult to read any specific information from the image. If you have more context or a clearer image, please provide it for further assistance."

The OCR output doesn't mention any of the words from the ground truth. It talks about a building, blue sky, text not visible, etc. There's no mention of "international", "corporation", or "service" here. Even if I check for typos or variations, there's nothing that resembles those words. The OCR output is essentially saying that the text isn't visible, so it's not providing any extracted text. 

According to the categories: Category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Category 2 is if at least one matches. Category 3 is if none match or the output is wrong/unrelated. Since none of the words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, and the OCR output is not providing any text that could be related, this falls under Category 3.
