gt_text: HOLLYWOOD
vlm_output: HOLLYWOOD

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "HOLLYWOOD" and the VLM OCR output is also "HOLLYWOOD". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth. 

Step 2 involves comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one word: "HOLLYWOOD". The OCR output is the same word. Since they are identical, even if there were minor differences like case, but here they are the same. Also, since it's a single word, there's no issue with order or other words. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if some match, 3 if none. Here, the OCR output has the exact same word as the ground truth. So all unique words (just one) are present. Therefore, category 1 applies. 

I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 1.
