gt_text: 42
vlm_output: The number in the image is "42".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "42". The VLM OCR output is "The number in the image is "42".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the main part here is the number "42" mentioned. The task says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is "42", which is just a number. So the unique words in the ground truth are just the word "42". But wait, is "42" considered a word here? Since it's a number, maybe it's treated as a single token.

Then, the OCR output's text is "The number in the image is "42"." So the extracted text would be that entire sentence. Now, comparing the unique words from the ground truth (which is just "42") to the OCR output. The OCR output includes the word "42" in quotes, but according to the instructions, we should ignore punctuation and extra spaces. Also, the OCR output has the word "number", "image", etc., but the ground truth only has "42". 

So the unique words in the ground truth are {"42"}. The OCR output has words like "The", "number", "in", "the", "image", "is", "42". So the OCR output does contain "42" as a word. Even though it's in quotes, the instruction says to ignore punctuation. So "42" is present in the OCR output. Therefore, all unique ground truth words (just "42") are present in the OCR output. So according to the categories, that's category 1 — Correct. 

Wait, but the ground truth is the text "42", which is a single number. The OCR output includes that number, so the match is correct. The other words in the OCR output don't matter because the ground truth only has "42". So the answer should be 1.
