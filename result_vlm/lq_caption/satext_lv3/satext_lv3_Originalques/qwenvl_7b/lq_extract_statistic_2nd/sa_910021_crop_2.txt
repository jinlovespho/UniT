gt_text: HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A
vlm_output: The image appears to be a photograph of a construction site or industrial area during sunset or sunrise, with the sky displaying warm hues of orange and yellow. There is a large crane in the foreground on the left side, and what looks like a building under construction or a large industrial structure in the background. The water in the foreground suggests that the site might be near a river or harbor. However, there is no text visible in the image.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "HEUNG- HEUNG- HEUNG-A". The VLM OCR output is a description of an image with a construction site, crane, sunset colors, etc., and it mentions there's no text visible.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a paragraph describing the image. The key part here is that it says "there is no text visible in the image." So the extracted text from the OCR would be that there's no text present.

Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-", "HEUNG-A". But the OCR output says there's no text. So the OCR output is stating that no text is present, while the ground truth is actually a text string. 

Now, considering the comparison rules: we need to check if the unique words from the ground truth are in the OCR output. The ground truth words are "HEUNG-" and "HEUNG-A" (since "HEUNG-" is repeated, but we consider unique words). However, the OCR output says there's no text, so it's not mentioning any of these words. Therefore, none of the ground truth words are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words are present, 2 if at least one, 3 if none. Since the OCR output says no text is visible, and the ground truth is text that's not detected, the OCR output is incorrect. So the category would be 3.
