gt_text: CROWNE PLAZA
vlm_output: The image appears to be a blurred or pixelated picture of a building with a blue sky in the background. The text "100" is faintly visible at the bottom left corner, but it's not clear if it's part of the image or added later.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "CROWNE PLAZA" and a VLM OCR output that describes an image with some text. The task is to determine which category (1, 2, or 3) the OCR output falls into based on specific criteria.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output mentions that the text "100" is faintly visible at the bottom left corner. So the extracted text here is "100".

Next, compare this extracted text with the ground truth "CROWNE PLAZA". The ground truth has two words: "CROWNE" and "PLAZA". The OCR output has "100", which is a number, not a word. 

Now, applying the comparison rules:
- Word order doesn't matter, but here the OCR output has no words from the ground truth. 
- The unique words in the ground truth are "CROWNE" and "PLAZA". The OCR output has "100", which isn't part of those words. 
- Ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and spacing doesn't help here because "100" is a number and not a word. 
- Typos aren't an issue since there's no matching text at all.

Since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, the category should be 3 — Incorrect. The OCR output didn't capture any of the expected words, and the text it did capture is unrelated.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 208
2. Slightly Correct Num: 97
3. Incorrect Num: 514
