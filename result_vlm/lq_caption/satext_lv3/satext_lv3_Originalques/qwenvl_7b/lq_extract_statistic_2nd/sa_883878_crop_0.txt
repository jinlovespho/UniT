gt_text: Neil
vlm_output: Neil

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Neil" and the VLM OCR output is also "Neil". The task is to compare them based on the given steps.

First, extract the text from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; it's just "Neil".

Next, compare with the ground truth. The instructions say word order doesn't matter. Since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are just "Neil". The OCR output has the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are capitalized as "Neil" so that's the same. No punctuation or spaces to worry about. There's no typo here either. So the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth. 

According to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Since "Neil" is the only word and it's present, the answer should be 1.
