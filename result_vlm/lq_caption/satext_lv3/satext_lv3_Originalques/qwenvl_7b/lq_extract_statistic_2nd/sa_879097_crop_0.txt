gt_text: 251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "251".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is "251".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The OCR text in the image is "251"." So, the actual extracted text would be "The OCR text in the image is 251". But I guess we need to consider only the words that are part of the OCR result. However, the problem says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Wait, the OCR output is the text that the model extracted, which in this case is "The OCR text in the image is "251"." So the extracted text includes the phrase "251" as part of the sentence. But the ground truth is "251 DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION". 

Now, the next step is to compare the extracted text with the ground truth based on the given criteria. Let's break down the criteria:

- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces.
- Small typos still count as matches.

The ground truth has the words: "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". Wait, "DEPT" is short for Department, but the OCR output has "251" as part of its text. The OCR output's text is "The OCR text in the image is 251". So the words here are "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "251". 

But the unique words in the ground truth are "251", "DEPT", "OF", "TRANSPORTATION". The OCR output only has "251" as a word that's present. The other words in the ground truth (DEPT, OF, TRANSPORTATION) are not present in the OCR output. 

So, the unique words from the ground truth that are in the OCR output: only "251". The other words (DEPT, OF, TRANSPORTATION) are not present. 

But the category is based on whether all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the OCR output only has "251" and the ground truth has four unique words, the OCR output is missing three of them. Therefore, according to the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, only one out of four is present.

2 — Slightly correct (partially correct): at least one but not all unique words match. Since there's at least one (251) but not all, this would be category 2.

Wait, but the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the OCR output must contain all of those words (ignoring order, case, etc.) for category 1. Since the OCR output only has "251" and the ground truth has four words, then the OCR output is missing three words. Therefore, it's not category 1. But since it has at least one (251), it's category 2. 

But wait, the ground truth has "251" as one of the words, and the OCR output includes "251". So even though the other words are missing, since at least one is present, it's category 2. 

But wait, the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth". So the OCR output needs to have all of those words. Since it's missing three, it's not correct. But since it has at least one, it's partially correct. So the answer is 2.
