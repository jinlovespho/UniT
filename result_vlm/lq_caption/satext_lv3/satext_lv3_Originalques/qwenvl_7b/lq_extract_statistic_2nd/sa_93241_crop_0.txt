gt_text: ARMARIS
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "100"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ARMARIS" and the OCR output is "100". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "100", so that's the text to compare.

Next, the comparison steps. The ground truth has the word "ARMARIS". The OCR output is "100", which is a number. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "ARMARIS" is the only word in the ground truth, I need to check if it's present in the OCR output.

But the OCR output is "100", which is a number, not the word "ARMARIS". The rules mention that small typos still count as matches, but here the OCR output is completely different. Also, the instructions say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, but "100" is a number, not a word. There's no overlap in the words. 

So the category would be 3 because there are no matching words. The OCR output doesn't have "ARMARIS" or any of its variations. Even if there were typos, "100" doesn't resemble "ARMARIS" in any way. Therefore, the answer should be category 3.
