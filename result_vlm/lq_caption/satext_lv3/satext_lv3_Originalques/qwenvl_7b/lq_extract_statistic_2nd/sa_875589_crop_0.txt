gt_text: 4022 Rossau
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "1992"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "4022 Rossau" and the VLM OCR output is "1992". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "1992", which is just a number. 

Next, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "4022" and "Rossau". The OCR output only has "1992". 

Looking at the categories: 

- Category 1 requires all unique words from the ground truth to be present in the OCR output. But here, the OCR output has "1992" which doesn't match either "4022" or "Rossau". 

- Category 2 is for at least one match. However, "1992" doesn't match "4022" (they are different numbers) and "Rossau" is a name, which isn't present in the OCR output. 

- Category 3 is for no matches or unrelated. Since the OCR output has a number, but the ground truth has a number and a name, there's no overlap. The OCR output is unrelated to the ground truth. 

So the answer should be category 3.
