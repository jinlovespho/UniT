gt_text: Duty
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Duty".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Duty". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads "Duty"." So, first, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "Duty" in quotes. 

Step 1: Extract the text content. The main text here is "The text in the image reads "Duty"." But the actual extracted text would be "Duty" since that's what's in the quotes. Wait, but maybe the extraction is supposed to capture all the text, but the instruction says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. So maybe the OCR output is the entire sentence, but the actual text content is "Duty" as that's what's in the image. Hmm, but the problem says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output is the sentence, but perhaps the actual extracted text is "Duty" as the OCR recognized that. Wait, the OCR output is "The text in the image reads "Duty"." So the extracted text would be the entire sentence, but the ground truth is "Duty". 

Wait, maybe the VLM OCR output is the text that the model extracted from the image. So the model's output is the sentence "The text in the image reads "Duty"." So the extracted text is that entire sentence. But the ground truth is "Duty". So the comparison is between the OCR output (the sentence) and the ground truth ("Duty"). 

But the instructions for step 2 say to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering word order doesn't matter, unique words from ground truth, etc. 

So the ground truth has the word "Duty". The OCR output has the word "Duty" in it. So the unique words in the ground truth are just "Duty". The OCR output includes "Duty" as a word. So according to the criteria, since all unique ground truth words (which is just "Duty") are present in the OCR output, even with possible typos (but there are none here), then it's category 1. 

Wait, but the OCR output is a sentence that includes "Duty" as part of the quoted text. So the extracted text from the OCR is "The text in the image reads "Duty"." So the words in the OCR output are "The", "text", "in", "the", "image", "reads", "Duty". The ground truth is "Duty". So the unique word in ground truth is "Duty", which is present in the OCR output. So according to the rules, since all unique words (only "Duty") are present, it's category 1. 

So the answer should be 1.
