gt_text: Dunelm
vlm_output: Dunelm

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Dunelm" and the VLM OCR output is also "Dunelm". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is exactly "Dunelm", that's straightforward. 

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But in this case, both are the same word.

Next, the comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Dunelm". The OCR output also has the same word. 

We need to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. However, both texts are exactly the same in terms of case and spacing. There's no punctuation here either. 

The note about small typos says they still count as matches. But there are no typos here; the OCR output is identical to the ground truth. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the OCR output has "Dunelm" and the ground truth is also "Dunelm", all unique words (just one here) are present. 

Therefore, the answer should be Category 1.
