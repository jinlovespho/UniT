gt_text: CITY MIAMI OF THE ORATED INCORP FLORIDA 96 18
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` THE CITY OF BOCA RATON ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the ground truth text is "CITY MIAMI OF THE ORATED INCORP FLORIDA 96 18" and the OCR output is "THE CITY OF BOCA RATON". The task is to compare these two texts based on specific criteria and categorize them into 1, 2, or 3.

First, I need to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output says "THE CITY OF BOCA RATON". So that's the text we need to compare with the ground truth.

Next, the comparison rules are a bit specific. Let's break them down:

- Word order doesn't matter. So even if the words are in a different sequence, it's okay.
- Compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to look at the unique words in the ground truth and check if they are present in the OCR output, regardless of order, case, spacing, or small typos.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. So "The" and "THE" are considered the same, and "Boca Raton" vs "BOCA RATON" would be same.
- Small typos still count as matches. So if there's a slight misspelling, it's considered a match.

Now, let's list out the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth text is "CITY MIAMI OF THE ORATED INCORP FLORIDA 96 18". Let's split this into individual words:

- CITY
- MIAMI
- OF
- THE
- ORATED
- INCORP
- FLORIDA
- 96
- 18

So the unique words here are: CITY, MIAMI, OF, THE, ORATED, INCORP, FLORIDA, 96, 18. Wait, but "THE" and "OF" are repeated in the OCR output. But the unique words are the distinct ones in the ground truth. So the OCR output needs to have all these unique words, but maybe not necessarily all of them. Wait, the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. So the OCR output must contain all the unique words from the ground truth, regardless of order, case, etc.

But looking at the OCR output: "THE CITY OF BOCA RATON". Let's split that into words:

- THE
- CITY
- OF
- BOCA
- RATON

So the unique words here are THE, CITY, OF, BOCA, RATON.

Now, comparing these to the ground truth's unique words: CITY, MIAMI, OF, THE, ORATED, INCORP, FLORIDA, 96, 18.

So the OCR output has THE, CITY, OF. That's three words from the ground truth. The other words in the ground truth are MIAMI, ORATED, INCORP, FLORIDA, 96, 18. None of these are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has BOCA and RATON, which are not in the ground truth. So the OCR output only matches three of the nine unique words from the ground truth.

But wait, the problem says to compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So we need to check if all of the ground truth's unique words are present in the OCR output. But in this case, the OCR output doesn't have MIAMI, ORATED, INCORP, FLORIDA, 96, 18. So only THE, CITY, OF are present. So that's three out of nine. Therefore, according to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. But wait, the category 1 is when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output is missing most of them, it's not category 1. But category 2 is when at least one but not all match. So in this case, three matches. So category 2. But wait, the problem says "based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth." So the OCR output needs to have all the unique words from the ground truth. But here, it's missing most. Therefore, the answer should be category 2 (partially correct) because some words match, but not all. However, the category 3 is when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since there are some matches (THE, CITY, OF), it's category 2. But wait, the ground truth has words like MIAMI, which the OCR output doesn't have. So the OCR output has three words that match, but the rest don't. Therefore, it's partially correct, category 2.
