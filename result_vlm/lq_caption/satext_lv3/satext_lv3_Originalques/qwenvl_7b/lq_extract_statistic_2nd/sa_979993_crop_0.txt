gt_text: VERSACE
vlm_output: VERSACE

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The ground truth text is "VERSACE" and the VLM OCR output is also "VERSACE". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "VERSACE".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions mention that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it would still count. But in this case, both are the same word.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "VERSACE" since it's a single word. The OCR output also has "VERSACE", so all unique words from the ground truth are present. 

They also mention ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Here, both are uppercase and have no spaces or punctuation, so that's a perfect match. Small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here.

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output exactly matches the ground truth, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be 1.
