gt_text: REDS
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "CINCINNATI REDS"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "REDS" and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: 'CINCINNATI REDS'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "CINCINNATI REDS". So the extracted text is "CINCINNATI REDS".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "REDS". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. Also, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "REDS".

Now, check if "REDS" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "CINCINNATI" and "REDS". So "REDS" is definitely there. The other word is "CINCINNATI", which isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking the unique words from the ground truth. 

Also, the instructions mention ignoring capitalization. The OCR output has "REDS" in uppercase, same as the ground truth, so that's fine. No typos here either. The spacing is correct as well. 

Since all unique words from the ground truth ("REDS") are present in the OCR output, the category should be 1 — Correct.
