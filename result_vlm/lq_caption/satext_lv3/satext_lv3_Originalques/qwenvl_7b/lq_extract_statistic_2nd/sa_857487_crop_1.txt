gt_text: MUSEUM
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` 1999 ```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MUSEUM", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  ``` 1999 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  ``` 1999 ```". So the actual text extracted here is "1999" surrounded by some other phrases. But the main content here is the number 1999.

Next, comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MUSEUM", which is a single word. The OCR output has "1999", which is a number. 

Now, looking at the comparison criteria. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MUSEUM". The OCR output's extracted text is "1999". 

Since the OCR output doesn't have the word "MUSEUM" in any form (even ignoring case, spacing, etc.), there's no match. The number 1999 is unrelated to the word "MUSEUM". 

So according to the categories, if none of the unique ground truth words are present, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
