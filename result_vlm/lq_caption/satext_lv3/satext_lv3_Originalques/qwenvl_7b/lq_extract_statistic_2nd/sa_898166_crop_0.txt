gt_text: Google google.ru
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Google".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Google google.ru". The OCR output from the VLM is "The text in the image reads 'Google'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "Google" is the text in the image. So the extracted text is just "Google".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "Google" and "google.ru". But the OCR only found "Google". 

The instructions say to consider the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the unique words here are "Google" and "google.ru". The OCR output has "Google" (case doesn't matter, so that's a match for "Google" or "google"). However, "google.ru" is a domain name. The OCR didn't mention anything about "google.ru", only "Google".

So, the OCR matched one of the two unique words. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. But wait, the ground truth has two unique words, and the OCR matched one. So that's partially correct. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
