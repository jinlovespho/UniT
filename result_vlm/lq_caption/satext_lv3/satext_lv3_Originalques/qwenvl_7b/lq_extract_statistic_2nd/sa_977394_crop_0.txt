gt_text: 40
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "40".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "40". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is '40'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the number 40. So the extracted text would be "The OCR text in the image is '40'." But the ground truth is just "40". 

Now, comparing them. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word, which is "40". The OCR output includes "40" as part of the sentence. So the unique words in the OCR output would be "The", "OCR", "text", "in", "the", "image", "is", "40". But the ground truth's unique words are just "40". 

So the OCR output contains "40", which is the same as the ground truth. Even though there are other words, the key is whether the unique words from the ground truth are present. Since "40" is present, even with other words around it, that should count as a correct match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has only "40" and the OCR output includes that, it's category 1. The other words in the OCR output don't matter because the ground truth only has "40". Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but here there's no typo. The OCR correctly identified "40" even though it's part of a longer sentence. 

So the answer should be 1.
