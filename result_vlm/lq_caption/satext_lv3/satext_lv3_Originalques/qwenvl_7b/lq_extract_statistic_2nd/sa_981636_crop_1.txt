gt_text: 04
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100% RECYCLED"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "04". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads:  "100% RECYCLED"".

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100% RECYCLED". So the extracted text here is "100% RECYCLED".

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth "04". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But the ground truth is just "04", which is two digits. The OCR output has "100% RECYCLED" which includes words like "100", "%", "RECYCLED".

Wait, the ground truth's unique words are just "04". The OCR output's unique words are "100%", "RECYCLED". So none of the words in the OCR output match "04". Even if we consider that "100%" might have a "0" in it, but the ground truth is "04", which is two digits. The OCR output doesn't have "04" anywhere. The words in the OCR are "100%", "RECYCLED", so the unique words are "100%", "RECYCLED". The ground truth is "04", which is a single word. Since there's no overlap in the unique words, even considering typos or parts of words, it seems like none of the words match. So according to category 3, which is incorrect if no words match. So the answer should be 3.
