gt_text: CENTER MEDICAL
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "СОЮЗ"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CENTER MEDICAL". The OCR output from the VLM is "СОЮЗ". First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "СОЮЗ". Now, comparing that to the ground truth.

The ground truth has two words: "CENTER" and "MEDICAL". The OCR output has one word: "СОЮЗ", which is Cyrillic for "SOYUZ" or "Union" in English. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So, the unique words are "CENTER" and "MEDICAL".

Now, the OCR output has "СОЮЗ", which is a different language and doesn't match either "CENTER" or "MEDICAL" in terms of spelling. Even if we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing, "СОЮЗ" isn't a typo of either of those words. The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one matches, 3 if none match.

Since neither "CENTER" nor "MEDICAL" are present in the OCR output, even considering typos, the answer should be category 3.
