gt_text: KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "KOMMUNISM VANGLA ON". The OCR output from the VLM is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output. The extracted text is "KOMMUNISM ON VANGLA". 

Now, comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "KOMMUNISM", "VANGLA", and "ON". The OCR output has the same words but in a different order. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The ground truth words are all in uppercase, and the OCR output is also uppercase, so that's consistent.

Next, check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. The ground truth has three unique words: KOMMUNISM, VANGLA, ON. The OCR output has exactly those three words. Even though the order is different, the problem states that order doesn't matter. Also, there are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output has all the words correctly. 

So according to the categories, since all unique words are present, it's category 1. The answer should be 1.
