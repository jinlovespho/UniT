gt_text: MAIRIE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%" "100%"

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MAIRIE". The VLM OCR output says: "The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%" "100%"." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100%" three times. So the extracted text would be "100%", "100%", "100%".

Now step 2: compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is "MAIRIE", which is a French word for "municipality" or "town hall". The OCR output has three instances of "100%".

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "MAIRIE". The OCR output has "100%" as the only unique word. 

So, do they match? The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But "MAIRIE" is a word, and "100%" is a percentage. They are different words. There's no overlap in the unique words. The OCR output has "100%", which isn't related to "MAIRIE". 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none. Since the OCR output has none of the ground truth words, it's category 3. Even if there were typos, like "mairie" vs "mairie", but here the OCR output is completely different. So the answer should be 3.
