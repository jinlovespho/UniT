gt_text: 700
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "TNT".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "700" and the VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'TNT'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "The text in the image reads 'TNT'." So the actual text extracted would be "TNT" since that's what's in quotes. But maybe I should consider all the words? Wait, the instruction says to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text in the image is "TNT". So the extracted text is "TNT".

Now, step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "700". The unique words in the ground truth are just "700". The OCR output's extracted text is "TNT", which is a different word. 

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has "700" and the OCR has "TNT", there's no overlap. Also, considering that the OCR output's text is "TNT" versus the ground truth's "700", there's no match. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none. Since there are no matching words, it's category 3. Also, the output is unrelated to the ground truth. So the answer should be 3.
