gt_text: POLITIE POLITIE
vlm_output: POLITIE

Okay, let's see here. The ground truth text is "POLITIE POLITIE", and the VLM OCR output is "POLITIE". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is just "POLITIE", so that's straightforward.

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. Also, we should compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has "POLITIE" repeated twice, but the unique words are just "POLITIE".

Next, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra or missing spaces. The OCR output is "POLITIE" which is all caps, same as the ground truth. So no issue there. Also, there are no punctuation marks or spaces to worry about here.

Small typos still count as matches. But in this case, the OCR output is exactly "POLITIE", which is the same as the unique word in the ground truth. So there's no typo here.

Now, the categories: 

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has only "POLITIE" as the unique word, and the OCR output has that exact word, this should be category 1. 

Wait, but the ground truth has two instances of "POLITIE", but the OCR has one. However, the instruction says to compare based on the set of unique words. So even if the OCR has fewer instances, as long as all unique words from the ground truth are present, it's correct. Since the ground truth's unique words are just "POLITIE", and the OCR has that, it's correct. So category 1.
