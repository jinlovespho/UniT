Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "SosteniamoMarco". The VLM OCR output says there's no visible text in the image. 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions that there's no visible text that can be read or transcribed. So the extracted text here would be that there's no text present.

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "Sosteniamo" and "Marco". The OCR output didn't find any text, so it's essentially saying there's nothing to compare. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 requires all unique words from the ground truth to be present in the OCR output. But since the OCR output says there's no text, none of the words are present. Category 3 is for when no words match or the output is unrelated. Since the OCR output is stating there's no text, which is unrelated to the ground truth text, it should be Category 3. Even though the OCR output is about the image, the task is to compare the extracted text (which is none) with the ground truth words. Therefore, no matches, so Category 3.
