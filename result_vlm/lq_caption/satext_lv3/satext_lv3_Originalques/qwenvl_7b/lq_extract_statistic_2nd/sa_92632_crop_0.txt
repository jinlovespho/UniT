gt_text: SQUARE SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE 1BLE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Coca-Cola".

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output.

First, the ground truth text is "SQUARE SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE 1BLE". Let me break that down into unique words. The words here are "SQUARE", "SHIBUYA", "SCRAMBLE", and "1BLE". So, four unique words. I need to check if the OCR output contains these words, considering the specified conditions.

The OCR output is "The text in the image reads "Coca-Cola"." So the extracted text here is "Coca-Cola". Now, I need to compare this with the ground truth words. 

The rules say that word order doesn't matter, and we should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Also, small typos still count as matches. However, the OCR output has "Coca-Cola" which is a single word. The ground truth words are "SQUARE", "SHIBUYA", "SCRAMBLE", and "1BLE". None of these words are present in the OCR output. 

Wait, "Coca-Cola" doesn't match any of the ground truth words. Even if we ignore case, "coca-cola" is still not "square", "shibuya", "scramble", or "1ble". There's no overlap. So according to the categories:

1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. But here, none do.
2 — Slightly correct: at least one but not all. But here, zero match.
3 — Incorrect: no words match, or the output is unrelated. 

So this should be category 3. The OCR output is entirely unrelated to the ground truth words. Even if "Coca-Cola" was a typo for one of the words, but there's no indication of that. The words are completely different. Therefore, the answer is 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 150
2. Slightly Correct Num: 63
3. Incorrect Num: 369
