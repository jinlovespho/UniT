gt_text: 30
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  ``` 10 ```

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "30", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: ``` 10 ```". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The text in the image reads: ``` 10 ```". So the actual text here is "10" inside the code block. The rest is just descriptive text, so the extracted text would be "10".

Now, comparing that with the ground truth "30". The unique words in the ground truth are just "30". The OCR output has "10". The problem says to consider word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word in each, that's straightforward. 

Next, check if they match considering case, spacing, etc. Both are numbers, no capitalization issues here. But the numbers are different: 10 vs 30. The instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. However, 10 and 30 are not typos of each other. A typo might be like "30" vs "30" with a space, but here it's a different number entirely. 

So the OCR output has "10" instead of "30". Since the ground truth is "30", the OCR output doesn't have the correct number. Therefore, the unique word "30" isn't present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Here, the OCR output has "10" which is a different number. So no words match. Hence, category 3.

LLM classification result: 3
1. Correct Num: 219
2. Slightly Correct Num: 100
3. Incorrect Num: 530
