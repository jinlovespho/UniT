gt_text: Uber
vlm_output: The text in the image is "Uber".

----------------------------

Okay, let's break this down. The ground truth text is "Uber". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is "Uber"." 

Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. So, the OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "Uber". The rest is just descriptive text.

Step 2: Compare the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just the word "Uber". The OCR output includes "Uber" as part of the sentence. 

Now, considering the criteria: word order doesn't matter, but we're looking at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "Uber". The OCR output has "Uber" in it. Even though there are other words like "The", "text", "in", "image", "is", they don't matter because the unique words in the ground truth are only "Uber". 

The comparison is based on whether all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Uber" is present, even with the other words, it meets the criteria for category 1. 

Also, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here. The OCR output correctly has "Uber". So, all unique words (just "Uber") are present. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
