gt_text: AMP
vlm_output: AMP

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "AMP" and the VLM OCR output is also "AMP". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output, which in this case is straightforward since it's just "AMP". 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so even if the words were in a different order, it wouldn't affect the result. But here, both are exactly "AMP".

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since the ground truth has one unique word "AMP" and the OCR output also has "AMP", that's a perfect match. The other factors like capitalization, spacing, and typos are ignored, but there are no issues here. 

So, the answer should be category 1.
