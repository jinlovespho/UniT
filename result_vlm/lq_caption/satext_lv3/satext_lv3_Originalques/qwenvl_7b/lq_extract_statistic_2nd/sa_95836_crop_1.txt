Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "ROVER" and the VLM OCR output is also "ROVER". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Well, the OCR output is already "ROVER", so that's straightforward. 

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But here, both are just one word, "ROVER". So the order is the same, but even if it wasn't, since there's only one word, order wouldn't affect it.

Next, comparing based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "ROVER". The OCR output also has "ROVER". So the sets are identical. 

Then, ignoring capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both are all caps, same as the ground truth. No punctuation or spaces to worry about here. 

Small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos here; both are exactly the same. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the OCR output has the same word, it's a perfect match. So the answer should be category 1.
