gt_text: 23A
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: '20'

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "23A" and the OCR output is "20". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "20". Then compare it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, so that's not an issue here. The unique words in the ground truth are "23A". Wait, but "23A" is a single word, right? So the OCR output is "20", which is a single word as well.

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has "23A", and the OCR has "20". The problem says to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. But here, both are numbers and letters, but "23A" vs "20". Are these considered as having any matching words? The instruction also says small typos still count as matches. But "23A" and "20" don't seem like typos of each other. Like, "20" is missing the '3A' part. 

So the unique words in ground truth are "23A", and the OCR output has "20". Since there's no overlap in the words, even considering typos, maybe they don't match. But wait, the OCR output is "20" which is a number, and the ground truth is "23A" which is a mix of number and letter. Are they considered different words? 

The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches but not all, 3 if none match. Since the OCR output has "20" and the ground truth is "23A", there's no matching word. So it would be category 3. But wait, maybe the OCR output is missing some parts. But according to the rules, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has one unique word: "23A". The OCR output has "20", which is different. So no match. Hence, category 3.
