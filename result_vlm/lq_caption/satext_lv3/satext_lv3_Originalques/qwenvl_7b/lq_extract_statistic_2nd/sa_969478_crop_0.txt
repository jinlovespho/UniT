gt_text: AIRWAYS DE
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "KOSMOS".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "AIRWAYS DE". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'KOSMOS'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "KOSMOS" as the text in the image. So the extracted text here is "KOSMOS".

Now, comparing that to the ground truth "AIRWAYS DE". The ground truth has two words: "AIRWAYS" and "DE". The OCR output has "KOSMOS", which is a single word.

Looking at the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, but we need to check if all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. But "KOSMOS" doesn't have any of the words from the ground truth. "AIRWAYS" and "DE" aren't in "KOSMOS". 

So, since none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output, that would be category 3. The OCR output is unrelated and doesn't match any part of the ground truth words. Even if there were typos, but here the words are completely different. So the answer should be 3.
