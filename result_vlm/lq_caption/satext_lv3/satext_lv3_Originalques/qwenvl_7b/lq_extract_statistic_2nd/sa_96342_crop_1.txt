gt_text: 60
vlm_output: The image contains the following text:  ``` STOP ```

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "60", and the VLM OCR output is "The image contains the following text:  ``` STOP ```". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence that includes the word "STOP" within some formatting (backticks). So the extracted text would be "The image contains the following text: STOP".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth "60". The comparison has specific rules: word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words in the ground truth, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth is "60", which is a single word. The OCR output's extracted text includes words like "The", "image", "contains", "following", "text", and "STOP". None of these words are "60" or any variation of it. Even considering typos, "STOP" isn't close to "60". The other words in the OCR output are unrelated to the ground truth. 

Since there are no matching words between the OCR output and the ground truth, according to the categories, this would fall under category 3: Incorrect. There's no match at all, and the output is unrelated to the ground truth.
