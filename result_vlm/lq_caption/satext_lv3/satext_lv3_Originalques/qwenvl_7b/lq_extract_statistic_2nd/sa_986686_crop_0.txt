gt_text: AIA CCB
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "AIA".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the OCR output from the VLM.

First, the ground truth text is "AIA CCB". So the unique words here are "AIA" and "CCB". Now, looking at the VLM OCR output: "The text in the image reads "AIA"." The extracted text content from this output is just "AIA".

Next, I need to compare the extracted text with the ground truth, considering the specified factors. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, and we should compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Also, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. However, even with these considerations, the OCR output only has "AIA" while the ground truth has both "AIA" and "CCB".

Since the OCR output is missing the "CCB" part, which is a unique word in the ground truth, it doesn't meet the criteria for category 1. But it does have one of the two words. According to the categories, if at least one but not all unique words match, it's category 2. The output isn't empty or unrelated, so category 3 doesn't apply here. Therefore, the answer should be category 2.
