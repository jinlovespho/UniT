gt_text: DBS DBS
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "DBS DBS", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is:  ``` 1234567890 ```". 

First, Step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output here is "1234567890" enclosed in some text. So the extracted text would be "1234567890".

Next, Step 2 requires comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has the words "DBS" and "DBS" again. But since we're considering unique words, the set is just {"DBS"}.

Now, the comparison rules: word order doesn't matter, we only look at unique words from the ground truth. Also, ignore case, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. However, the OCR output here is "1234567890", which is a sequence of numbers. The ground truth is "DBS" which is letters. 

So, checking if any of the unique words from the ground truth (which is "DBS") are present in the OCR output. The OCR output has numbers, not letters. There's no "DBS" or any variation of it. Even if we consider typos, "1234567890" doesn't resemble "DBS" in any way. The letters D, B, S are not present in the OCR text. 

Therefore, none of the unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. According to the categories, that would be category 3: Incorrect. The output is unrelated and doesn't match any words from the ground truth.
