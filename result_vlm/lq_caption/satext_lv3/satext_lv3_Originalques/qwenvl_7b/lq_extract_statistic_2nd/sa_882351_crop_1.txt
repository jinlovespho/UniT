gt_text: FedEx Express
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "FedEx".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison between the ground truth text and the VLM OCR output. 

First, the ground truth text is "FedEx Express". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads "FedEx".".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "FedEx", so the extracted text here is "FedEx".

Now, moving to Step 2: Comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "FedEx" and "Express". The OCR output only has "FedEx".

The criteria given are:
- Word order doesn't matter.
- Compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth.
- Ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, etc.
- Small typos still count as matches.

So, looking at the unique words in the ground truth: "FedEx" and "Express". The OCR output has "FedEx" but not "Express". 

Since the OCR output contains one of the two unique words from the ground truth, that would fall under "partially correct" which is category 2. The category definitions state that category 1 is when all unique words match, category 2 is when at least one but not all match, and category 3 is when none match or it's unrelated. 

In this case, since only "FedEx" is present and "Express" is missing, it's not fully correct (so not category 1), but it's not completely wrong either. Therefore, category 2 is the right choice.
