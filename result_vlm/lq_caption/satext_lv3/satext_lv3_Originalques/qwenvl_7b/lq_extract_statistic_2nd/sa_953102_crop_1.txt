gt_text: 95
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image is "95".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "95". The VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image is "95".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text it's supposed to capture is "95". The OCR output says "The OCR text in the image is "95"." So the extracted text would be "95" here, right? Because that's the part that's in quotes.

Now, comparing that to the ground truth, which is also "95". The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Wait, the ground truth is just "95", which is a single word. The OCR output's extracted text is "95" as well. So the unique words in the ground truth are just {"95"}, and the OCR output has {"95"} as well. So all unique words match. 

The categories are 1 for correct, 2 for partially correct, 3 for incorrect. Since all the unique words (just "95") are present in the OCR output, even though the OCR output has more text around it, the extracted text is exactly "95". So that's a correct match. The other parts of the OCR output like "The OCR text in the image is" are probably not considered since the task is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Wait, but step 1 says to extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The VLM OCR output is the entire sentence. But the actual text in the image is "95", so maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text that's extracted, which is "95". So the extracted text is "95", which matches the ground truth exactly. Therefore, category 1.

But maybe I need to check if the OCR output's text is "95" as the main content. The VLM OCR output is a statement that the text in the image is "95". So the actual OCR result is "95", and the rest is just a description. So the extracted text would be "95", which is correct. So category 1.
