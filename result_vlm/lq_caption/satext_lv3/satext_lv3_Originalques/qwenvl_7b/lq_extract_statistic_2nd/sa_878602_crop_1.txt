gt_text: MEDELLIN
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "MEDELLIN".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "MEDELLIN". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'MEDELLIN'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text they're referring to is "MEDELLIN". So the extracted text would be "MEDELLIN".

Now step 2 is comparing that extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is also "MEDELLIN". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "MEDELLIN". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same word. 

They mention ignoring capitalization, but both are uppercase. Also, no punctuation or extra spaces. The OCR output's extracted text is exactly the same as the ground truth. There are no typos here. So all unique words in the ground truth (just one) are present in the OCR output. 

So according to the categories, that's category 1: Correct. All unique words match. There's no partial or incorrect here. The answer should be 1.
