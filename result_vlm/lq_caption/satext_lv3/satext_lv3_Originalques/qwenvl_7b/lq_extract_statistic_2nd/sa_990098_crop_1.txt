gt_text: Card only
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Card only."

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "Card only", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Card only.'" 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "The text in the image reads 'Card only.'" So the actual text here is "Card only" within quotes. 

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "Card only". The OCR output has "Card only" as well. Now, considering the rules:

- Word order doesn't matter. Both have the same words.
- Unique words in ground truth: "Card" and "only". The OCR output has both of these words.
- Ignore capitalization: The OCR output has "Card" which is capitalized, same as the ground truth. "Only" in the ground truth is lowercase, but the OCR output has "only" lowercase. But the rules say to ignore capitalization, so that's okay.
- Punctuation and spaces: The OCR output has extra words like "The text in the image reads" but we're supposed to focus on the set of unique words from the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "Card only", the OCR output includes those exact words. The extra text in the OCR output doesn't affect the comparison because we're only checking the presence of the ground truth words.
- Typos: There are no typos here. "Card" and "only" are both correctly spelled.

So, all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. Therefore, according to the categories, this should be category 1 — Correct.
