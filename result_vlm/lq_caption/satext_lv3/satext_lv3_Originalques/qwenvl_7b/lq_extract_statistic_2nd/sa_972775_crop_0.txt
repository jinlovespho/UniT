gt_text: PLM 9H
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "9H-PLM".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "PLM 9H". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads '9H-PLM'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The main part here is "9H-PLM". The rest is just describing that it's the text in the image.

Next, comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth has two parts: "PLM" and "9H". The OCR output has "9H-PLM". 

The instructions say word order doesn't matter. So even if the order is different, like "9H-PLM" vs "PLM 9H", that's okay. Also, we should ignore punctuation. The hyphen in "9H-PLM" might be considered as just a separator, but since the ground truth doesn't have a hyphen, do we treat that as a typo or just ignore it? The instructions mention ignoring punctuation, so maybe the hyphen is ignored. 

So breaking down the OCR text: "9H-PLM" becomes "9H" and "PLM" when we remove the hyphen. The ground truth is "PLM" and "9H". The unique words in ground truth are "PLM" and "9H". The OCR output has both of those words. 

Capitalization is ignored, so "PLM" and "9H" in the OCR match the ground truth. Also, the hyphen is considered punctuation and is ignored. So the OCR output has both required words. Therefore, it's a correct match. 

So the category should be 1.
