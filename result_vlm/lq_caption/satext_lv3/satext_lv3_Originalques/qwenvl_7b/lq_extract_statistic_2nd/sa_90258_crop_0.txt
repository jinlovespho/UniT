gt_text: CINDERELLA VIKING
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "Cruise"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "CINDERELLA VIKING". The OCR output from the VLM is "Cruise". 

First, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is just "Cruise". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter. Also, compare based only on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has two unique words: "Cinderella" and "Viking". 

Now, the OCR output is "Cruise". Let's check if any of the words from the ground truth are present. "Cruise" doesn't have "Cinderella" or "Viking" in it. Even if we ignore case, "cruise" vs "Cinderella" or "Viking" – no match. Also, typos are considered, but "Cruise" isn't a typo of either word. 

So, the OCR output doesn't contain any of the unique words from the ground truth. According to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The output is unrelated. So the answer should be 3.
