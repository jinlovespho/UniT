gt_text: Victoria
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Victoria Station".

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "Victoria", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Victoria Station'." 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "Victoria Station". So the extracted text here is "Victoria Station".

Now, Step 2 involves comparing this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is just "Victoria". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos.

The unique words in the ground truth are just "Victoria". The OCR output has "Victoria" as part of "Victoria Station". Since we're looking for the presence of the ground truth words in the OCR output, "Victoria" is present. Even though there's an extra word "Station", that doesn't matter because the comparison is based on the unique words from the ground truth. Also, the case is the same here, and there's no typo. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words (which is just "Victoria") are present in the OCR output, it's category 1. Even though there's an extra word, the presence of "Victoria" is sufficient. The other conditions like ignoring order, case, etc., are all satisfied here. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
