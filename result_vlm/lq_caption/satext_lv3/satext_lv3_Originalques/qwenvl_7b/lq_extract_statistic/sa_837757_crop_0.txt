gt_text: RESTAURANT
vlm_output: The text in the image reads: "1234567890"

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "RESTAURANT" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads: '1234567890'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says the text is "1234567890". So the extracted text is just the numbers 1 through 0.

Next, compare this with the ground truth. The ground truth is the word "RESTAURANT". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but we're comparing based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "RESTAURANT". 

Now, check if this word appears in the OCR output. The OCR output is numbers, so there's no "RESTAURANT" there. The problem mentions that small typos still count as matches, but in this case, there's no typo—there's just no matching word at all. 

The categories are: 1 if all unique words match, 2 if at least one but not all, and 3 if none match or it's unrelated. Since the OCR output has no words from the ground truth, it's category 3. Even though the OCR output is not empty, it's unrelated and doesn't contain the required word. So the answer should be 3.
