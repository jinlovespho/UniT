gt_text: MAXI
vlm_output: MAXI ZOO

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth is "MAXI" and the OCR output is "MAXI ZOO". So, first, I need to extract the text from the OCR output, which is "MAXI ZOO". Then, compare it with the ground truth.

The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I can ignore the order. The unique words in the ground truth are just "MAXI". The OCR output has "MAXI" and "ZOO". So, the unique words in the OCR output are "MAXI" and "ZOO".

Now, comparing the unique words. The ground truth has "MAXI", which is present in the OCR output. The OCR also has "ZOO", which isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we're only checking if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "MAXI" is there, even though there's an extra word, the category would be 1 — Correct. Because the requirement is that all unique ground truth words are in the OCR output, regardless of extra words. Also, the instructions mention ignoring extra spaces, so the space between MAXI and ZOO doesn't matter. Capitalization is ignored, but both are uppercase here. Typos aren't an issue here. So, category 1.
