Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DALIAN" and the VLM OCR output is also "DALIAN". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. Since the OCR output is "DALIAN", that's straightforward. The extracted text is "DALIAN".

Step 2 is comparing this with the ground truth. The instructions say that word order doesn't matter. But in this case, both are the same word. The ground truth has only one unique word: "DALIAN". The OCR output also has the same word. 

Next, considering the rules: ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces. Here, both are all caps, but even if they weren't, they'd still match. There are no typos mentioned here. The OCR output is exactly the same as the ground truth.

So, looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since the ground truth has one unique word and the OCR has that same word, it's a perfect match. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
