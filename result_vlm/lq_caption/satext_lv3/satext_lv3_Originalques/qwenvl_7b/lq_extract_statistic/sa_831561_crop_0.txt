gt_text: 2017
vlm_output: The OCR text in the image reads: "Santo Domingo"

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "2017", and the VLM OCR output is "The OCR text in the image reads: 'Santo Domingo'". 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR says "Santo Domingo". Now, comparing that to the ground truth "2017". 

The categories are based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth here is just the number 2017. But wait, the ground truth is "2017", which is a number, not words. The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. But "2017" isn't a word; it's a number. However, maybe the OCR output is supposed to capture that number. 

But the OCR output is "Santo Domingo", which are two words. The ground truth has no words, just a number. So if the ground truth is considered as having a unique word (even though it's a number), then the OCR output doesn't have that. But the problem is that the ground truth is "2017" which is a year, but the OCR output is a city name. So there's no overlap in words. 

Wait, the instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the ground truth is "2017", which is a single token, but not a word. However, maybe in this context, numbers are treated as words. But the OCR output has "Santo Domingo", which are two words. So none of the words in the OCR output match the ground truth's "2017". 

Therefore, according to the categories, if there are no words matching, it's category 3. But I need to check if "2017" is considered a word here. If the ground truth is a number, and the OCR output has words, then there's no match. So the answer would be category 3.
