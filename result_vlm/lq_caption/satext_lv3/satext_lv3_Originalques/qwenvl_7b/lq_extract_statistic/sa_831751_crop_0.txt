Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "DAK" and the VLM OCR output is also "DAK". So first, I need to follow the steps given.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "DAK".

Step 2 is comparing the extracted text with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces, and small typos still count as matches.

So the ground truth has the word "DAK". The OCR output is also "DAK". Since they are exactly the same, even if there were typos, but in this case, there are none. The unique words in the ground truth are just "DAK". The OCR output has "DAK" as well. So all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

Looking at the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since there's only one word here, and it's a match, it should be category 1. There's no case difference, no extra spaces, no typos. So the answer should be 1.
