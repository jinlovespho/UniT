gt_text: DEVEREUX
vlm_output: The image shows a view of a parking lot with several large trucks parked in it. There is a grassy embankment on the left side of the image, and a fence runs along the edge of the embankment. The background includes some trees and what appears to be a building or structure. There is no visible text in the image.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The ground truth text is "DEVEREUX". The VLM OCR output is a description of an image with a parking lot, trucks, grassy embankment, fence, trees, and a building. The user wants me to check if the OCR output contains the ground truth words, considering certain rules.

First, Step 1: Extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is the entire paragraph describing the image. The extracted text would be all the words in that paragraph. 

Step 2: Compare with the ground truth. The ground truth is "DEVEREUX", which is a single word. The OCR output doesn't mention any text in the image. The OCR says, "There is no visible text in the image." So the OCR output is stating that there's no text present. 

Now, the unique words in the ground truth are just "DEVEREUX". The OCR output's text doesn't include that word. The OCR output is about the image content, not about text. So the OCR didn't recognize the word "DEVEREUX" because it's not present in the image according to the OCR's description. 

But wait, the ground truth is the actual text that was supposed to be in the image. However, the OCR's output says there's no visible text. So the OCR didn't detect any text, which might be incorrect if the image actually had "DEVEREUX" written somewhere. But according to the problem statement, we have to go by the OCR's output. 

The rules say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "DEVEREUX" is the only word, and the OCR output doesn't have it, that means no words match. Therefore, the category would be 3 — Incorrect, because no words match. The OCR output is not mentioning the ground truth word, and it's stating there's no text, which would mean the OCR didn't find any text, hence not matching the ground truth. 

So the answer is 3.
