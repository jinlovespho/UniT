gt_text: PLAZA
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  MADRID PLAZA MAYOR

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "PLAZA" and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  MADRID PLAZA MAYOR". 

First, Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is a sentence, so I need to extract the actual words. The text after the colon is "MADRID PLAZA MAYOR". So the extracted text would be the words "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR".

Next, Step 2 involves comparing these extracted words with the ground truth, which is "PLAZA". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so I don't need to check the sequence. Also, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has only one unique word: "PLAZA". 

Now, checking the OCR output words: "MADRID", "PLAZA", "MAYOR". The word "PLAZA" is present here. The other words are "MADRID" and "MAYOR", which are not in the ground truth. But since the ground truth only has "PLAZA", and the OCR output includes that exact word (ignoring case, which it's in uppercase here but the ground truth is uppercase too, so that's fine), then all unique words from the ground truth are present in the OCR output. 

The categories are: 
1 — Correct: all unique ground truth words appear in the OCR output. 
Since "PLAZA" is present, and there are no other words in the ground truth, this should be category 1. 

I need to make sure there are no typos. The OCR output has "PLAZA" exactly as in the ground truth, so no issues there. Also, ignoring extra spaces and punctuation, the OCR output's words are correctly identified. 

Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
