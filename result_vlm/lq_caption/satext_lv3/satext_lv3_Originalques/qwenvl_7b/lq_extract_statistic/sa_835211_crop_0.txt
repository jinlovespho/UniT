gt_text: SWITCH
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "Nintendo Switch".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "SWITCH", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads 'Nintendo Switch'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output says "Nintendo Switch". So the extracted text is "Nintendo Switch".

Next, comparing this with the ground truth "SWITCH". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words from the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "SWITCH". The OCR output has "Nintendo" and "Switch". Now, "Switch" is present in the OCR output. Since we ignore capitalization, "Switch" matches "SWITCH". Even though there's an extra word "Nintendo", the key is that all unique words in the ground truth are present. The ground truth only has "SWITCH", and the OCR output includes "Switch", which is a match. 

So according to the categories, if all unique ground truth words are present, it's category 1. Even though there's an extra word, the presence of "Switch" covers the ground truth. So the answer should be 1.
