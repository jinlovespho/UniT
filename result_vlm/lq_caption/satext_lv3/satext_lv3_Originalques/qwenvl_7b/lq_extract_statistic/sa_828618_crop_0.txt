gt_text: BUT
vlm_output: The text in the image is "BUT".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "BUT". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is "BUT".".

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. So the OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "BUT" in quotes. The actual text content here is "The text in the image is BUT." But I think the task is to extract the text that's being recognized, which in this case is "BUT" as the main content. Wait, maybe I need to parse the OCR output. The OCR output says "The text in the image is "BUT"." So the actual text extracted from the image is "BUT", which is in quotes. So the extracted text would be "BUT" (without the surrounding text). But the instruction says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So perhaps the OCR output is the entire sentence, and we need to extract the text that's being described. For example, if the OCR says "The text is BUT", then the extracted text is "BUT".

So in this case, the OCR output is "The text in the image is "BUT"." So the actual extracted text is "BUT", right? Because the OCR is stating that the image contains the text "BUT". Therefore, the extracted text from the OCR output is "BUT".

Then, step 2 is to compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "BUT". The extracted text is "BUT". Now, the comparison rules say that word order doesn't matter, but since there's only one word, that's not an issue. The unique words in the ground truth are just "BUT". The OCR output's extracted text is exactly "BUT", so all unique words (only one) match. Also, considering case, but the OCR output is in uppercase, same as the ground truth. So no issues there. No typos, since it's exactly the same. Therefore, this should be category 1 — correct.

Wait, but what if the OCR output had something like "but" in lowercase? The rules say to ignore capitalization, so even if it was lowercase, it would still be considered a match. But in this case, both are uppercase. So the answer is 1.
