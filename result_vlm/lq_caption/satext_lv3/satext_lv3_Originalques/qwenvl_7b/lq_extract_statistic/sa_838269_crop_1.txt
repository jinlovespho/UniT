gt_text: Google
vlm_output: The text in the image is "Google".

----------------------------

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Google". The VLM OCR output is "The text in the image is "Google".".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence that includes the word "Google" in quotes. So the extracted text would be "The text in the image is Google." But maybe I should just focus on the actual words, not the punctuation. Wait, the instructions say to ignore punctuation. So maybe I should process the OCR output by removing punctuation and then split into words.

Wait, the steps are: Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is "The text in the image is "Google"." So the text content here is the entire sentence, but maybe I need to extract the actual words. But maybe the OCR output is considered as the text, so the extracted text would be "The text in the image is Google" (without the quotes, but the quotes might be part of the OCR's output). Wait, the user says "extract the text content from the VLM OCR output." So the OCR output is the sentence "The text in the image is "Google"." So the extracted text is that entire string. But then, in step 2, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "Google", which is one word. So the unique words in ground truth are {"Google"}.

Now, comparing the OCR output's extracted text. Let's process the OCR output text. The OCR output is "The text in the image is "Google"." So the words here, after ignoring punctuation and case, would be: The, text, in, the, image, is, Google. But the ground truth is "Google". So the OCR output has "Google" as one of the words. Since the ground truth's unique words are just "Google", and the OCR output includes "Google", then all unique ground truth words are present. So that would be category 1. But wait, the instructions say to ignore case, so "Google" in the OCR is same as the ground truth. Also, the OCR output has "Google" as a word. So even though there are other words, as long as all unique words in the ground truth are present, it's correct. Since the ground truth has only "Google", and the OCR output has "Google", then it's correct. So category 1.
