gt_text: MAN
vlm_output: The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%" "100%"

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The ground truth text is "MAN", and the VLM OCR output is "The text in the image reads:  "100%" "100%" "100%"".

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output mentions "100%" three times. So the extracted text is "100%", "100%", "100%". 

Next, compare this with the ground truth, which is "MAN". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth, ignore capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and small typos. 

The ground truth has one unique word: "MAN". The OCR output has "100%" as the only unique word. Now, checking if "100%" matches "MAN" under the given conditions. But "100%" is a number with a percent sign, while "MAN" is a word. There's no overlap here. Even if I consider typos, "100%" doesn't resemble "MAN" in any way. The categories are: 1 if all unique ground truth words are present, 2 if at least one matches, 3 otherwise. Since none of the OCR words match "MAN", it should be category 3. 

Wait, but the OCR output has three instances of "100%", but the ground truth is "MAN". There's no match here. So the answer should be 3.
