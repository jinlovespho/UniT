gt_text: mL
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "120mL".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "mL". The VLM OCR output says "The text in the image reads '120mL'." 

First, I need to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text mentioned is "120mL". So the extracted text here would be "120mL".

Next, compare this with the ground truth "mL". The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, compare based on unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "mL". 

Now, check if "mL" is present in the OCR output. The OCR output has "120mL". The "mL" is part of that, even though there's a "120" in front. But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "mL" is a substring here, but the OCR output's extracted text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the word. However, the instructions mention that small typos still count as matches, but here it's not a typo—it's just that the OCR output includes more text. 

Wait, the ground truth is just "mL", and the OCR output has "120mL". So the OCR output contains "mL" as part of the text. But does that count as a match? The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "mL". The OCR output's extracted text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as a substring. But does that count as the word "mL" being present?

I think the key here is whether the OCR output includes the exact word "mL" or a variation. But in this case, "120mL" is a single word. However, the ground truth is "mL" as a standalone unit. But according to the instructions, we are to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So if the OCR output has "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the word, but not as a separate word. Wait, but maybe the OCR output is supposed to be the text in the image. If the image has "120mL", then the OCR output correctly extracted that text. The ground truth is "mL", but the OCR output has "120mL". 

But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth is "mL", so the unique word is "mL". The OCR output's text is "120mL". So does "120mL" contain "mL" as a substring? If the comparison is based on the presence of the exact words (ignoring order, case, spacing, typos), but the OCR output's text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the word. But the ground truth is "mL" as a standalone word. 

Wait, maybe the way to look at it is that the OCR output's text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. But the ground truth is "mL". Since the OCR output has "mL" as part of the text (even though there's a number before it), does that count as a match? The instructions say to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth has "mL", and the OCR output's text includes "mL" as a substring. However, the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words. If the OCR output's text is "120mL", then the unique words would be "120mL" (assuming that's a single word). But the ground truth's unique word is "mL". 

But the instructions also mention that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, it's not a typo but an extra number. The OCR output includes more text than the ground truth. But according to the instructions, the comparison is based on the presence of the unique words from the ground truth in the OCR output. 

So, the ground truth is "mL", and the OCR output has "120mL". Since "mL" is a part of the OCR output's text, even though it's combined with "120", does that count as a match? The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. If the OCR output's text includes "mL" as part of the words, even if it's part of a larger word, does that count? 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output is supposed to capture the exact text. For example, if the image has "mL", the OCR should output "mL". But in this case, the image has "120mL", so the OCR output correctly reads "120mL". However, the ground truth is "mL", which is a subset of the OCR output. 

But according to the instructions, the comparison is based on the unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "mL". The OCR output's text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. However, if we consider that the OCR output's text includes "mL" as a substring, but not as a separate word, does that count? 

The instructions don't specify whether the words need to be exact matches or if substrings count. But the example given in the instructions might clarify. For example, if the ground truth was "mL" and the OCR output was "mL", that's category 1. If the OCR output was "mLs" (a typo), it's still category 1. If the OCR output was "mL" with extra spaces, it's still category 1. But if the OCR output was "ml" (lowercase), it's still category 1. 

In this case, the OCR output is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. However, the ground truth is "mL", which is a subset. But the OCR output's text is "120mL", which contains "mL" as part of the word. So, does that count as the word "mL" being present in the OCR output? 

I think the answer here is that the OCR output includes the exact word "mL" as part of the text. Even though there's a "120" in front, the "mL" is still present. So the unique word from the ground truth ("mL") is present in the OCR output. Therefore, category 1 would apply because all unique ground truth words (which is just "mL") are present in the OCR output. 

But wait, the OCR output is "The text in the image reads '120mL'." So the extracted text is "120mL". The ground truth is "mL". So the OCR output's extracted text includes "mL" as part of "120mL". But the problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. So the ground truth's unique words are {"mL"}. The OCR output's text is "120mL", which contains "mL" as part of the word. But is "120mL" considered as containing the word "mL"? 

This is a bit ambiguous. If the OCR output's text is "120mL", then "mL" is a substring. However, if we are looking for the exact word "mL", then "120mL" doesn't contain that exact word. But the instructions say that small typos still count as matches. However, in this case, it's not a typo but an additional number. 

Alternatively, maybe the OCR output's text is "120mL", which includes "mL" as part of the text. The instructions say to ignore extra/missing spaces, but not sure about numbers. The problem says to compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. Since "mL" is present in the OCR output's text (even if it's part of a larger number), then it's considered a match. 

Therefore, the answer would be category 1.
