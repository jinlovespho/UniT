gt_text: Medical
vlm_output: Medical Centre

Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "Medical" and the VLM OCR output is "Medical Centre". 

First, I need to follow the steps given. Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output, which is already done here. The OCR output is "Medical Centre".

Step 2 is to compare this with the ground truth. The rules are that word order doesn't matter, we only look at the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "Medical". The OCR output has two words: "Medical" and "Centre".

So, considering that, the unique words in the ground truth are just "Medical". The OCR output includes "Medical" as one of its words. The other word, "Centre", isn't in the ground truth, but that's okay because we only need to check if all unique ground truth words are present in the OCR output. Since "Medical" is present, even though there's an extra word, it's still considered a correct match. The rules say that small typos still count as matches, but there are no typos here. Also, we ignore capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. The OCR output has "Medical" correctly spelled and capitalized. 

So according to the categories, category 1 is correct when all unique ground truth words are present. Since "Medical" is present, the answer should be category 1.
