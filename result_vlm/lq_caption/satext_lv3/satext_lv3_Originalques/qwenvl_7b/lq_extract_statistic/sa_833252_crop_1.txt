Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "easyJet" and the VLM OCR output is also "easyJet". So first, I need to follow the steps provided.

Step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. That's straightforward here; the OCR output is exactly "easyJet".

Step 2 is comparing it with the ground truth. The instructions say to consider word order doesn't matter, but since both are single words, order isn't an issue here. The comparison is based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "easyJet". The OCR output also has "easyJet".

Now, checking the other factors: ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. Both texts are the same in terms of case (all lowercase except 'J' which is uppercase in both). No punctuation or spaces to consider here. Also, small typos still count as matches. But there are no typos in this case.

So, since the OCR output contains all unique words from the ground truth (which is just one word), the category should be 1 — Correct. There's no partial match or any issues here. The answer is 1.
