gt_text: EEN
vlm_output: The text in the image appears to be "PILGRIM".

----------------------------

<think>
Okay, let's see. The ground truth text is "EEN" and the VLM OCR output says "The text in the image appears to be 'PILGRIM'." 

First, step 1 is to extract the text content from the OCR output. The OCR output here is "PILGRIM". So the extracted text is "PILGRIM".

Now step 2 is comparing that with the ground truth, which is "EEN". The instructions say that word order doesn't matter, so we just need to check if the words in the OCR output match the ground truth words. But wait, the ground truth is a single word "EEN", and the OCR output is "PILGRIM". 

The unique words in the ground truth are just "EEN". The OCR output has "PILGRIM" as the word. Now, comparing these two. The problem says to ignore capitalization, but both are uppercase here. Also, check for typos. But "PILGRIM" and "EEN" are completely different words. There's no overlap in letters or possible typos. For example, "EEN" could be a typo for "PEN" or "EEN" itself, but "PILGRIM" doesn't have any of those letters. 

So, the OCR output has none of the unique words from the ground truth. Therefore, according to the categories, if no words match, it's category 3. The answer should be 3.
