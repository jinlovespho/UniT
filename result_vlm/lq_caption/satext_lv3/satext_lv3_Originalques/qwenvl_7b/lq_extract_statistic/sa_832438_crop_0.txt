gt_text: mossos
vlm_output: The text in the image reads "mossos d'esquadra".

----------------------------

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a ground truth text "mossos" and an OCR output from a VLM which says "The text in the image reads 'mossos d'esquadra'." The task is to determine the category (1, 2, or 3) based on the comparison rules given.

First, I need to follow Step 1: Extract the text content from the VLM OCR output. The OCR output is a sentence, but the actual text in the image is "mossos d'esquadra". So the extracted text is "mossos d'esquadra".

Next, Step 2: Compare this extracted text with the ground truth. The ground truth is "mossos". The rules say that word order doesn't matter, we compare based on the set of unique words in the ground truth. The ground truth has one unique word: "mossos". The OCR output has two words: "mossos" and "d'esquadra".

Now, the comparison rules mention that we should consider only the unique words in the ground truth. Since the ground truth is "mossos", the OCR output includes "mossos" exactly as it is. The other word "d'esquadra" isn't in the ground truth, so it's irrelevant here. 

The rules also say to ignore capitalization, punctuation, and extra/missing spaces. But in this case, both "mossos" in the ground truth and the OCR output are lowercase, so no issue there. There's no punctuation to worry about here. The OCR output has an extra word, but since we're only checking if all unique ground truth words are present, and "mossos" is present, that's all that's needed.

Small typos still count as matches. However, there are no typos here. The OCR output has "mossos" correctly. 

So according to the categories: Category 1 is correct if all unique ground truth words are present. Since "mossos" is present in the OCR output, even though there's an extra word, it doesn't matter. The presence of the required word is sufficient. Therefore, the answer should be category 1.
